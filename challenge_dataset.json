SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES McCREARY COUNTY, KENTUCKY, et al. v .\nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF KENTUCKY et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the sixth circuit No. 03–1693.Argued March 2, 2005—Decided June 27,\n2005 After petitioners, two Kentucky Counties, each\nposted large, readily visible copies of the Ten Commandments in\ntheir courthouses, respondents, the American Civil Liberties Union\n(ACLU) et al., sued under 42 U. S. C. §1983 to enjoin the\ndisplays on the ground that they violated the First Amendment’s\nEstablishment Clause. The Counties then adopted nearly identical\nresolutions calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that\nthe Commandments are Kentucky’s “precedent legal code.”\nThe resolutions noted several grounds for taking that position,\nincluding the state legislature’s acknowledgment of Christ as the\n“Prince of Ethics.” The displays around the Commandments were\nmodified to include eight smaller, historical documents containing\nreligious references as their sole common element, e.g., the Declaration of Independence’s “endowed by their Creator”\npassage. Entering a preliminary injunction, the District Court\nfollowed the Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 , test to\nfind, inter alia , that the original display lacked any\nsecular purpose because the Commandments are a distinctly religious\ndocument, and that the second version lacked such a purpose because\nthe Counties narrowly tailored their selection of foundational\ndocuments to those specifically referring to Christianity. After\nchanging counsel, the Counties revised the exhibits again. No new\nresolution authorized the new exhibits, nor did the Counties repeal\nthe resolutions that preceded the second one. The new posting,\nentitled “The Foundations of American Law and Government Display,”\nconsists of nine framed documents of equal size. One sets out the\nCommandments explicitly identified as the “King James Version,”\nquotes them at greater length, and explains that they have\nprofoundly influenced the formation of Western legal thought and\nthis Nation. With the Commandments are framed copies of, e.g., the Star Spangled Banner’s lyrics and the\nDeclaration of Independence, accompanied by statements about their\nhistorical and legal significance. On the ACLU’s motion, the\nDistrict Court included this third display in the injunction\ndespite the Counties’ professed intent to show that the\nCommandments were part of the foundation of American Law and\nGovernment and to educate County citizens as to the documents. The\ncourt took proclaiming the Commandments’ foundational value as a\nreligious, rather than secular, purpose under Stone v. Graham, 449\nU. S. 39 , and found that the Counties’ asserted educational\ngoals crumbled upon an examination of this litigation’s history.\nAffirming, the Sixth Circuit stressed that, under Stone ,\ndisplaying the Commandments bespeaks a religious object unless they\nare integrated with a secular message. The court saw no integration\nhere because of a lack of a demonstrated analytical or historical\nconnection between the Commandments and the other\ndocuments. Held: 1. A\ndetermination of the Counties’ purpose is a sound basis for ruling\non the Establishment Clause complaints. The Counties’ objective may\nbe dispositive of the constitutional enquiry.\nPp. 10–19. (a) Lemon ’s\n“secular legislative purpose” enquiry, 403 U. S., at 612, has been\na common, albeit seldom dispositive, element of this Court’s cases, Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38 , 75. When\nthe government acts with the ostensible and predominant purpose of\nadvancing religion, it violates the central Establishment Clause\nvalue of official religious neutrality, there being no neutrality\nwhen the government’s ostensible object is to take sides. Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter&nbhyph;day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327 , 335. A\npurpose to favor one faith over another, or adherence to religion\ngenerally, clashes with the “understanding … that liberty and\nsocial stability demand a … tolerance that respects the religious\nviews of all citizens.” Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639 ,\n718. Pp. 11–12. (b) The\nCourt declines the Counties’ request to abandon Lemon ’s\npurpose test. Their assertions that true “purpose” is unknowable,\nand its search merely an excuse for courts to act selectively and\nunpredictably in picking out evidence of subjective intent, are as\nseismic as they are unconvincing. Examination of purpose is a\nstaple of statutory interpretation for every American appellate\ncourt, e.g., General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581 , 600, and\ngovernmental purpose is a key element of a good deal of\nconstitutional doctrine, e.g. , Washington v. Davis, 426\nU. S. 229 . Scrutinizing purpose makes practical sense in\nEstablishment Clause analysis, where an understanding of official\nobjective emerges from readily discoverable fact set forth in a\nstatute’s text, legislative history, and implementation or\ncomparable official act. Wallace v. Jaffree, 472\nU. S., at 73–74. Nor is there any indication that the purpose\nenquiry is rigged in practice to finding a religious purpose\ndominant every time a case is filed. Pp. 12–15. (c) The\nCourt also avoids the Counties’ alternative tack of trivializing\nthe purpose enquiry. They would read the Court’s cases as if the\nenquiry were so naive that any transparent claim to secularity\nwould satisfy it, and they would cut context out of the enquiry, to\nthe point of ignoring history, no matter what bearing it actually\nhad on the significance of current circumstances. There is no\nprecedent for these arguments, or reason supporting them.\nPp. 15–19. (1) A\nlegislature’s stated reasons will generally warrant the deference\nowed in the first instance to such official claims, but Lemon requires the secular purpose to be genuine, not a\nsham, and not merely secondary to a religious objective, see, e.g., Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe , 530 U.\nS. 290 , 308. In those unusual cases where the claim was an\napparent sham, or the secular purpose secondary, the unsurprising\nresults have been findings of no adequate secular object, as\nagainst a predominantly religious one. See , e.g., Stone,\nsupra , at 41. Pp. 15–17. (2) The\nCounties’ argument that purpose in a case like this should be\ninferred only from the latest in a series of governmental actions,\nhowever close they may all be in time and subject, bucks common\nsense. Reasonable observers have reasonable memories, and the\nCourt’s precedents sensibly forbid an observer “to turn a blind eye\nto the context in which [the] policy arose.” Santa Fe,\nsupra , at 315. Pp. 17–19. 2. Evaluation of the\nCounties’ claim of secular purpose for the ultimate displays may\ntake their evolution into account. The development of the\npresentation should be considered in determining its purpose.\nPp. 19–26. (a) Stone is\nthe Court’s initial benchmark as its only case dealing with the\nconstitutionality of displaying the Commandments. It recognized\nthat the Commandments are an “instrument of religion” and that, at\nleast on the facts before the Court, their text’s display could\npresumptively be understood as meant to advance religion: although\nstate law specifically required their posting in classrooms, their\nisolated exhibition did not allow even for an argument that secular\neducation explained their being there. 449 U. S., at 41, n. 3.\nBut Stone did not purport to decide the constitutionality\nof every possible way the government might set out the\nCommandments, and under the Establishment Clause detail is key, County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union,\nGreater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573 , 595.\nHence, the Court looks to the record showing the progression\nleading up to the Commandments’ third display, beginning with the\nfirst. Pp. 19–20. (b) There\nare two obvious similarities between the display Stone rejected and the first one here: both set out the Commandments’\ntext as distinct from any traditionally symbolic representation\nlike blank tablets, and each stood alone, not as part of an\narguably secular display. Stone stressed the significance\nof integrating the Commandments into a secular scheme to forestall\nthe broadcast of an otherwise clearly religious message, 449 U. S.,\nat 42, and for good reason, the Commandments being a central point\nof reference in the religious and moral history of Jews and\nChristians. They proclaim the existence of a monotheistic god (no\nother gods), regulate details of religious obligation (no graven\nimages, sabbath breaking, or vain oath swearing), and unmistakably\nrest even the universally accepted prohibitions (as against murder,\ntheft, etc.) on the sanction of the divinity proclaimed at the\ntext’s beginning. Displaying that text is thus different from\nsymbolic representation, like tablets with 10 roman numerals, which\ncould be seen as alluding to a general notion of law, not a\nsectarian conception of faith. Where the text is set\nout, the insistence of the religious message is hard to avoid in\nthe absence of a context plausibly suggesting a message going\nbeyond an excuse to promote the religious point of view. The\ndisplay in Stone had no such context, and the Counties’\nsolo exhibit here did nothing more to counter the sectarian\nimplication than the Stone postings. The reasonable\nobserver could only think that the Counties meant to emphasize and\ncelebrate the Commandments’ religious message.\nPp. 20–21. (c) The Counties’\nsecond display, unlike the first, did not hang the Commandments in\nisolation, but included the statement of the government’s purpose\nexpressly set out in the county resolutions, and underscored it by\njuxtaposing the Commandments to other documents whose references to\nGod were highlighted as their sole common element. The display’s\nunstinting focus was on religious passages, showing that the\nCounties posted the Commandments precisely because of their\nsectarian content. That demonstration of the government’s objective\nwas enhanced by serial religious references and the accompanying\nresolutions’ claim about the embodiment of ethics in Christ.\nTogether, the display and resolution presented an indisputable, and\nundisputed, showing of an impermissible purpose.\nPp. 21–22. (d) The lower courts’\nconclusion that no legitimizing secular purpose prompted the\nCounties’ third display, the “Foundations of American Law and\nGovernment” exhibit, is amply justified. That display placed the\nCommandments in the company of other documents the Counties deemed\nespecially significant in the historical foundation of American\ngovernment. In trying to persuade the District Court to lift the\npreliminary injunction, the Counties cited several new purposes for\nthe third version, including a desire to educate County citizens as\nto the significance of the documents displayed. The Counties’\nclaims, however, persuaded neither that court, which was intimately\nfamiliar with this litigation’s details, nor the Sixth Circuit.\nWhere both lower courts were unable to discern an arguably valid\nsecular purpose, this Court normally should hesitate to find one. Edwards v. Aguillard , 482 U. S. 578 , 594. The\nCounties’ new statements of purpose were presented only as a\nlitigating position, there being no further authorizing resolutions\nby the Counties’ governing boards. And although repeal of the\nearlier county authorizations would not have erased them from the\nrecord of evidence bearing on current purpose, the extraordinary\nresolutions for the second displays passed just months earlier were\nnot repealed or otherwise repudiated. Indeed, the sectarian spirit\nof the resolutions found enhanced expression in the third display,\nwhich quoted more of the Commandment’s purely religious language\nthan the first two displays had done. No reasonable observer,\ntherefore, could accept the claim that the Counties had cast off\nthe objective so unmistakable in the earlier displays. Nor did the\nselection of posted material suggest a clear theme that might\nprevail over evidence of the continuing religious object. For\nexample, it is at least odd in a collection of documents said to be\n“foundational” to include a patriotic anthem, but to omit the\nFourteenth Amendment, the most significant structural provision\nadopted since the original framing. An observer would probably\nsuspect the Counties of reaching for any way to keep a religious\ndocument on the walls of courthouses constitutionally required to\nembody religious neutrality. Pp. 22–25. (e) In holding that\nthe preliminary injunction was adequately supported by evidence\nthat the Counties’ purpose had not changed at the third stage, the\nCourt does not decide that the Counties’ past actions forever taint\nany effort on their part to deal with the subject matter. The Court\nholds only that purpose is to be taken seriously under the\nEstablishment Clause and is to be understood in light of context.\nDistrict courts are fully capable of adjusting preliminary relief\nto take account of genuine changes in constitutionally significant\nconditions. Nor does the Court hold that a sacred text can never be\nintegrated constitutionally into a governmental display on law or\nhistory. Its own courtroom frieze depicts Moses holding tablets\nexhibiting a portion of the secularly phrased Commandments; in the\ncompany of 17 other lawgivers, most of them secular figures, there\nis no risk that Moses would strike an observer as evidence that the\nNational Government was violating religious neutrality. P.\n26. 354 F. 3d 438,\naffirmed. Souter,\nJ., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens, O’Connor,\nGinsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. O’Connor, J., filed a concurring\nopinion. Scalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which\nRehnquist, C. J., and Thomas, J., joined, and in which\nKennedy, J., joined as to Parts II and III. OPINION OF THE COURT MCCREARY COUNTY V. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIESUNION OF KY. 545 U. S. ____ (2005) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 03-1693 McCREARY COUNTY, KENTUCKY, et al., PETI-\nTIONERS v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF KENTUCKY\net al. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the sixth circuit [June 27, 2005] Justice Souter delivered the\nopinion of the Court. Executives of two counties posted\na version of the Ten Commandments on the walls of their\ncourthouses. After suits were filed charging violations of the\nEstablishment Clause, the legislative body of each county adopted a\nresolution calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that\nthe Commandments are Kentucky’s “precedent legal code,”\nDef. Exh. 1 in Memorandum in Support of Defendants’ Motion to\nDismiss in Civ. A. No. 99–507, p. 1 (ED Ky.) (hereinafter Def.\nExh. 1). The result in each instance was a modified display of the\nCommandments surrounded by texts containing religious references as\ntheir sole common element. After changing counsel, the counties\nrevised the exhibits again by eliminating some documents, expanding the text set out in another, and adding\nsome new ones. The issues are whether\na determination of the counties’ purpose is a sound basis for\nruling on the Establishment Clause complaints, and whether\nevaluation of the counties’ claim of secular purpose for the\nultimate displays may take their evolution into account. We hold\nthat the counties’ manifest objective may be dispositive of the\nconstitutional enquiry, and that the development of the\npresentation should be considered when determining its\npurpose. I In the\nsummer of 1999, petitioners McCreary County and Pulaski County,\nKentucky (hereinafter Counties), put up in their respective\ncourthouses large, gold-framed copies of an abridged text of the\nKing James version of the Ten Commandments, including a citation to\nthe Book of Exodus.[ Footnote 1 ]\nIn McCreary County, the placement of the Commandments responded to\nan order of the county legislative body requiring “the display [to]\nbe posted in ‘a very high traffic area’ of the courthouse.” 96\nF. Supp. 2d 679, 684 (ED Ky. 2000). In Pulaski County, amidst\nreported controversy over the propriety of the display, the\nCommandments were hung in a ceremony presided over by the county\nJudge-Executive, who called them “good rules to live by” and who\nrecounted the story of an astronaut who became convinced “there\nmust be a divine God” after viewing the Earth from the moon.\nDodson, Commonwealth Journal, Jul. 25, 1999, p. A1, col. 2, in\nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary\nInjunction in Civ. A. No. 99–509 (ED Ky.) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The Judge-Executive was accompanied by the pastor of his\nchurch, who called the Commandments “a creed of ethics” and told\nthe press after the ceremony that displaying the Commandments was\n“one of the greatest things the judge could have done to close out\nthe millennium.” Id., at A2, col. 3 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In both counties, this was the version of the\nCommandments posted: “Thou shalt have no other\ngods before me. “Thou shalt not make unto thee any\ngraven images. “Thou shalt not take the name of the\nLord thy God in vain. “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it\nholy. “Honor thy father and thy\nmother. “Thou shalt not kill. “Thou shalt not commit\nadultery. “Thou shalt not steal. “Thou shalt not bear false\nwitness. “Thou shalt not covet. “Exodus 20:3–17.”[ Footnote 2 ]    Def. Exh. 9 in\nMemorandum in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss in Civ. A.\nNo. 99–507 (ED Ky.) (hereinafter Def. Exh. 9). In each county, the hallway\ndisplay was “readily visible to … county citizens who use the\ncourthouse to conduct their civic business, to obtain or renew\ndriver’s licenses and permits, to register cars, to pay local\ntaxes, and to register to vote.” 96 F. Supp. 2d., at 684; American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky v. Pulaski\nCounty, Kentucky, 96 F. Supp. 2d 691, 695 (ED Ky.\n2000). In November 1999,\nrespondents American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky et al.\nsued the Counties in Federal District Court under Rev. Stat. §1979,\n42 U. S. C. §1983, and sought a preliminary injunction against\nmaintaining the displays, which the ACLU charged were violations of\nthe prohibition of religious establishment included in the First\nAmendment of the Constitution.[ Footnote 3 ] Within a month, and before the District Court\nhad responded to the request for injunction, the legislative body\nof each County authorized a second, expanded display, by nearly\nidentical resolutions reciting that the Ten Commandments are “the\nprecedent legal code upon which the civil and criminal codes of …\nKentucky are founded,” and stating several grounds for taking that\nposition: that “the Ten Commandments are codified in Kentucky’s\ncivil and criminal laws”; that the Kentucky House of\nRepresentatives had in 1993 “voted unanimously … to adjourn … ‘in\nremembrance and honor of Jesus Christ, the Prince of\nEthics’ ”; that the “County Judge and … magistrates agree with\nthe arguments set out by Judge [Roy] Moore” in defense of his\n“display [of] the Ten Commandments in his courtroom”; and that the\n“Founding Father[s] [had an] explicit understanding of the duty of\nelected officials to publicly acknowledge God as the source of\nAmerica’s strength and direction.” Def. Exh. 1, at 1–3,\n6. As directed by the\nresolutions, the Counties expanded the displays of the Ten\nCommandments in their locations, presumably along with copies of\nthe resolution, which instructed that it, too, be posted, id., at 9. In addition to the first display’s large framed\ncopy of the edited King James version of the Commandments,[ Footnote 4 ] the second included eight\nother documents in smaller frames, each either having a religious\ntheme or excerpted to highlight a religious element. The documents\nwere the “endowed by their Creator” passage from the Declaration of\nIndependence; the Preamble to the Constitution of Kentucky; the\nnational motto, “In God We Trust”; a page from the Congressional\nRecord of February 2, 1983, proclaiming the Year of the Bible and\nincluding a statement of the Ten Commandments; a proclamation by\nPresident Abraham Lincoln designating April 30, 1863, a National\nDay of Prayer and Humiliation; an excerpt from President Lincoln’s\n“Reply to Loyal Colored People of Baltimore upon Presentation of a\nBible,” reading that “[t]he Bible is the best gift God has ever\ngiven to man”; a proclamation by President Reagan marking 1983 the\nYear of the Bible; and the Mayflower Compact. 96 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 684; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 695–696. After argument, the\nDistrict Court entered a preliminary injunction on May 5, 2000,\nordering that the “display … be removed from [each] County\nCourthouse IMMEDIATELY” and that no county official “erect or cause\nto be erected similar displays.” 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 691; 96\nF. Supp. 2d, at 702–703. The court’s analysis of the situation\nfollowed the three-part formulation first stated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971). As\nto governmental purpose, it concluded that the original display\n“lack[ed] any secular purpose” because the Commandments “are a\ndistinctly religious document, believed by many Christians and Jews\nto be the direct and revealed word of God.” 96 F. Supp. 2d, at\n686; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 698. Although the Counties had\nmaintained that the original display was meant to be educational,\n“[t]he narrow scope of the display—a single religious text\nunaccompanied by any interpretation explaining its role as a\nfoundational document—can hardly be said to present meaningfully\nthe story of this country’s religious traditions.” 96 F. Supp.\n2d, at 686–687; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 698. The court found that\nthe second version also “clearly lack[ed] a secular purpose”\nbecause the “Count[ies] narrowly tailored [their] selection of\nfoundational documents to incorporate only those with specific\nreferences to Christianity.”[ Footnote 5 ] 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 687; 96 F. Supp.\n2d, at 699. The Counties filed a\nnotice of appeal from the preliminary injunction but voluntarily\ndismissed it after hiring new lawyers. They then installed another\ndisplay in each courthouse, the third within a year. No new\nresolution authorized this one, nor did the Counties repeal the\nresolutions that preceded the second. The posting consists of nine\nframed documents of equal size, one of them setting out the Ten\nCommandments explicitly identified as the “King James Version” at\nExodus 20:3–17, 145 F. Supp. 2d 845, 847 (ED Ky. 2001) and\nquoted at greater length than before: “Thou shalt have no other\ngods before me. “Thou shalt not make unto thee any\ngraven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above,\nor that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water underneath\nthe earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them:\nfor I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of\nthe fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation\nof them that hate me. “Thou shalt not take the name of the\nLORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that\ntaketh his name in vain. “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it\nholy. “Honour thy father and thy mother: that\nthy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth\nthee. “Thou shalt not kill. “Thou shalt not commit\nadultery. “Thou shalt not steal. “Thou shalt not bear false witness\nagainst thy neighbour. “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s\nhouse, thou shalt not covet th[y] neighbor’s wife, nor his\nmanservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor\nanything that is th[y] neighbour’s.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n189a. Assembled with the\nCommandments are framed copies of the Magna Carta, the Declaration\nof Independence, the Bill of Rights, the lyrics of the Star\nSpangled Banner, the Mayflower Compact, the National Motto, the\nPreamble to the Kentucky Constitution, and a picture of Lady\nJustice. The collection is entitled “The Foundations of American\nLaw and Government Display” and each document comes with a\nstatement about its historical and legal significance. The comment\non the Ten Commandments reads: “The Ten Commandments have\nprofoundly influenced the formation of Western legal thought and\nthe formation of our country. That influence is clearly seen in the\nDeclaration of Independence, which declared that ‘We hold these\ntruths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that\nthey are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,\nthat among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.’\nThe Ten Commandments provide the moral background of the\nDeclaration of Independence and the foundation of our legal\ntradition.” Id., at 180a. The ACLU\nmoved to supplement the preliminary injunction to enjoin the\nCounties’ third display,[ Footnote\n6 ] and the Counties responded with several explanations for the\nnew version, including desires “to demonstrate that the Ten\nCommandments were part of the foundation of American Law and\nGovernment” and “to educate the citizens of the county regarding\nsome of the documents that played a significant role in the\nfoundation of our system of law and government.” 145 F. Supp.\n2d, at 848 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court, however,\ntook the objective of proclaiming the Commandments’ foundational\nvalue as “a religious, rather than secular, purpose” under Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39 (1980) (per\ncuriam), 145 F. Supp. 2d, at 849, and found that the\nassertion that the Counties’ broader educational goals are secular\n“crumble[s] … upon an examination of the history of this\nlitigation,” Ibid. In light of the Counties’ decision to\npost the Commandments by themselves in the first instance, contrary\nto Stone , and later to “accentuat[e]” the religious\nobjective by surrounding the Commandments with “specific references\nto Christianity,” the District Court understood the Counties’\n“clear” purpose as being to post the Commandments, not to\neducate.[ Footnote 7 ] 145\nF. Supp. 2d, at 849–850 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). As requested, the\ntrial court supplemented the injunction, and a divided panel of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. The Circuit\nmajority stressed that under Stone , displaying the\nCommandments bespeaks a religious object unless they are integrated\nwith other material so as to carry “a secular message,” 354\nF. 3d 438, 449 (2003). The majority judges saw no integration\nhere because of a “lack of a demonstrated analytical or historical\nconnection [between the Commandments and] the other documents.” Id., at 451. They noted in particular that the Counties\noffered no support for their claim that the Ten Commandments\n“provide[d] the moral backdrop” to the Declaration of Independence\nor otherwise “profoundly influenced” it. Ibid. (Internal\nquotation marks omitted). The majority found that the Counties’\npurpose was religious, not educational, given the nature of the\nCommandments as “an active symbol of religion [stating] ‘the\nreligious duties of believers,’ ” Id., at 455. The\njudges in the majority understood the identical displays to\nemphasize “a single religious influence, with no mention of any\nother religious or secular influences,” id., at 454, and\nthey took the very history of the litigation as evidence of the\nCounties’ religious objective, id., at\n457. Judge Ryan dissented\non the basis of wide recognition that religion, and the Ten\nCommandments in particular, have played a foundational part in the\nevolution of American law and government; he saw no reason to\ngainsay the Counties’ claim of secular purposes. Id., at\n472–473. The dissent denied that the prior displays should have any\nbearing on the constitutionality of the current one: a “history of\nunconstitutional displays can[not] be used as a sword to strike\ndown an otherwise constitutional display.”[ Footnote 8 ] Id., at 478. We granted certiorari,\n543 U. S. ___ (2004), and now affirm. II Twenty-five years ago in a case prompted by\nposting the Ten Commandments in Kentucky’s public schools, this\nCourt recognized that the Commandments “are undeniably a sacred\ntext in the Jewish and Christian faiths” and held that their\ndisplay in public classrooms violated the First Amendment’s bar\nagainst establishment of religion. Stone, 449 U. S., at\n41. Stone found a predominantly religious purpose in the\ngovernment’s posting of the Commandments, given their prominence as\n“ ‘an instrument of religion,’ ” id., at 41, n.\n3 (quoting School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 , 224\n(1963)). The Counties ask for a different approach here by arguing\nthat official purpose is unknowable and the search for it\ninherently vain. In the alternative, the Counties would avoid the\nDistrict Court’s conclusion by having us limit the scope of the\npurpose enquiry so severely that any trivial rationalization would\nsuffice, under a standard oblivious to the history of religious\ngovernment action like the progression of exhibits in this\ncase. A Ever\nsince Lemon v. Kurtzman summarized the three\nfamiliar considerations for evaluating Establishment Clause claims,\nlooking to whether government action has “a secular legislative\npurpose” has been a common, albeit seldom dispositive, element of\nour cases. 403 U. S., at 612. Though we have found government\naction motivated by an illegitimate purpose only four times since Lemon ,[ Footnote 9 ] and\n“the secular purpose requirement alone may rarely be\ndeterminative … , it nevertheless serves an important\nfunction.”[ Footnote 10 ] Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38 , 75 (1985)\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment). The\ntouchstone for our analysis is the principle that the “First\nAmendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and\nreligion, and between religion and nonreligion.” Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97 , 104 (1968); Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S.\n1 , 15–16 (1947); Wallace v. Jaffree, supra , at 53. When the government acts with the ostensible\nand predominant purpose of advancing religion, it violates that central Establishment Clause value of official\nreligious neutrality, there being no neutrality when the\ngovernment’s ostensible object is to take sides. Corporation of\nPresiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter&nbhyph;day\nSaints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327 , 335\n(1987) (“ Lemon ’s ‘purpose’ requirement aims at preventing\n[government] from abandoning neutrality and acting with the intent\nof promoting a particular point of view in religious matters”).\nManifesting a purpose to favor one faith over another, or adherence\nto religion generally, clashes with the “understanding, reached …\nafter decades of religious war, that liberty and social stability\ndemand a religious tolerance that respects the religious views of\nall citizens … .” Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639 ,\n718 (2002) (Breyer, J., dissenting). By showing a purpose to\nfavor religion, the government “sends the … message to …\nnonadherents ‘that they are outsiders, not full members of the\npolitical community, and an accompanying message to adherents that\nthey are insiders, favored members… .’ ” Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S. 290 , 309–310 (2000) (quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668 , 688\n(1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring)). Indeed,\nthe purpose apparent from government action can have an impact more\nsignificant than the result expressly decreed: when the government\nmaintains Sunday closing laws, it advances religion only minimally\nbecause many working people would take the day as one of rest\nregardless, but if the government justified its decision with a\nstated desire for all Americans to honor Christ, the divisive\nthrust of the official action would be inescapable. This is the\nteaching of McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420 (1961), which upheld\nSunday closing statutes on practical, secular grounds after finding\nthat the government had forsaken the religious purposes behind\ncenturies-old predecessor laws. Id., at\n449–451. B Despite the intuitive importance of official purpose to the realization of Establishment Clause\nvalues, the Counties ask us to abandon Lemon ’s purpose\ntest, or at least to truncate any enquiry into purpose here. Their\nfirst argument is that the very consideration of purpose is\ndeceptive: according to them, true “purpose” is unknowable, and its\nsearch merely an excuse for courts to act selectively and\nunpredictably in picking out evidence of subjective intent. The\nassertions are as seismic as they are\nunconvincing. Examination of purpose is a staple of\nstatutory interpretation that makes up the daily fare of every\nappellate court in the country, e.g., General Dynamics\nLand Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581 , 600\n(2004) (interpreting statute in light of its “tex",

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES McCREARY COUNTY, KENTUCKY, et al. v .\nAMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF KENTUCKY et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the sixth circuit No. 03–1693.Argued March 2, 2005—Decided June 27,\n2005 After petitioners, two Kentucky Counties, each\nposted large, readily visible copies of the Ten Commandments in\ntheir courthouses, respondents, the American Civil Liberties Union\n(ACLU) et al., sued under 42 U. S. C. §1983 to enjoin the\ndisplays on the ground that they violated the First Amendment’s\nEstablishment Clause. The Counties then adopted nearly identical\nresolutions calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that\nthe Commandments are Kentucky’s “precedent legal code.”\nThe resolutions noted several grounds for taking that position,\nincluding the state legislature’s acknowledgment of Christ as the\n“Prince of Ethics.” The displays around the Commandments were\nmodified to include eight smaller, historical documents containing\nreligious references as their sole common element, e.g., the Declaration of Independence’s “endowed by their Creator”\npassage. Entering a preliminary injunction, the District Court\nfollowed the Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 , test to\nfind, inter alia , that the original display lacked any\nsecular purpose because the Commandments are a distinctly religious\ndocument, and that the second version lacked such a purpose because\nthe Counties narrowly tailored their selection of foundational\ndocuments to those specifically referring to Christianity. After\nchanging counsel, the Counties revised the exhibits again. No new\nresolution authorized the new exhibits, nor did the Counties repeal\nthe resolutions that preceded the second one. The new posting,\nentitled “The Foundations of American Law and Government Display,”\nconsists of nine framed documents of equal size. One sets out the\nCommandments explicitly identified as the “King James Version,”\nquotes them at greater length, and explains that they have\nprofoundly influenced the formation of Western legal thought and\nthis Nation. With the Commandments are framed copies of, e.g., the Star Spangled Banner’s lyrics and the\nDeclaration of Independence, accompanied by statements about their\nhistorical and legal significance. On the ACLU’s motion, the\nDistrict Court included this third display in the injunction\ndespite the Counties’ professed intent to show that the\nCommandments were part of the foundation of American Law and\nGovernment and to educate County citizens as to the documents. The\ncourt took proclaiming the Commandments’ foundational value as a\nreligious, rather than secular, purpose under Stone v. Graham, 449\nU. S. 39 , and found that the Counties’ asserted educational\ngoals crumbled upon an examination of this litigation’s history.\nAffirming, the Sixth Circuit stressed that, under Stone ,\ndisplaying the Commandments bespeaks a religious object unless they\nare integrated with a secular message. The court saw no integration\nhere because of a lack of a demonstrated analytical or historical\nconnection between the Commandments and the other\ndocuments. Held: 1. A\ndetermination of the Counties’ purpose is a sound basis for ruling\non the Establishment Clause complaints. The Counties’ objective may\nbe dispositive of the constitutional enquiry.\nPp. 10–19. (a) Lemon ’s\n“secular legislative purpose” enquiry, 403 U. S., at 612, has been\na common, albeit seldom dispositive, element of this Court’s cases, Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38 , 75. When\nthe government acts with the ostensible and predominant purpose of\nadvancing religion, it violates the central Establishment Clause\nvalue of official religious neutrality, there being no neutrality\nwhen the government’s ostensible object is to take sides. Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter&nbhyph;day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327 , 335. A\npurpose to favor one faith over another, or adherence to religion\ngenerally, clashes with the “understanding … that liberty and\nsocial stability demand a … tolerance that respects the religious\nviews of all citizens.” Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639 ,\n718. Pp. 11–12. (b) The\nCourt declines the Counties’ request to abandon Lemon ’s\npurpose test. Their assertions that true “purpose” is unknowable,\nand its search merely an excuse for courts to act selectively and\nunpredictably in picking out evidence of subjective intent, are as\nseismic as they are unconvincing. Examination of purpose is a\nstaple of statutory interpretation for every American appellate\ncourt, e.g., General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581 , 600, and\ngovernmental purpose is a key element of a good deal of\nconstitutional doctrine, e.g. , Washington v. Davis, 426\nU. S. 229 . Scrutinizing purpose makes practical sense in\nEstablishment Clause analysis, where an understanding of official\nobjective emerges from readily discoverable fact set forth in a\nstatute’s text, legislative history, and implementation or\ncomparable official act. Wallace v. Jaffree, 472\nU. S., at 73–74. Nor is there any indication that the purpose\nenquiry is rigged in practice to finding a religious purpose\ndominant every time a case is filed. Pp. 12–15. (c) The\nCourt also avoids the Counties’ alternative tack of trivializing\nthe purpose enquiry. They would read the Court’s cases as if the\nenquiry were so naive that any transparent claim to secularity\nwould satisfy it, and they would cut context out of the enquiry, to\nthe point of ignoring history, no matter what bearing it actually\nhad on the significance of current circumstances. There is no\nprecedent for these arguments, or reason supporting them.\nPp. 15–19. (1) A\nlegislature’s stated reasons will generally warrant the deference\nowed in the first instance to such official claims, but Lemon requires the secular purpose to be genuine, not a\nsham, and not merely secondary to a religious objective, see, e.g., Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe , 530 U.\nS. 290 , 308. In those unusual cases where the claim was an\napparent sham, or the secular purpose secondary, the unsurprising\nresults have been findings of no adequate secular object, as\nagainst a predominantly religious one. See , e.g., Stone,\nsupra , at 41. Pp. 15–17. (2) The\nCounties’ argument that purpose in a case like this should be\ninferred only from the latest in a series of governmental actions,\nhowever close they may all be in time and subject, bucks common\nsense. Reasonable observers have reasonable memories, and the\nCourt’s precedents sensibly forbid an observer “to turn a blind eye\nto the context in which [the] policy arose.” Santa Fe,\nsupra , at 315. Pp. 17–19. 2. Evaluation of the\nCounties’ claim of secular purpose for the ultimate displays may\ntake their evolution into account. The development of the\npresentation should be considered in determining its purpose.\nPp. 19–26. (a) Stone is\nthe Court’s initial benchmark as its only case dealing with the\nconstitutionality of displaying the Commandments. It recognized\nthat the Commandments are an “instrument of religion” and that, at\nleast on the facts before the Court, their text’s display could\npresumptively be understood as meant to advance religion: although\nstate law specifically required their posting in classrooms, their\nisolated exhibition did not allow even for an argument that secular\neducation explained their being there. 449 U. S., at 41, n. 3.\nBut Stone did not purport to decide the constitutionality\nof every possible way the government might set out the\nCommandments, and under the Establishment Clause detail is key, County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union,\nGreater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573 , 595.\nHence, the Court looks to the record showing the progression\nleading up to the Commandments’ third display, beginning with the\nfirst. Pp. 19–20. (b) There\nare two obvious similarities between the display Stone rejected and the first one here: both set out the Commandments’\ntext as distinct from any traditionally symbolic representation\nlike blank tablets, and each stood alone, not as part of an\narguably secular display. Stone stressed the significance\nof integrating the Commandments into a secular scheme to forestall\nthe broadcast of an otherwise clearly religious message, 449 U. S.,\nat 42, and for good reason, the Commandments being a central point\nof reference in the religious and moral history of Jews and\nChristians. They proclaim the existence of a monotheistic god (no\nother gods), regulate details of religious obligation (no graven\nimages, sabbath breaking, or vain oath swearing), and unmistakably\nrest even the universally accepted prohibitions (as against murder,\ntheft, etc.) on the sanction of the divinity proclaimed at the\ntext’s beginning. Displaying that text is thus different from\nsymbolic representation, like tablets with 10 roman numerals, which\ncould be seen as alluding to a general notion of law, not a\nsectarian conception of faith. Where the text is set\nout, the insistence of the religious message is hard to avoid in\nthe absence of a context plausibly suggesting a message going\nbeyond an excuse to promote the religious point of view. The\ndisplay in Stone had no such context, and the Counties’\nsolo exhibit here did nothing more to counter the sectarian\nimplication than the Stone postings. The reasonable\nobserver could only think that the Counties meant to emphasize and\ncelebrate the Commandments’ religious message.\nPp. 20–21. (c) The Counties’\nsecond display, unlike the first, did not hang the Commandments in\nisolation, but included the statement of the government’s purpose\nexpressly set out in the county resolutions, and underscored it by\njuxtaposing the Commandments to other documents whose references to\nGod were highlighted as their sole common element. The display’s\nunstinting focus was on religious passages, showing that the\nCounties posted the Commandments precisely because of their\nsectarian content. That demonstration of the government’s objective\nwas enhanced by serial religious references and the accompanying\nresolutions’ claim about the embodiment of ethics in Christ.\nTogether, the display and resolution presented an indisputable, and\nundisputed, showing of an impermissible purpose.\nPp. 21–22. (d) The lower courts’\nconclusion that no legitimizing secular purpose prompted the\nCounties’ third display, the “Foundations of American Law and\nGovernment” exhibit, is amply justified. That display placed the\nCommandments in the company of other documents the Counties deemed\nespecially significant in the historical foundation of American\ngovernment. In trying to persuade the District Court to lift the\npreliminary injunction, the Counties cited several new purposes for\nthe third version, including a desire to educate County citizens as\nto the significance of the documents displayed. The Counties’\nclaims, however, persuaded neither that court, which was intimately\nfamiliar with this litigation’s details, nor the Sixth Circuit.\nWhere both lower courts were unable to discern an arguably valid\nsecular purpose, this Court normally should hesitate to find one. Edwards v. Aguillard , 482 U. S. 578 , 594. The\nCounties’ new statements of purpose were presented only as a\nlitigating position, there being no further authorizing resolutions\nby the Counties’ governing boards. And although repeal of the\nearlier county authorizations would not have erased them from the\nrecord of evidence bearing on current purpose, the extraordinary\nresolutions for the second displays passed just months earlier were\nnot repealed or otherwise repudiated. Indeed, the sectarian spirit\nof the resolutions found enhanced expression in the third display,\nwhich quoted more of the Commandment’s purely religious language\nthan the first two displays had done. No reasonable observer,\ntherefore, could accept the claim that the Counties had cast off\nthe objective so unmistakable in the earlier displays. Nor did the\nselection of posted material suggest a clear theme that might\nprevail over evidence of the continuing religious object. For\nexample, it is at least odd in a collection of documents said to be\n“foundational” to include a patriotic anthem, but to omit the\nFourteenth Amendment, the most significant structural provision\nadopted since the original framing. An observer would probably\nsuspect the Counties of reaching for any way to keep a religious\ndocument on the walls of courthouses constitutionally required to\nembody religious neutrality. Pp. 22–25. (e) In holding that\nthe preliminary injunction was adequately supported by evidence\nthat the Counties’ purpose had not changed at the third stage, the\nCourt does not decide that the Counties’ past actions forever taint\nany effort on their part to deal with the subject matter. The Court\nholds only that purpose is to be taken seriously under the\nEstablishment Clause and is to be understood in light of context.\nDistrict courts are fully capable of adjusting preliminary relief\nto take account of genuine changes in constitutionally significant\nconditions. Nor does the Court hold that a sacred text can never be\nintegrated constitutionally into a governmental display on law or\nhistory. Its own courtroom frieze depicts Moses holding tablets\nexhibiting a portion of the secularly phrased Commandments; in the\ncompany of 17 other lawgivers, most of them secular figures, there\nis no risk that Moses would strike an observer as evidence that the\nNational Government was violating religious neutrality. P.\n26. 354 F. 3d 438,\naffirmed. Souter,\nJ., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Stevens, O’Connor,\nGinsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. O’Connor, J., filed a concurring\nopinion. Scalia, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which\nRehnquist, C. J., and Thomas, J., joined, and in which\nKennedy, J., joined as to Parts II and III. OPINION OF THE COURT MCCREARY COUNTY V. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIESUNION OF KY. 545 U. S. ____ (2005) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 03-1693 McCREARY COUNTY, KENTUCKY, et al., PETI-\nTIONERS v. AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF KENTUCKY\net al. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the sixth circuit [June 27, 2005] Justice Souter delivered the\nopinion of the Court. Executives of two counties posted\na version of the Ten Commandments on the walls of their\ncourthouses. After suits were filed charging violations of the\nEstablishment Clause, the legislative body of each county adopted a\nresolution calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that\nthe Commandments are Kentucky’s “precedent legal code,”\nDef. Exh. 1 in Memorandum in Support of Defendants’ Motion to\nDismiss in Civ. A. No. 99–507, p. 1 (ED Ky.) (hereinafter Def.\nExh. 1). The result in each instance was a modified display of the\nCommandments surrounded by texts containing religious references as\ntheir sole common element. After changing counsel, the counties\nrevised the exhibits again by eliminating some documents, expanding the text set out in another, and adding\nsome new ones. The issues are whether\na determination of the counties’ purpose is a sound basis for\nruling on the Establishment Clause complaints, and whether\nevaluation of the counties’ claim of secular purpose for the\nultimate displays may take their evolution into account. We hold\nthat the counties’ manifest objective may be dispositive of the\nconstitutional enquiry, and that the development of the\npresentation should be considered when determining its\npurpose. I In the\nsummer of 1999, petitioners McCreary County and Pulaski County,\nKentucky (hereinafter Counties), put up in their respective\ncourthouses large, gold-framed copies of an abridged text of the\nKing James version of the Ten Commandments, including a citation to\nthe Book of Exodus.[ Footnote 1 ]\nIn McCreary County, the placement of the Commandments responded to\nan order of the county legislative body requiring “the display [to]\nbe posted in ‘a very high traffic area’ of the courthouse.” 96\nF. Supp. 2d 679, 684 (ED Ky. 2000). In Pulaski County, amidst\nreported controversy over the propriety of the display, the\nCommandments were hung in a ceremony presided over by the county\nJudge-Executive, who called them “good rules to live by” and who\nrecounted the story of an astronaut who became convinced “there\nmust be a divine God” after viewing the Earth from the moon.\nDodson, Commonwealth Journal, Jul. 25, 1999, p. A1, col. 2, in\nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary\nInjunction in Civ. A. No. 99–509 (ED Ky.) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The Judge-Executive was accompanied by the pastor of his\nchurch, who called the Commandments “a creed of ethics” and told\nthe press after the ceremony that displaying the Commandments was\n“one of the greatest things the judge could have done to close out\nthe millennium.” Id., at A2, col. 3 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In both counties, this was the version of the\nCommandments posted: “Thou shalt have no other\ngods before me. “Thou shalt not make unto thee any\ngraven images. “Thou shalt not take the name of the\nLord thy God in vain. “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it\nholy. “Honor thy father and thy\nmother. “Thou shalt not kill. “Thou shalt not commit\nadultery. “Thou shalt not steal. “Thou shalt not bear false\nwitness. “Thou shalt not covet. “Exodus 20:3–17.”[ Footnote 2 ]    Def. Exh. 9 in\nMemorandum in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss in Civ. A.\nNo. 99–507 (ED Ky.) (hereinafter Def. Exh. 9). In each county, the hallway\ndisplay was “readily visible to … county citizens who use the\ncourthouse to conduct their civic business, to obtain or renew\ndriver’s licenses and permits, to register cars, to pay local\ntaxes, and to register to vote.” 96 F. Supp. 2d., at 684; American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky v. Pulaski\nCounty, Kentucky, 96 F. Supp. 2d 691, 695 (ED Ky.\n2000). In November 1999,\nrespondents American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky et al.\nsued the Counties in Federal District Court under Rev. Stat. §1979,\n42 U. S. C. §1983, and sought a preliminary injunction against\nmaintaining the displays, which the ACLU charged were violations of\nthe prohibition of religious establishment included in the First\nAmendment of the Constitution.[ Footnote 3 ] Within a month, and before the District Court\nhad responded to the request for injunction, the legislative body\nof each County authorized a second, expanded display, by nearly\nidentical resolutions reciting that the Ten Commandments are “the\nprecedent legal code upon which the civil and criminal codes of …\nKentucky are founded,” and stating several grounds for taking that\nposition: that “the Ten Commandments are codified in Kentucky’s\ncivil and criminal laws”; that the Kentucky House of\nRepresentatives had in 1993 “voted unanimously … to adjourn … ‘in\nremembrance and honor of Jesus Christ, the Prince of\nEthics’ ”; that the “County Judge and … magistrates agree with\nthe arguments set out by Judge [Roy] Moore” in defense of his\n“display [of] the Ten Commandments in his courtroom”; and that the\n“Founding Father[s] [had an] explicit understanding of the duty of\nelected officials to publicly acknowledge God as the source of\nAmerica’s strength and direction.” Def. Exh. 1, at 1–3,\n6. As directed by the\nresolutions, the Counties expanded the displays of the Ten\nCommandments in their locations, presumably along with copies of\nthe resolution, which instructed that it, too, be posted, id., at 9. In addition to the first display’s large framed\ncopy of the edited King James version of the Commandments,[ Footnote 4 ] the second included eight\nother documents in smaller frames, each either having a religious\ntheme or excerpted to highlight a religious element. The documents\nwere the “endowed by their Creator” passage from the Declaration of\nIndependence; the Preamble to the Constitution of Kentucky; the\nnational motto, “In God We Trust”; a page from the Congressional\nRecord of February 2, 1983, proclaiming the Year of the Bible and\nincluding a statement of the Ten Commandments; a proclamation by\nPresident Abraham Lincoln designating April 30, 1863, a National\nDay of Prayer and Humiliation; an excerpt from President Lincoln’s\n“Reply to Loyal Colored People of Baltimore upon Presentation of a\nBible,” reading that “[t]he Bible is the best gift God has ever\ngiven to man”; a proclamation by President Reagan marking 1983 the\nYear of the Bible; and the Mayflower Compact. 96 F. Supp. 2d,\nat 684; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 695–696. After argument, the\nDistrict Court entered a preliminary injunction on May 5, 2000,\nordering that the “display … be removed from [each] County\nCourthouse IMMEDIATELY” and that no county official “erect or cause\nto be erected similar displays.” 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 691; 96\nF. Supp. 2d, at 702–703. The court’s analysis of the situation\nfollowed the three-part formulation first stated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971). As\nto governmental purpose, it concluded that the original display\n“lack[ed] any secular purpose” because the Commandments “are a\ndistinctly religious document, believed by many Christians and Jews\nto be the direct and revealed word of God.” 96 F. Supp. 2d, at\n686; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 698. Although the Counties had\nmaintained that the original display was meant to be educational,\n“[t]he narrow scope of the display—a single religious text\nunaccompanied by any interpretation explaining its role as a\nfoundational document—can hardly be said to present meaningfully\nthe story of this country’s religious traditions.” 96 F. Supp.\n2d, at 686–687; 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 698. The court found that\nthe second version also “clearly lack[ed] a secular purpose”\nbecause the “Count[ies] narrowly tailored [their] selection of\nfoundational documents to incorporate only those with specific\nreferences to Christianity.”[ Footnote 5 ] 96 F. Supp. 2d, at 687; 96 F. Supp.\n2d, at 699. The Counties filed a\nnotice of appeal from the preliminary injunction but voluntarily\ndismissed it after hiring new lawyers. They then installed another\ndisplay in each courthouse, the third within a year. No new\nresolution authorized this one, nor did the Counties repeal the\nresolutions that preceded the second. The posting consists of nine\nframed documents of equal size, one of them setting out the Ten\nCommandments explicitly identified as the “King James Version” at\nExodus 20:3–17, 145 F. Supp. 2d 845, 847 (ED Ky. 2001) and\nquoted at greater length than before: “Thou shalt have no other\ngods before me. “Thou shalt not make unto thee any\ngraven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above,\nor that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water underneath\nthe earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them:\nfor I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of\nthe fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation\nof them that hate me. “Thou shalt not take the name of the\nLORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that\ntaketh his name in vain. “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it\nholy. “Honour thy father and thy mother: that\nthy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth\nthee. “Thou shalt not kill. “Thou shalt not commit\nadultery. “Thou shalt not steal. “Thou shalt not bear false witness\nagainst thy neighbour. “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s\nhouse, thou shalt not covet th[y] neighbor’s wife, nor his\nmanservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor\nanything that is th[y] neighbour’s.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n189a. Assembled with the\nCommandments are framed copies of the Magna Carta, the Declaration\nof Independence, the Bill of Rights, the lyrics of the Star\nSpangled Banner, the Mayflower Compact, the National Motto, the\nPreamble to the Kentucky Constitution, and a picture of Lady\nJustice. The collection is entitled “The Foundations of American\nLaw and Government Display” and each document comes with a\nstatement about its historical and legal significance. The comment\non the Ten Commandments reads: “The Ten Commandments have\nprofoundly influenced the formation of Western legal thought and\nthe formation of our country. That influence is clearly seen in the\nDeclaration of Independence, which declared that ‘We hold these\ntruths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that\nthey are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,\nthat among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.’\nThe Ten Commandments provide the moral background of the\nDeclaration of Independence and the foundation of our legal\ntradition.” Id., at 180a. The ACLU\nmoved to supplement the preliminary injunction to enjoin the\nCounties’ third display,[ Footnote\n6 ] and the Counties responded with several explanations for the\nnew version, including desires “to demonstrate that the Ten\nCommandments were part of the foundation of American Law and\nGovernment” and “to educate the citizens of the county regarding\nsome of the documents that played a significant role in the\nfoundation of our system of law and government.” 145 F. Supp.\n2d, at 848 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court, however,\ntook the objective of proclaiming the Commandments’ foundational\nvalue as “a religious, rather than secular, purpose” under Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39 (1980) (per\ncuriam), 145 F. Supp. 2d, at 849, and found that the\nassertion that the Counties’ broader educational goals are secular\n“crumble[s] … upon an examination of the history of this\nlitigation,” Ibid. In light of the Counties’ decision to\npost the Commandments by themselves in the first instance, contrary\nto Stone , and later to “accentuat[e]” the religious\nobjective by surrounding the Commandments with “specific references\nto Christianity,” the District Court understood the Counties’\n“clear” purpose as being to post the Commandments, not to\neducate.[ Footnote 7 ] 145\nF. Supp. 2d, at 849–850 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). As requested, the\ntrial court supplemented the injunction, and a divided panel of the\nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. The Circuit\nmajority stressed that under Stone , displaying the\nCommandments bespeaks a religious object unless they are integrated\nwith other material so as to carry “a secular message,” 354\nF. 3d 438, 449 (2003). The majority judges saw no integration\nhere because of a “lack of a demonstrated analytical or historical\nconnection [between the Commandments and] the other documents.” Id., at 451. They noted in particular that the Counties\noffered no support for their claim that the Ten Commandments\n“provide[d] the moral backdrop” to the Declaration of Independence\nor otherwise “profoundly influenced” it. Ibid. (Internal\nquotation marks omitted). The majority found that the Counties’\npurpose was religious, not educational, given the nature of the\nCommandments as “an active symbol of religion [stating] ‘the\nreligious duties of believers,’ ” Id., at 455. The\njudges in the majority understood the identical displays to\nemphasize “a single religious influence, with no mention of any\nother religious or secular influences,” id., at 454, and\nthey took the very history of the litigation as evidence of the\nCounties’ religious objective, id., at\n457. Judge Ryan dissented\non the basis of wide recognition that religion, and the Ten\nCommandments in particular, have played a foundational part in the\nevolution of American law and government; he saw no reason to\ngainsay the Counties’ claim of secular purposes. Id., at\n472–473. The dissent denied that the prior displays should have any\nbearing on the constitutionality of the current one: a “history of\nunconstitutional displays can[not] be used as a sword to strike\ndown an otherwise constitutional display.”[ Footnote 8 ] Id., at 478. We granted certiorari,\n543 U. S. ___ (2004), and now affirm. II Twenty-five years ago in a case prompted by\nposting the Ten Commandments in Kentucky’s public schools, this\nCourt recognized that the Commandments “are undeniably a sacred\ntext in the Jewish and Christian faiths” and held that their\ndisplay in public classrooms violated the First Amendment’s bar\nagainst establishment of religion. Stone, 449 U. S., at\n41. Stone found a predominantly religious purpose in the\ngovernment’s posting of the Commandments, given their prominence as\n“ ‘an instrument of religion,’ ” id., at 41, n.\n3 (quoting School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 , 224\n(1963)). The Counties ask for a different approach here by arguing\nthat official purpose is unknowable and the search for it\ninherently vain. In the alternative, the Counties would avoid the\nDistrict Court’s conclusion by having us limit the scope of the\npurpose enquiry so severely that any trivial rationalization would\nsuffice, under a standard oblivious to the history of religious\ngovernment action like the progression of exhibits in this\ncase. A Ever\nsince Lemon v. Kurtzman summarized the three\nfamiliar considerations for evaluating Establishment Clause claims,\nlooking to whether government action has “a secular legislative\npurpose” has been a common, albeit seldom dispositive, element of\nour cases. 403 U. S., at 612. Though we have found government\naction motivated by an illegitimate purpose only four times since Lemon ,[ Footnote 9 ] and\n“the secular purpose requirement alone may rarely be\ndeterminative … , it nevertheless serves an important\nfunction.”[ Footnote 10 ] Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38 , 75 (1985)\n(O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment). The\ntouchstone for our analysis is the principle that the “First\nAmendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and\nreligion, and between religion and nonreligion.” Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97 , 104 (1968); Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S.\n1 , 15–16 (1947); Wallace v. Jaffree, supra , at 53. When the government acts with the ostensible\nand predominant purpose of advancing religion, it violates that central Establishment Clause value of official\nreligious neutrality, there being no neutrality when the\ngovernment’s ostensible object is to take sides. Corporation of\nPresiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter&nbhyph;day\nSaints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327 , 335\n(1987) (“ Lemon ’s ‘purpose’ requirement aims at preventing\n[government] from abandoning neutrality and acting with the intent\nof promoting a particular point of view in religious matters”).\nManifesting a purpose to favor one faith over another, or adherence\nto religion generally, clashes with the “understanding, reached …\nafter decades of religious war, that liberty and social stability\ndemand a religious tolerance that respects the religious views of\nall citizens … .” Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639 ,\n718 (2002) (Breyer, J., dissenting). By showing a purpose to\nfavor religion, the government “sends the … message to …\nnonadherents ‘that they are outsiders, not full members of the\npolitical community, and an accompanying message to adherents that\nthey are insiders, favored members… .’ ” Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U. S. 290 , 309–310 (2000) (quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668 , 688\n(1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring)). Indeed,\nthe purpose apparent from government action can have an impact more\nsignificant than the result expressly decreed: when the government\nmaintains Sunday closing laws, it advances religion only minimally\nbecause many working people would take the day as one of rest\nregardless, but if the government justified its decision with a\nstated desire for all Americans to honor Christ, the divisive\nthrust of the official action would be inescapable. This is the\nteaching of McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420 (1961), which upheld\nSunday closing statutes on practical, secular grounds after finding\nthat the government had forsaken the religious purposes behind\ncenturies-old predecessor laws. Id., at\n449–451. B Despite the intuitive importance of official purpose to the realization of Establishment Clause\nvalues, the Counties ask us to abandon Lemon ’s purpose\ntest, or at least to truncate any enquiry into purpose here. Their\nfirst argument is that the very consideration of purpose is\ndeceptive: according to them, true “purpose” is unknowable, and its\nsearch merely an excuse for courts to act selectively and\nunpredictably in picking out evidence of subjective intent. The\nassertions are as seismic as they are\nunconvincing. Examination of purpose is a staple of\nstatutory interpretation that makes up the daily fare of every\nappellate court in the country, e.g., General Dynamics\nLand Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581 , 600\n(2004) (interpreting statute in light of its “tex",

PERRY, in his official\ncapacity as GOVERNOR OF TEXAS and CHAIRMAN, STATE PRESERVATION\nBOARD, et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the fifth circuit No. 03–1500.Argued March 2, 2005—Decided June 27,\n2005 Among the 21 historical markers and 17 monuments\nsurrounding the Texas State Capitol is a 6-foot-high monolith\ninscribed with the Ten Commandments. The legislative record\nillustrates that, after accepting the monument from the Fraternal\nOrder of Eagles—a national social, civic, and patriotic\norganization—the State selected a site for it based on the\nrecommendation of the state organization that maintains the capitol\ngrounds. Petitioner, an Austin resident who encounters the monument\nduring his frequent visits to those grounds, brought this 42 U.\nS. C. §1983 suit seeking a declaration that the monument’s\nplacement violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause and\nan injunction requiring its removal. Holding that the monument did\nnot contravene the Clause, the District Court found that the State\nhad a valid secular purpose in recognizing and commending the\nEagles for their efforts to reduce juvenile delinquency, and that a\nreasonable observer, mindful of history, purpose, and context,\nwould not conclude that this passive monument conveyed the message\nthat the State endorsed religion. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. Held: The judgment is affirmed. 351 F. 3d 173, affirmed. The Chief Justice, joined by\nJustice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas, concluded that\nthe Establishment Clause allows the display of a monument inscribed\nwith the Ten Commandments on the Texas State Capitol grounds.\nReconciling the strong role played by religion and religious\ntraditions throughout our Nation’s history, see School Dist. of\nAbington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 , 212–213, with the\nprinciple that governmental intervention in religious matters can\nitself endanger religious freedom requires that the Court neither\nabdicate its responsibility to maintain a division between church\nand state nor evince a hostility to religion, e.g., Zorach v. Clauson , 343 U. S. 306 , 313–314.\nWhile the Court has sometimes pointed to Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U. S. 602 , for the\ngoverning test, Lemon is not useful in dealing with the\nsort of passive monument that Texas has erected on its capitol\ngrounds. Instead, the analysis should be driven by both the\nmonument’s nature and the Nation’s history. From at least 1789,\nthere has been an unbroken history of official acknowledgment by\nall three branches of government of religion’s role in American\nlife. Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668 , 674.\nTexas’ display of the Commandments on government property is\ntypical of such acknowledgments. Representations of the\nCommandments appear throughout this Court and its grounds, as well\nas the Nation’s Capital. Moreover, the Court’s opinions, like its\nbuilding, have recognized the role the Decalogue plays in America’s\nheritage. See, e.g. , McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420 , 442, 462.\nWhile the Commandments are religious, they have an undeniable\nhistorical meaning. Simply having religious content or promoting a\nmessage consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul of\nthe Establishment Clause. See, e.g., Lynch v. Donnelly, supra , at 680, 687. There are, of course, limits\nto the government’s display of religious messages or symbols. For\nexample, this Court held unconstitutional a Kentucky statute\nrequiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in every public\nschoolroom. Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39 , 41–42.\nHowever, neither Stone itself nor subsequent opinions have\nindicated that Stone ’s holding would extend beyond the\ncontext of public schools to a legislative chamber, see Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 , or to\ncapitol grounds. Texas’ placement of the Commandments monument on\nits capitol grounds is a far more passive use of those texts than\nwas the case in Stone, where the text confronted\nelementary school students every day. Indeed, petitioner here\napparently walked by the monument for years before bringing this\nsuit. Schempp, supra, and Lee v. Weisman , 505 U. S. 577 ,\ndistinguished. Texas has treated her capitol grounds monuments as\nrepresenting several strands in the State’s political and legal\nhistory. The inclusion of the Commandments monument in this group\nhas a dual significance, partaking of both religion and government,\nthat cannot be said to violate the Establishment Clause.\nPp. 3–12. Justice Breyer concluded that this is a\ndifficult borderline case where none of the Court’s various tests\nfor evaluating Establishment Clause questions can substitute for\nthe exercise of legal judgment. See, e.g., School Dist. of\nAbington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 , 305 (Goldberg, J.,\nconcurring). That judgment is not a personal judgment. Rather, as\nin all constitutional cases, it must reflect and remain faithful to\nthe underlying purposes of the First Amendment’s Religion\nClauses—to assure the fullest possible scope of religious liberty\nand tolerance for all, to avoid the religious divisiveness that\npromotes social conflict, and to maintain the separation of church\nand state. No exact formula can dictate a resolution to\nfact-intensive cases such as this. Despite the Commandments’\nreligious message, an inquiry into the context in which the text of\nthe Commandments is used demonstrates that the Commandments also\nconvey a secular moral message about proper standards of social\nconduct and a message about the historic relation between those\nstandards and the law. The circumstances surrounding the monument’s\nplacement on the capitol grounds and its physical setting provide a\nstrong, but not conclusive, indication that the Commandments’ text\nas used on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message.\nThe determinative factor here, however, is that 40 years passed in\nwhich the monument’s presence, legally speaking, went unchallenged\n(until the single legal objection raised by petitioner). Those 40\nyears suggest more strongly than can any set of\nformulaic tests that few individuals, whatever their belief\nsystems, are likely to have understood the monument as amounting,\nin any significantly detrimental way, to a government effort to\nestablish religion. See ibid. The public visiting the\ncapitol grounds is more likely to have considered the religious\naspect of the tablets’ message as part of what is a broader moral\nand historical message reflective of a cultural heritage. For these\nreasons, the Texas display falls on the permissible side of the\nconstitutional line. Pp. 1–8.

S. ____ (2005) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 03-1500 THOMAS VAN ORDEN, PETITIONER v. RICK\nPERRY, in his official capacity as GOVERNOR OF TEXAS and CHAIRMAN,\nSTATE PRESERVATION BOARD, et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit [June 27, 2005] Chief Justice Rehnquist announced\nthe judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which\nJustice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas join. The question here is whether the\nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment allows the display of a\nmonument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the Texas State\nCapitol grounds. We hold that it does. The 22 acres surrounding the Texas State\nCapitol contain 17 monuments and 21 historical markers\ncommemorating the “people, ideals, and events that compose Texan\nidentity.” Tex. H. Con. Res. 38, 77th Leg. (2001).[ Footnote 1 ] The monolith challenged here\nstands 6-feet high and 3-feet wide. It is located to the north of\nthe Capitol building, between the Capitol and the Supreme Court\nbuilding. Its primary content is the text of the Ten Commandments.\nAn eagle grasping the American flag, an eye inside of a pyramid,\nand two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script are\ncarved above the text of the Ten Commandments. Below the text are\ntwo Stars of David and the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho,\nwhich represent Christ. The bottom of the monument bears the\ninscription “PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE\nFRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n21. The legislative record surrounding the State’s\nacceptance of the monument from the Eagles—a national social,\ncivic, and patriotic organization—is limited to legislative journal\nentries. After the monument was accepted, the State selected a site\nfor the monument based on the recommendation of the state\norganization responsible for maintaining the Capitol grounds. The\nEagles paid the cost of erecting the monument, the dedication of\nwhich was presided over by two state legislators. Petitioner Thomas Van Orden is a native Texan\nand a resident of Austin. At one time he was a licensed lawyer,\nhaving graduated from Southern Methodist Law School. Van Orden\ntestified that, since 1995, he has encountered the Ten Commandments\nmonument during his frequent visits to the Capitol grounds. His\nvisits are typically for the purpose of using the law library in\nthe Supreme Court building, which is located just northwest of the\nCapitol building. Forty years after the monument’s erection and\nsix years after Van Orden began to encounter the monument\nfrequently, he sued numerous state officials in their official\ncapacities under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, seeking\nboth a declaration that the monument’s placement violates the\nEstablishment Clause and an injunction requiring its removal. After\na bench trial, the District Court held that the monument did not\ncontravene the Establishment Clause. It found that the State had a\nvalid secular purpose in recognizing and commending the Eagles for\ntheir efforts to reduce juvenile delinquency. The District Court\nalso determined that a reasonable observer, mindful of the history,\npurpose, and context, would not conclude that this passive monument\nconveyed the message that the State was seeking to endorse\nreligion. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s\nholdings with respect to the monument’s purpose and effect. 351\nF. 3d 173 (CA5 2003). We granted certiorari, 543 U. S. ___\n(2004), and now affirm. Our cases, Januslike, point in two directions\nin applying the Establishment Clause. One face looks toward the\nstrong role played by religion and religious traditions throughout\nour Nation’s history. As we observed in School Dist. of\nAbington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 (1963): “It is true that religion has\nbeen closely identified with our history and government… . The\nfact that the Founding Fathers believed devotedly that there was a\nGod and that the unalienable rights of man were rooted in Him is\nclearly evidenced in their writings, from the Mayflower Compact to\nthe Constitution itself… . It can be truly said, therefore,\nthat today, as in the beginning, our national life reflects a\nreligious people who, in the words of Madison, are ‘earnestly\npraying, as … in duty bound, that the Supreme Lawgiver of the\nUniverse … guide them into every measure which may be worthy of his\n[blessing … .]’ ” Id. , at 212–213.[ Footnote 2 ] The other face looks toward the principle that\ngovernmental intervention in religious matters can itself endanger\nreligious freedom. This case, like all Establishment Clause\nchallenges, presents us with the difficulty of respecting both\nfaces. Our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being, yet these\ninstitutions must not press religious observances upon their\ncitizens. One face looks to the past in acknowledgment of our\nNation’s heritage, while the other looks to the present in\ndemanding a separation between church and state. Reconciling these\ntwo faces requires that we neither abdicate our responsibility to\nmaintain a division between church and state nor evince a hostility\nto religion by disabling the government from in some ways\nrecognizing our religious heritage: “When the state encourages religious instruction or\ncooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of\npublic events to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our\ntraditions. For it then respects the religious nature of our people\nand accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs. To\nhold that it may not would be to find in the Constitution a\nrequirement that the government show a callous indifference to\nreligious groups… . [W]e find no constitutional requirement\nwhich makes it necessary for government to be hostile to religion\nand to throw its weight against efforts to widen the effective\nscope of religious influence.” Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306 , 313–314 (1952). See also Rosenberger v. Rector and\nVisitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 , 845–846 (1995) (warning\nagainst the “risk [of] fostering a pervasive bias or hostility to\nreligion, which could undermine the very neutrality the\nEstablishment Clause requires”).[ Footnote 3 ] These two faces are evident in representative\ncases both upholding[ Footnote\n4 ] and invalidating[ Footnote\n5 ] laws under the Establishment Clause. Over the last 25 years,\nwe have sometimes pointed to Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U. S. 602 (1971), as providing the governing test in Establishment Clause\nchallenges.[ Footnote 6 ] Compare Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38 (1985) (applying Lemon ), with Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783 (1983) (not applying Lemon ). Yet, just two years after Lemon was\ndecided, we noted that the factors identified in Lemon serve as “no more than helpful signposts.” Hunt v. McNair, 413\nU. S. 734 , 741 (1973). Many of our recent cases simply have not\napplied the Lemon test. See, e.g. , Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U. S. 639 (2002); Good News\nClub v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98 (2001). Others have\napplied it only after concluding that the challenged practice was\ninvalid under a different Establishment Clause test. Whatever may be the fate of the Lemon test in the larger scheme of Establishment Clause jurisprudence, we\nthink it not useful in dealing with the sort of passive monument\nthat Texas has erected on its Capitol grounds. Instead, our\nanalysis is driven both by the nature of the monument and by our\nNation’s history. As we explained in Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668 (1984): “There is an\nunbroken history of official acknowledgment by all three branches\nof government of the role of religion in American life from at\nleast 1789.” Id., at 674. For example, both Houses passed\nresolutions in 1789 asking President George Washington to issue a\nThanksgiving Day Proclamation to “recommend to the people of the\nUnited States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be\nobserved by acknowledging, with grateful hearts, the many and\nsignal favors of Almighty God.” 1 Annals of Cong. 90, 914.\nPresident Washington’s proclamation directly attributed to the\nSupreme Being the foundations and successes of our young\nNation: “Now, therefore, I do recommend\nand assign Thursday, the 26th day of November next, to be devoted\nby the people of these States to the service of that great and\nglorious Being who is the beneficent author of all the good that\nwas, that is, or that will be; that we may then all unite in\nrendering unto Him our sincere and humble thanks for His kind care\nand protection of the people of this country previous to their\nbecoming a nation; for the signal and manifold mercies and the\nfavorable interpositions of His providence in the course and\nconclusion of the late war; for the great degree of tranquillity,\nunion, and plenty which we have since enjoyed; for the peaceable\nand rational manner in which we have been enabled to establish\nconstitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and\nparticularly the national one now lately instituted; for the civil\nand religious liberty with which we are blessed, and the means we\nhave of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge; and, in general,\nfor all the great and various favors which He has been pleased to\nconfer upon us.” 1 J. Richardson, Messages and Papers of the\nPresidents, 1789–1897, p. 64 (1899). Recognition of the role of God in\nour Nation’s heritage has also been reflected in our decisions. We\nhave acknowledged, for example, that “religion has been closely\nidentified with our history and government,” School Dist. of\nAbington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S., at 212, and\nthat “[t]he history of man is inseparable from the history of\nreligion,” Engel v. Vitale, 370\nU. S. 421 , 434 (1962).[ Footnote\n7 ] This recognition has led us to hold that the Establishment\nClause permits a state legislature to open its daily sessions with\na prayer by a chaplain paid by the State. Marsh v. Chambers , 463 U. S., at 792.[ Footnote 8 ] Such a practice, we thought, was “deeply\nembedded in the history and tradition of this country.” Id. , at 786. As we observed there, “it would be\nincongruous to interpret [the Establishment Clause] as imposing\nmore stringent First Amendment limits on the states than the\ndraftsmen imposed on the Federal Government.” Id. , at\n790–791. With similar reasoning, we have upheld laws, which\noriginated from one of the Ten Commandments, that prohibited the\nsale of merchandise on Sunday. McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420 , 431–440\n(1961); see id ., at 470–488 (separate opinion of\nFrankfurter, J.). In this case we are faced with a display of\nthe Ten Commandments on government property outside the Texas State\nCapitol. Such acknowledgments of the role played by the Ten\nCommandments in our Nation’s heritage are common throughout\nAmerica. We need only look within our own Courtroom. Since 1935,\nMoses has stood, holding two tablets that reveal portions of the\nTen Commandments written in Hebrew, among other lawgivers in the\nsouth frieze. Representations of the Ten Commandments adorn the\nmetal gates lining the north and south sides of the Courtroom as\nwell as the doors leading into the Courtroom. Moses also sits on\nthe exterior east facade of the building holding the Ten\nCommandments tablets. Similar acknowledgments can be seen throughout\na visitor’s tour of our Nation’s Capital. For example, a large\nstatue of Moses holding the Ten Commandments, alongside a statue of\nthe Apostle Paul, has overlooked the rotunda of the Library of\nCongress’ Jefferson Building since 1897. And the Jefferson\nBuilding’s Great Reading Room contains a sculpture of a woman\nbeside the Ten Commandments with a quote above her from the Old\nTestament (Micah 6:8). A medallion with two tablets depicting the\nTen Commandments decorates the floor of the National Archives.\nInside the Department of Justice, a statue entitled “The Spirit of\nLaw” has two tablets representing the Ten Commandments lying at its\nfeet. In front of the Ronald Reagan Building is another sculpture\nthat includes a depiction of the Ten Commandments. So too a\n24-foot-tall sculpture, depicting, among other things, the Ten\nCommandments and a cross, stands outside the federal courthouse\nthat houses both the Court of Appeals and the District Court for\nthe District of Columbia. Moses is also prominently featured in the\nChamber of the United States House of Representatives.[ Footnote 9 ] Our opinions, like our building, have\nrecognized the role the Decalogue plays in America’s heritage. See, e.g. , McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S., at\n442; id. , at 462 (separate opinion of Frankfurter,\nJ.).[ Footnote 10 ] The\nExecutive and Legislative Branches have also acknowledged the\nhistorical role of the Ten Commandments. See, e.g. , Public\nPapers of the Presidents, Harry S. Truman, 1950, p. 157 (1965); S.\nCon. Res. 13, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (1997); H. Con. Res. 31, 105th\nCong., 1st Sess. (1997). These displays and recognitions of the Ten\nCommandments bespeak the rich American tradition of religious\nacknowledgments. Of course, the Ten Commandments are\nreligious—they were so viewed at their inception and so remain. The\nmonument, therefore, has religious significance. According to\nJudeo-Christian belief, the Ten Commandments were given to Moses by\nGod on Mt. Sinai. But Moses was a lawgiver as well as a religious\nleader. And the Ten Commandments have an undeniable historical\nmeaning, as the foregoing examples demonstrate. Simply having\nreligious content or promoting a message consistent with a\nreligious doctrine does not run afoul of the Establishment Clause.\nSee Lynch v. Donnelly , 465 U. S., at 680, 687; Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S., at 792; McGowan v. Maryland , supra , at 437–440; Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 , 676–678 (1970). There are, of course, limits to the display of\nreligious messages or symbols. For example, we held\nunconstitutional a Kentucky statute requiring the posting of the\nTen Commandments in every public schoolroom. Stone v. Graham, 449 U. S. 39 (1980) (per\ncuriam) . In the classroom context, we found that the Kentucky\nstatute had an improper and plainly religious purpose. Id. , at 41. As evidenced by Stone ’s almost\nexclusive reliance upon two of our school prayer cases, id. , at 41–42 (citing School Dist. of Abington\nTownship v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 (1963), and Engel v. Vitale, 370\nU. S. 421 (1962)), it stands as an example of the fact that we\nhave “been particularly vigilant in monitoring compliance with the\nEstablishment Clause in elementary and secondary schools,” Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578 , 583–584 (1987). Compare Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577 , 596–597 (1992) (holding\nunconstitutional a prayer at a secondary school graduation), with Marsh v. Chambers, supra (upholding a prayer in\nthe state legislature). Indeed, Edwards v. Aguillard recognized that Stone —along with Schempp and Engel —was a consequence of the\n“particular concerns that arise in the context of public elementary\nand secondary schools.” 482 U. S., at 584–585. Neither Stone itself nor subsequent opinions have indicated that Stone ’s holding would extend to a legislative chamber, see Marsh v. Chambers, supra , or to capitol\ngrounds.[ Footnote 11 ] The placement of the Ten Commandments monument\non the Texas State Capitol grounds is a far more passive use of\nthose texts than was the case in Stone, where the text\nconfronted elementary school students every day. Indeed, Van Orden,\nthe petitioner here, apparently walked by the monument for a number\nof years before bringing this lawsuit. The monument is therefore\nalso quite different from the prayers involved in Schempp and Lee v. Weisman . Texas has treated her Capitol\ngrounds monuments as representing the several strands in the\nState’s political and legal history. The inclusion of the Ten\nCommandments monument in this group has a dual significance,\npartaking of both religion and government. We cannot say that\nTexas’ display of this monument violates the Establishment Clause\nof the First Amendment. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\naffirmed. It is so ordered. Footnote 1 The monuments are: Heroes of the Alamo,\nHood’s Brigade, Confederate Soldiers, Volunteer Fireman, Terry’s\nTexas Rangers, Texas Cowboy, Spanish-American War, Texas National\nGuard, Ten Commandments, Tribute to Texas School Children, Texas\nPioneer Woman, The Boy Scouts’ Statue of Liberty Replica, Pearl\nHarbor Veterans, Korean War Veterans, Soldiers of World War I,\nDisabled Veterans, and Texas Peace Officers. Footnote 2 See also Engel v. Vitale, 370\nU. S. 421 , 434 (1962) (“The history of man is inseparable from\nthe history of religion”); Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306 , 313 (1952) (“We are a\nreligious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme\nBeing”). Footnote 3 Despite Justice Stevens’ recitation of\noccasional language to the contrary, post , at 4–5, and n.\n7 (dissenting opinion), we have not, and do not, adhere to the\nprinciple that the Establishment Clause bars any and all\ngovernmental preference for religion over irreligion. See, e.g. , Cutter v. Wilkinson , 544 U. S. __\n(2005); Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus\nChrist of Latter&nbhyph;day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327 (1987); Lynch v.

S., at 793–794, and n. 14. Footnote 9 Other examples of monuments and buildings\nreflecting the prominent role of religion abound. For example, the\nWashington, Jefferson, and Lincoln Memorials all contain explicit\ninvocations of God’s importance. The apex of the Washington\nMonument is inscribed “Laus Deo,” which is translated to mean\n“Praise be to God,” and multiple memorial stones in the monument\ncontain Biblical citations. The Jefferson Memorial is engraved with\nthree quotes from Jefferson that make God a central theme.\nInscribed on the wall of the Lincoln Memorial are two of Lincoln’s\nmost famous speeches, the Gettysburg Address and his Second\nInaugural Address. Both inscriptions include those speeches’\nextensive acknowledgments of God. The first federal monument, which\nwas accepted by the United States in honor of sailors who died in\nTripoli, noted the dates of the fallen sailors as “the year of our\nLord, 1804, and in the 28 year of the independence of the United\nStates.” Footnote 10 See also Edwards v.

Aguillard, supra , at\n593–594 (“ [Stone] did not mean that no use could ever be\nmade of the Ten Commandments, or that the Ten Commandments played\nan exclusively religious role in the history of Western\nCivilization”). Indeed, we need not decide in this case the extent\nto which a primarily religious purpose would affect our analysis\nbecause it is clear from the record that there is no evidence of\nsuch a purpose in this case.",

DRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS\nDEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS\nDIVISION certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the fifth circuit No. 03–9659.Argued December 6, 2004—Decided June\n13, 2005 When Dallas County prosecutors used peremptory\nstrikes against 10 of the 11 qualified black venire members during\njury selection for petitioner Miller-El’s capital murder trial, he\nobjected, claiming that the strikes were based on race and could\nnot be presumed legitimate since the District Attorney’s Office had\na history of excluding blacks from criminal juries. The trial court\ndenied his request for a new jury, and his trial ended with a death\nsentence. While his appeal was pending, this Court decided, in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 , that\ndiscrimination by a prosecutor in selecting a defendant’s jury\nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment. On remand, the trial court\nreviewed the voir dire record, heard prosecutor Macaluso’s\njustifications for the strikes that were not explained during voir dire , and found no showing that prospective black\njurors were struck because of their race. The State Court of\nCriminal Appeals affirmed. Subsequently, the Federal District Court\ndenied Miller-El federal habeas relief, and the Fifth Circuit\ndenied a certificate of appealability. This Court reversed, finding\nthat the merits of Miller-El’s Batson claim were, at\nleast, debatable by jurists of reason. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322 . The Fifth\nCircuit granted a certificate of appealability but rejected\nMiller-El’s Batson claim on the merits. Held: Miller-El is entitled to\nprevail on his Batson claim and, thus, entitled to habeas\nrelief. Pp. 3–33. (a) “[T]his Court\nconsistently and repeatedly has reaffirmed that racial\ndiscrimination by the State in jury selection offends the Equal\nProtection Clause.” Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42 , 44. The rub\nhas been the practical difficulty of ferreting out discrimination\nin selections discretionary by nature and subject to a myriad of\nlegitimate influences. The Batson Court held that a\ndefendant can make out a prima facie case of discriminatory jury\nselection by “the totality of the relevant facts” about a\nprosecutor’s conduct during the defendant’s own trial. 476 U. S.,\nat 94. Once that showing is made, the burden shifts to the State to\ncome forward with a neutral explanation, id., at 97, and\nthe trial court must determine if the defendant has shown\n“purposeful discrimination,” id., at 98, in light of “all\nrelevant circumstances,” id. , at 96–97. Since this case is\non review of a denial of habeas relief under 28 U. S. C.\n§2254, and since the Texas trial court’s prior determination that\nthe State’s race-neutral explanations were true is a factual\ndetermination, Miller-El may obtain relief only by showing the\ntrial court’s conclusion to be “an unreasonable determination of\nthe facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding,” §2254(e)(1). Pp. 3–6. (b) The prosecutors used peremptory\nstrikes to exclude 91% of the eligible black venire panelists, a\ndisparity unlikely to have been produced by happenstance. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. at 342. More\npowerful than the bare statistics are side-by-side comparisons of\nsome black venire panelists who were struck and white ones who were\nnot. If a prosecutor’s proffered reason for striking a black\npanelist applies just as well to a white panelist allowed to serve,\nthat is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination. The\ndetails of two panel member comparisons bear out this Court’s\nobservation, id., at 343, that the prosecution’s reason\nfor exercising peremptory strikes against some black panel members\nappeared to apply equally to some white jurors. There are strong\nsimilarities and some differences between Billy Jean Fields, a\nblack venireman who expressed unwavering support for the death\npenalty but was struck, and similarly situated nonblack jurors; but\nthe differences seem far from significant, particularly when\nreading Fields’s voir dire testimony in its entirety. Upon\nthat reading, Fields should have been an ideal juror in the eyes of\na prosecutor seeking a death sentence, and the prosecutors’\nexplanations for the strike, that Fields would not vote for death\nif rehabilitation were possible, a mischaracterization of his\ntestimony, cannot reasonably be accepted when there were nonblack\nveniremen expressing comparable views on rehabilitation who were\nnot struck. The prosecution’s reason that Fields’s brother had\nprior convictions is not creditable in light of its failure to\nenquire about the matter. The prosecution’s proffered reasons for\nstriking Joe Warren, another black venireman, are comparably\nunlikely. The fact that the reason for striking him, that he\nthought death was an easy way out and defendants should be made to\nsuffer more, also applied to nonblack panel members who were\nselected is evidence of pretext. The suggestion of pretext is not,\nmoreover, mitigated by Macaluso’s explanation that Warren was\nstruck when the State could afford to be liberal in using its 10\nremaining peremptory challenges. Were that the explanation for\nstriking Warren and later accepting similar panel members,\nprosecutors would have struck white panel member Jenkins, who was\nexamined and accepted before Warren despite her similar views.\nMacaluso’s explanation also weakens any suggestion that the State’s\nacceptance of Woods, the one black juror, shows that race was not\nin play. When he was selected as the eighth juror, the State had\nused 11 of its 15 peremptory challenges, 7 on black panel members;\nand the record shows that at least 3 of the remaining venire panel\nopposed capital punishment. Because the prosecutors had to exercise\nprudent restraint, the late-stage decision to accept a black panel\nmember willing to impose the death penalty does not neutralize the\nearly-stage decision to challenge a comparable venireman, Warren.\nThe Fifth Circuit’s substituted reason for the elimination,\nWarren’s general ambivalence about the penalty, was erroneous as a\nmatter of fact and law. As to fact, Macaluso said nothing about\ngeneral ambivalence, and Warren’s answer to several questions was\nthat he could impose the death penalty. As for law, the Batson rule provides the prosecutor an opportunity to give\nthe reason for striking a juror and requires the judge to assess\nthe reason’s plausibility in light of all of the evidence, but it\ndoes not does not call for a mere exercise in thinking up any\nrational basis. Because a prosecutor is responsible for the reason\nhe gave, the Fifth Circuit’s substitution of a reason for excluding\nWarren does nothing to satisfy the prosecutors’ burden of stating a\nracially neutral explanation for their own actions. Comparing\nWarren’s strike with the treatment of panel members with similar\nviews supports a conclusion that race was significant in\ndetermining who was challenged and who was not. Pp. 6–19. (c) The prosecution’s broader patterns of\npractice during jury selection also support the case for\ndiscrimination. Texas law permits either side to shuffle the cards\nbearing panel member names to rearrange the order in which they are\nquestioned. Members seated in the back may escape voir\ndire , for those not questioned by the end of each week are\ndismissed. Here, the prosecution shuffled the cards when a number\nof black members were seated at the front of the panel at the\nbeginning of the second week. The third week, they shuffled when\nthe first four members were black, placing them in the back. After\nthe defense reshuffled the cards, and the black members reappeared\nin the front, the court denied the prosecution’s request for\nanother shuffle. No racially neutral reason for the shuffling has\never been offered, and nothing stops the suspicion of\ndiscriminatory intent from rising to an inference. The contrasting voir dire questions posed respectively to black and\nnonblack panel members also indicate that the State was trying to\navoid black jurors. Prosecutors gave a bland description of the\ndeath penalty to 94% of white venire panel members before asking\nabout the individual’s feelings on the subject, but used a script\ndescribing imposition of the death penalty in graphic terms for 53%\nof the black venire members. The argument that prosecutors used the\ngraphic script to weed out ambivalent panel members simply does not\nfit the facts. Black venire members were more likely to receive\nthat script regardless of their expressions of certainty or\nambivalence about the death penalty, and the State’s chosen\nexplanation failed for four out of the eight black panel members\nwho received it: two received it after clearly stating their\nopposition to the death penalty and two received it even though\nthey unambiguously favored that penalty. The State’s explanation\nmisses the mark four out of five times with regard to the nonblacks\nwho received the graphic description. Ambivalent black panel\nmembers were also more likely to receive the graphic script than\nnonblack ambivalent ones. The State’s attempt at a race-neutral\nrationalization fails to explain what the prosecutors did. The\nexplanation that the prosecutors’ first object was to use the\ngraphic script to make a case for excluding black panel members\nopposed to, or ambivalent about, the death penalty is more\npersuasive than the State’s explanation, and the reasonable\ninference is that race was the major consideration when the\nprosecution chose to follow the graphic script. The same is true\nfor another kind of disparate questioning. The prosecutors asked\nall black panel members opposed to, or ambivalent about, the death\npenalty how low a sentence they would consider imposing for murder\nwithout telling them that the State requires a 5-year minimum, but\nprosecutors did not put that question to most white panel members\nwho had expressed similar views. The final body of evidence\nconfirming the conclusion here is that the Dallas County District\nAttorney’s Office had, for decades, followed a specific policy of\nsystematically excluding blacks from juries. The Miller-El\nprosecutors’ notes of the race of each panel member show that they\ntook direction from a jury selection manual that included racial\nstereotypes. Pp. 19–31. (d) The Fifth Circuit’s conclusion that\nMiller-El failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the\nstate court’s no-discrimination finding was wrong is as\nunsupportable as the “dismissive and strained interpretation” of\nhis evidence that this Court disapproved when deciding that he was\nentitled to a certificate of appealability, Miller-El, supra, at 344. Ten of the eleven black venire members were\nperemptorily struck. At least two of them were ostensibly\nacceptable to prosecutors seeking the death penalty. The\nprosecutors’ chosen race-neutral reasons for the strikes do not\nhold up and are so far at odds with the evidence that pretext is\nthe fair conclusion. The selection process was replete with\nevidence that prosecutors were selecting and rejecting potential\njurors because of race. And the prosecutors took their cues from a\nmanual on jury selection with an emphasis on race. It blinks\nreality to deny that the State struck Fields and Warren because\nthey were black. The facts correlate to nothing as well as to race.\nThe state court’s contrary conclusion was unreasonable as well as\nerroneous. Pp. 32–33. 361 F. 3d 849, reversed and remanded. Souter, J., delivered the opinion\nof the Court, in which Stevens, O’Connor, Kennedy, Ginsburg, and\nBreyer, JJ., joined. Breyer, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nThomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist,\nC. J., and Scalia, J., joined. OPINION OF THE COURT MILLER-EL V. DRETKE 545 U. S. ____ (2005) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 03-9659 THOMAS JOE MILLER-EL, PETITIONER v. DOUG\nDRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE,\nCORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit [June 13, 2005] Justice Souter delivered the\nopinion of the Court. Two years ago, we ordered that a\ncertificate of appealability, under 28 U. S. C. §2253(c), be\nissued to habeas petitioner Miller-El, affording review of the\nDistrict Court’s rejection of the claim that prosecutors in his\ncapital murder trial made peremptory strikes of potential jurors\nbased on race. Today we find Miller-El entitled to prevail on that\nclaim and order relief under §2254. I In the course of robbing a\nHoliday Inn in Dallas, Texas in late 1985, Miller-El and his\naccomplices bound and gagged two hotel employees, whom Miller-El\nthen shot, killing one and severely injuring the other. During jury\nselection in Miller-El’s trial for capital murder, prosecutors used\nperemptory strikes against 10 qualified black venire members.\nMiller-El objected that the strikes were based on race and could\nnot be presumed legitimate, given a history of excluding black\nmembers from criminal juries by the Dallas County District\nAttorney’s Office. The trial court received evidence of the\npractice alleged but found no “systematic exclusion of blacks as a\nmatter of policy” by that office, App. 882–883, and therefore no\nentitlement to relief under Swain v. Alabama , 380 U. S. 202 (1965), the case then defining and marking the limits of relief\nfrom racially biased jury selection. The court denied Miller-El’s\nrequest to pick a new jury, and the trial ended with his death\nsentence for capital murder. While an appeal was pending, this\nCourt decided Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986), which replaced Swain ’s threshold requirement to prove systemic\ndiscrimination under a Fourteenth Amendment jury claim, with the\nrule that discrimination by the prosecutor in selecting the\ndefendant’s jury sufficed to establish the constitutional\nviolation. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals then remanded the\nmatter to the trial court to determine whether Miller-El could show\nthat prosecutors in his case peremptorily struck prospective black\njurors because of race. Miller-El v. State , 748\nS. W. 2d 459 (1988). The trial court found no such demonstration.\nAfter reviewing the voir dire record of the explanations\ngiven for some of the challenged strikes, and after hearing one of\nthe prosecutors, Paul Macaluso, give his justification for those\npreviously unexplained, the trial court accepted the stated\nrace-neutral reasons for the strikes, which the judge called\n“completely credible [and] sufficient” as the grounds for a finding\nof “no purposeful discrimination.” Findings of Fact and Conclusions\nof Law Upon Remand from the Court of Criminal Appeals in State v. Miller-El, No. 8668–NL (5th Crim. Dist.\nCt., Dallas County, Tex., Jan. 13, 1989), pp. 5–6, App.\n928–929. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, stating it found\n“ample support” in the voir dire record for the\nrace-neutral explanations offered by prosecutors for the peremptory\nstrikes. Miller-El v. State, No. 69,677 (Sept.\n16, 1992) (per curiam) , p. 2, App. 931. Miller-El then sought habeas relief under 28\nU. S. C. §2254, again pressing his Batson claim,\namong others not now before us. The District Court denied relief, Miller-El v. Johnson , Civil No. 3:96–CV–1992–H\n(ND Tex., June 5, 2000), App. 987, and the Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit precluded appeal by denying a certificate of\nappealability, Miller-El v. Johnson, 261\nF. 3d 445 (2001). We granted certiorari to consider whether\nMiller-El was entitled to review on the Batson claim, Miller-El v. Cockrell, 534 U. S. 1122 (2002),\nand reversed the Court of Appeals. After examining the record of\nMiller-El’s extensive evidence of purposeful discrimination by the\nDallas County District Attorney’s Office before and during his\ntrial, we found an appeal was in order, since the merits of the Batson claim were, at the least, debatable by jurists of\nreason. Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U. S. 322 (2003). After granting a\ncertificate of appealability, the Fifth Circuit rejected\nMiller-El’s Batson claim on the merits. 361 F. 3d 849\n(2004). We again granted certiorari, 542 U. S. 936 (2004),\nand again we reverse. II A “It is well known that prejudices\noften exist against particular classes in the community, which sway\nthe judgment of jurors, and which, therefore, operate in some cases\nto deny to persons of those classes the full enjoyment of that\nprotection which others enjoy.” Strauder v. West\nVirginia , 100\nU. S. 303 , 309 (1880); see also Batson v. Kentucky , supra , at 86. Defendants are harmed, of\ncourse, when racial discrimination in jury selection compromises\nthe right of trial by impartial jury, Strauder v. West\nVirginia , supra , at 308, but racial minorities are\nharmed more generally, for prosecutors drawing racial lines in\npicking juries establish “state-sponsored group stereotypes rooted\nin, and reflective of, historical prejudice,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127 ,\n128 (1994). Nor is the harm confined to\nminorities. When the government’s choice of jurors is tainted with\nracial bias, that “overt wrong … casts doubt over the obligation of\nthe parties, the jury, and indeed the court to adhere to the law\nthroughout the trial … .” Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S. 400 ,\n412 (1991). That is, the very integrity of the courts is\njeopardized when a prosecutor’s discrimination “invites cynicism\nrespecting the jury’s neutrality,” id. , at 412, and\nundermines public confidence in adjudication, Georgia v. McCollum , 505 U. S. 42 , 49 (1992); Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co. , 500 U. S. 614 , 628\n(1991); Batson v. Kentucky , supra, at\n87. So, “[f]or more than a century, this Court consistently and\nrepeatedly has reaffirmed that racial discrimination by the State\nin jury selection offends the Equal Protection Clause.” Georgia v. McCollum , supra , at 44; see Strauder v. West Virginia , supra , at\n308, 310; Norris v. Alabama , 294 U. S. 587 , 596 (1935); Swain v. Alabama , supra, at 223–224; Batson v. Kentucky , supra , at 84; Powers v. Ohio , supra , at 404. The rub has been the practical difficulty of\nferreting out discrimination in selections discretionary by nature,\nand choices subject to myriad legitimate influences, whatever the\nrace of the individuals on the panel from which jurors are\nselected. In Swain v. Alabama , we tackled the\nproblem of “the quantum of proof necessary” to show purposeful\ndiscrimination, 380 U. S., at 205, with an eye to preserving each\nside’s historical prerogative to make a peremptory strike or\nchallenge, the very nature of which is traditionally “without a\nreason stated,” id. , at 220. The Swain Court\ntried to relate peremptory challenge to equal protection by\npresuming the legitimacy of prosecutors’ strikes except in the face\nof a longstanding pattern of discrimination: when “in case after\ncase, whatever the circumstances,” no blacks served on juries, then\n“giving even the widest leeway to the operation of irrational but\ntrial-related suspicions and antagonisms, it would appear that the\npurposes of the peremptory challenge [were] being perverted.” Id. , at 223–224. Swain ’s demand to make out a\ncontinuity of discrimination over time, however, turned out to be\ndifficult to the point of unworkable, and in Batson v. Kentucky , we recognized that this requirement to show an\nextended pattern imposed a “crippling burden of proof” that left\nprosecutors’ use of peremptories “largely immune from\nconstitutional scrutiny.” 476 U. S., at 92–93. By Batson ’s\nday, the law implementing equal protection elsewhere had evolved\ninto less discouraging standards for assessing a claim of\npurposeful discrimination, id. , at 93–95 (citing, e.g. , Washington v. Davis , 426 U. S. 229 (1976),\nand Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing\nDevelopment Corp. , 429 U. S. 252 (1977)),\nand we accordingly held that a defendant could make out a prima\nfacie case of discriminatory jury selection by “the totality of the\nrelevant facts” about a prosecutor’s conduct during the defendant’s\nown trial. Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S., at 94,\n96. “Once the defendant makes a prima facie showing, the burden\nshifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation for\nchallenging … jurors” within an arguably targeted class. Id. , at 97. Although there may be “any number of bases on\nwhich a prosecutor reasonably [might] believe that it is desirable\nto strike a juror who is not excusable for cause … , the\nprosecutor must give a clear and reasonably specific explanation of\nhis legitimate reasons for exercising the challeng[e].” Id. , at 98, n. 20 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n“The trial court then will have the duty to determine if the\ndefendant has established purposeful discrimination.” Id. ,\nat 98. Although the move from Swain to Batson left a defendant free to challenge the prosecution\nwithout having to cast Swain ’s wide net, the net was not\nentirely consigned to history, for Batson ’s individualized\nfocus came with a weakness of its own owing to its very emphasis on\nthe particular reasons a prosecutor might give. If any facially\nneutral reason sufficed to answer a Batson challenge, then Batson would not amount to much more than Swain .\nSome stated reasons are false, and although some false reasons are\nshown up within the four corners of a given case, sometimes a court\nmay not be sure unless it looks beyond the case at hand. Hence Batson ’s explanation that a defendant may rely on “all\nrelevant circumstances” to raise an inference of purposeful\ndiscrimination. 476 U. S., at 96–97. B This case comes to us on review\nof a denial of habeas relief sought under 28 U. S. C. §2254,\nfollowing the Texas trial court’s prior determination of fact that\nthe State’s race-neutral explanations were true, see Purkett v. Elem , 514 U. S. 765 , 769\n(1995) (per curiam); Batson v. Kentucky , supra , at 98, n. 21. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996, Miller-El may obtain relief only by showing\nthe Texas conclusion to be “an unreasonable determination of the\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2). Thus we presume the\nTexas court’s factual findings to be sound unless Miller-El rebuts\nthe “presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.”\n§2254(e)(1). The standard is demanding but not insatiable; as we\nsaid the last time this case was here, “[d]eference does not by\ndefinition preclude relief.” Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U. S., at 340. III A The numbers describing the\nprosecution’s use of peremptories are remarkable. Out of 20 black\nmembers of the 108-person venire panel for Miller-El’s trial, only\n1 served. Although 9 were excused for cause or by agreement, 10\nwere peremptorily struck by the prosecution. Id. , at 331.\n“The prosecutors used their peremptory strikes to exclude 91% of\nthe eligible African-American venire members … . Happenstance\nis unlikely to produce this disparity.” Id. , at 342. More powerful than these bare\nstatistics, however, are side-by-side comparisons of some black\nvenire panelists who were struck and white panelists allowed to\nserve. If a prosecutor’s proffered reason for striking a black\npanelist applies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack who\nis permitted to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful\ndiscrimination to be considered at Batson ’s third step.\nCf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc. , 530 U. S. 133 ,\n147 (2000) (in employment discrimination cases, “[p]roof that the\ndefendant’s explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form\nof circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional\ndiscrimination, and it may be quite persuasive”). While we did not\ndevelop a comparative juror analysis last time, we did note that\nthe prosecution’s reasons for exercising peremptory strikes against\nsome black panel members appeared equally on point as to some white\njurors who served. Miller-El v. Cockrell , supra , at 343.[ Footnote\n1 ] The details of two panel member comparisons bear this\nout.[ Footnote 2 ] The prosecution used its second peremptory\nstrike to exclude Billy Jean Fields, a black man who expressed\nunwavering support for the death penalty. On the questionnaire\nfilled out by all panel members before individual examination on\nthe stand, Fields said that he believed in capital punishment,\nJoint Lodging 14, and during questioning he disclosed his belief\nthat the State acts on God’s behalf when it imposes the death\npenalty. “Therefore, if the State exacts death, then that’s what it\nshould be.” App. 174. He testified that he had no religious or\nphilosophical reservations about the death penalty and that the\ndeath penalty deterred crime. Id. , at 174–175. He twice\naverred, without apparent hesitation, that he could sit on\nMiller-El’s jury and make a decision to impose this penalty. Id. , at 176–177. Although at one point in the questioning,\nFields indicated that the possibility of rehabilitation might be\nrelevant to the likelihood that a defendant would commit future\nacts of violence, id. , at 183, he responded to ensuing\nquestions by saying that although he believed anyone could be\nrehabilitated, this belief would not stand in the way of a decision\nto impose the death penalty: “[B]ased on what you [the prosecutor] said as far\nas the crime goes, there are only two things that could be\nrendered, death or life in prison. If for some reason the testimony\ndidn’t warrant death, then life imprisonment would give an\nindividual an opportunity to rehabilitate. But, you know, you said\nthat the jurors didn’t have the opportunity to make a personal\ndecision in the matter with reference to what I thought or felt,\nbut it was just based on the questions according to the way the law\nhas been handed down.” Id. , at 185 (alteration\nomitted). Fields also noted on his\nquestionnaire that his brother had a criminal history. Joint\nLodging 13. During questioning, the prosecution went into this,\ntoo: “Q   Could you tell me a little bit\nabout that? “A   He was arrested and convicted on [a] number\nof occasions for possession of a controlled substance. “Q   Was that here in Dallas? “A   Yes. “Q   Was he involved in any trials or anything\nlike that? “A   I suppose of sorts. I don’t really know too\nmuch about it. “Q   Was he ever convicted? “A   Yeah, he served time. “Q   Do you feel that that would in any way\ninterfere with your service on this jury at all? “A   No.” App. 190. Fields was struck peremptorily by\nthe prosecution, with prosecutor James Nelson offering a\nrace-neutral reason: “[W]e … have concern with reference to some of his\nstatements as to the death penalty in that he said that he could\nonly give death if he thought a person could not be rehabilitated\nand he later made the comment that any person could be\nrehabilitated if they find God or are introduced to God and the\nfact that we have a concern that his religious feelings may affect\nhis jury service in this case.” Id. , at 197 (alteration\nomitted). Thus, Nelson simply\nmischaracterized Fields’s testimony. He represented that Fields\nsaid he would not vote for death if rehabilitation was possible,\nwhereas Fields unequivocally stated that he could impose the death\npenalty regardless of the possibility of rehabilitation. Perhaps\nNelson misunderstood, but unless he had an ulterior reason for\nkeeping Fields off the jury we think he would have proceeded\ndifferently. In light of Fields’s outspoken support for the death\npenalty, we expect the prosecutor would have cleared up any\nmisunderstanding by asking further questions before getting to the\npoint of exercising a strike. If, indeed, Fields’s thoughts on\nrehabilitation did make the prosecutor uneasy, he should have\nworried about a number of white panel members he accepted with no\nevident reservations. Sandra Hearn said that she believed in the\ndeath penalty “if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated and continues\nto commit the same type of crime.” Id. , at 429.[ Footnote 3 ] Hearn went so far as to\nexpress doubt that at the penalty phase of a capital case she could\nconclude that a convicted murderer “would probably commit some\ncriminal acts of violence in the future.” Id. , at 440.\n“People change,” she said, making it hard to assess the risk of\nsomeone’s future dangerousness. “[T]he evidence would have to be\nawful strong.” Ibid . But the prosecution did not respond\nto Hearn the way it did to Fields, and without delving into her\nviews about rehabilitation with any further question, it raised no\nobjection to her serving on the jury. White panelist Mary Witt said\nshe would take the possibility of rehabilitation into account in\ndeciding at the penalty phase of the trial about a defendant’s\nprobability of future dangerousness, 6 Record of Voir Dire 2433 (hereinafter Record), but the prosecutors asked her no further\nquestion about her views on reformation, and they accepted her as a\njuror. Id. , at 2464–2465.[ Footnote 4 ] Latino venireman Fernando Gutierrez, who\nserved on the jury, said that he would consider the death penalty\nfor someone who could not be rehabilitated, App. 777, but the\nprosecutors did not question him further about this view. In sum,\nnonblack jurors whose remarks on rehabilitation could well have\nsignaled a limit on their willingness to impose a death sentence\nwere not questioned further and drew no objection, but the\nprosecution expressed apprehension about a black juror’s belief in\nthe possibility of reformation even though he repeatedly stated his\napproval of the death penalty and testified that he could impose it\naccording to state legal standards even when the alternative\nsentence of life imprisonment would give a defendant (like everyone\nelse in the world) the opportunity to reform.[ Footnote 5 ] The unlikelihood that his position on\nrehabilitation had anything to do with the peremptory strike of\nFields is underscored by the prosecution’s response after\nMiller-El’s lawyer pointed out that the prosecutor had\nmisrepresented Fields’s responses on the subject. A moment earlier\nthe prosecutor had finished his misdescription of Fields’s views on\npotential rehabilitation with the words, “Those are our reasons for\nexercising our … strike at this time.” Id. , at 197. When\ndefense counsel called him on his misstatement, he neither defended\nwhat he said nor withdrew the strike. Id. , at 198.\nInstead, he suddenly came up with Fields’s brother’s prior\nconviction as another reason for the strike. Id. , at\n199. It would be difficult to credit the State’s\nnew explanation, which reeks of afterthought. While the Court of\nAppeals tried to bolster it with the observation that no seated\njuror was in Fields’s position with respect to his brother, 361\nF. 3d, at 859–860, the court’s readiness to accept the State’s\nsubstitute reason ignores not only its pretextual timing but the\nother reasons rendering it implausible. Fields’s testimony\nindicated he was not close to his brother, App. 190 (“I don’t\nreally know too much about it”), and the prosecution asked nothing\nfurther about the influence his brother’s history might have had on\nFields, as it probably would have done if the family history had\nactually mattered. See, e.g., Ex parte Travis , 776\nSo. 2d 874, 881 (Ala. 2000) (“[T]he State’s failure to engage\nin any meaningful voir dire examination on a subject the State\nalleges it is concerned about is evidence suggesting that the\nexplanation is a sham and a pretext for discrimination”). There is\nno good reason to doubt that the State’s afterthought about\nFields’s brother was anything but makeweight. The Court of Appeals’s judgment on the Fields\nstrike is unsupportable for the same reason the State’s first\nexplanation is itself unsupportable. The Appeals Court’s\ndescription of Fields’s voir dire testimony mentioned only\nhis statements that everyone could be rehabilitated, failing to\nnote that Fields affirmed that he could give the death penalty if\nthe law and evidence called for it, regardless of the possibility\nof divine grace. The Court of Appeals made no mention of the fact\nthat the prosecution mischaracterized Fields as saying he could not\ngive death if rehabilitation were possible. 361 F. 3d, at\n856. In sum, when we look for nonblack jurors\nsimilarly situated to Fields, we find strong similarities as well\nas some differences.[ Footnote\n6 ] But the differences seem far from significant, particularly\nwhen we read Fields’s voir dire testimony in its entirety.\nUpon that reading, Fields should have been an ideal juror in the\neyes of a prosecutor seeking a death sentence, and the prosecutors’\nexplanations for the strike cannot reasonably be accepted. See Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U. S., at 339 (the\ncredibility of reasons given can be m",

    "fulltext": "SYLLABUS OCTOBER TERM, 2004 MILLER-EL V. DRETKE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES MILLER-EL v. DRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS\nDEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS\nDIVISION certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the fifth circuit No. 03–9659.Argued December 6, 2004—Decided June\n13, 2005 When Dallas County prosecutors used peremptory\nstrikes against 10 of the 11 qualified black venire members during\njury selection for petitioner Miller-El’s capital murder trial, he\nobjected, claiming that the strikes were based on race and could\nnot be presumed legitimate since the District Attorney’s Office had\na history of excluding blacks from criminal juries. The trial court\ndenied his request for a new jury, and his trial ended with a death\nsentence. While his appeal was pending, this Court decided, in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 , that\ndiscrimination by a prosecutor in selecting a defendant’s jury\nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment. On remand, the trial court\nreviewed the voir dire record, heard prosecutor Macaluso’s\njustifications for the strikes that were not explained during voir dire , and found no showing that prospective black\njurors were struck because of their race. The State Court of\nCriminal Appeals affirmed. Subsequently, the Federal District Court\ndenied Miller-El federal habeas relief, and the Fifth Circuit\ndenied a certificate of appealability. This Court reversed, finding\nthat the merits of Miller-El’s Batson claim were, at\nleast, debatable by jurists of reason. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322 . The Fifth\nCircuit granted a certificate of appealability but rejected\nMiller-El’s Batson claim on the merits. Held: Miller-El is entitled to\nprevail on his Batson claim and, thus, entitled to habeas\nrelief. Pp. 3–33. (a) “[T]his Court\nconsistently and repeatedly has reaffirmed that racial\ndiscrimination by the State in jury selection offends the Equal\nProtection Clause.” Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42 , 44. The rub\nhas been the practical difficulty of ferreting out discrimination\nin selections discretionary by nature and subject to a myriad of\nlegitimate influences. The Batson Court held that a\ndefendant can make out a prima facie case of discriminatory jury\nselection by “the totality of the relevant facts” about a\nprosecutor’s conduct during the defendant’s own trial. 476 U. S.,\nat 94. Once that showing is made, the burden shifts to the State to\ncome forward with a neutral explanation, id., at 97, and\nthe trial court must determine if the defendant has shown\n“purposeful discrimination,” id., at 98, in light of “all\nrelevant circumstances,” id. , at 96–97. Since this case is\non review of a denial of habeas relief under 28 U. S. C.\n§2254, and since the Texas trial court’s prior determination that\nthe State’s race-neutral explanations were true is a factual\ndetermination, Miller-El may obtain relief only by showing the\ntrial court’s conclusion to be “an unreasonable determination of\nthe facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding,” §2254(e)(1). Pp. 3–6. (b) The prosecutors used peremptory\nstrikes to exclude 91% of the eligible black venire panelists, a\ndisparity unlikely to have been produced by happenstance. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. at 342. More\npowerful than the bare statistics are side-by-side comparisons of\nsome black venire panelists who were struck and white ones who were\nnot. If a prosecutor’s proffered reason for striking a black\npanelist applies just as well to a white panelist allowed to serve,\nthat is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination. The\ndetails of two panel member comparisons bear out this Court’s\nobservation, id., at 343, that the prosecution’s reason\nfor exercising peremptory strikes against some black panel members\nappeared to apply equally to some white jurors. There are strong\nsimilarities and some differences between Billy Jean Fields, a\nblack venireman who expressed unwavering support for the death\npenalty but was struck, and similarly situated nonblack jurors; but\nthe differences seem far from significant, particularly when\nreading Fields’s voir dire testimony in its entirety. Upon\nthat reading, Fields should have been an ideal juror in the eyes of\na prosecutor seeking a death sentence, and the prosecutors’\nexplanations for the strike, that Fields would not vote for death\nif rehabilitation were possible, a mischaracterization of his\ntestimony, cannot reasonably be accepted when there were nonblack\nveniremen expressing comparable views on rehabilitation who were\nnot struck. The prosecution’s reason that Fields’s brother had\nprior convictions is not creditable in light of its failure to\nenquire about the matter. The prosecution’s proffered reasons for\nstriking Joe Warren, another black venireman, are comparably\nunlikely. The fact that the reason for striking him, that he\nthought death was an easy way out and defendants should be made to\nsuffer more, also applied to nonblack panel members who were\nselected is evidence of pretext. The suggestion of pretext is not,\nmoreover, mitigated by Macaluso’s explanation that Warren was\nstruck when the State could afford to be liberal in using its 10\nremaining peremptory challenges. Were that the explanation for\nstriking Warren and later accepting similar panel members,\nprosecutors would have struck white panel member Jenkins, who was\nexamined and accepted before Warren despite her similar views.\nMacaluso’s explanation also weakens any suggestion that the State’s\nacceptance of Woods, the one black juror, shows that race was not\nin play. When he was selected as the eighth juror, the State had\nused 11 of its 15 peremptory challenges, 7 on black panel members;\nand the record shows that at least 3 of the remaining venire panel\nopposed capital punishment. Because the prosecutors had to exercise\nprudent restraint, the late-stage decision to accept a black panel\nmember willing to impose the death penalty does not neutralize the\nearly-stage decision to challenge a comparable venireman, Warren.\nThe Fifth Circuit’s substituted reason for the elimination,\nWarren’s general ambivalence about the penalty, was erroneous as a\nmatter of fact and law. As to fact, Macaluso said nothing about\ngeneral ambivalence, and Warren’s answer to several questions was\nthat he could impose the death penalty. As for law, the Batson rule provides the prosecutor an opportunity to give\nthe reason for striking a juror and requires the judge to assess\nthe reason’s plausibility in light of all of the evidence, but it\ndoes not does not call for a mere exercise in thinking up any\nrational basis. Because a prosecutor is responsible for the reason\nhe gave, the Fifth Circuit’s substitution of a reason for excluding\nWarren does nothing to satisfy the prosecutors’ burden of stating a\nracially neutral explanation for their own actions. Comparing\nWarren’s strike with the treatment of panel members with similar\nviews supports a conclusion that race was significant in\ndetermining who was challenged and who was not. Pp. 6–19. (c) The prosecution’s broader patterns of\npractice during jury selection also support the case for\ndiscrimination. Texas law permits either side to shuffle the cards\nbearing panel member names to rearrange the order in which they are\nquestioned. Members seated in the back may escape voir\ndire , for those not questioned by the end of each week are\ndismissed. Here, the prosecution shuffled the cards when a number\nof black members were seated at the front of the panel at the\nbeginning of the second week. The third week, they shuffled when\nthe first four members were black, placing them in the back. After\nthe defense reshuffled the cards, and the black members reappeared\nin the front, the court denied the prosecution’s request for\nanother shuffle. No racially neutral reason for the shuffling has\never been offered, and nothing stops the suspicion of\ndiscriminatory intent from rising to an inference. The contrasting voir dire questions posed respectively to black and\nnonblack panel members also indicate that the State was trying to\navoid black jurors. Prosecutors gave a bland description of the\ndeath penalty to 94% of white venire panel members before asking\nabout the individual’s feelings on the subject, but used a script\ndescribing imposition of the death penalty in graphic terms for 53%\nof the black venire members. The argument that prosecutors used the\ngraphic script to weed out ambivalent panel members simply does not\nfit the facts. Black venire members were more likely to receive\nthat script regardless of their expressions of certainty or\nambivalence about the death penalty, and the State’s chosen\nexplanation failed for four out of the eight black panel members\nwho received it: two received it after clearly stating their\nopposition to the death penalty and two received it even though\nthey unambiguously favored that penalty. The State’s explanation\nmisses the mark four out of five times with regard to the nonblacks\nwho received the graphic description. Ambivalent black panel\nmembers were also more likely to receive the graphic script than\nnonblack ambivalent ones. The State’s attempt at a race-neutral\nrationalization fails to explain what the prosecutors did. The\nexplanation that the prosecutors’ first object was to use the\ngraphic script to make a case for excluding black panel members\nopposed to, or ambivalent about, the death penalty is more\npersuasive than the State’s explanation, and the reasonable\ninference is that race was the major consideration when the\nprosecution chose to follow the graphic script. The same is true\nfor another kind of disparate questioning. The prosecutors asked\nall black panel members opposed to, or ambivalent about, the death\npenalty how low a sentence they would consider imposing for murder\nwithout telling them that the State requires a 5-year minimum, but\nprosecutors did not put that question to most white panel members\nwho had expressed similar views. The final body of evidence\nconfirming the conclusion here is that the Dallas County District\nAttorney’s Office had, for decades, followed a specific policy of\nsystematically excluding blacks from juries. The Miller-El\nprosecutors’ notes of the race of each panel member show that they\ntook direction from a jury selection manual that included racial\nstereotypes. Pp. 19–31. (d) The Fifth Circuit’s conclusion that\nMiller-El failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the\nstate court’s no-discrimination finding was wrong is as\nunsupportable as the “dismissive and strained interpretation” of\nhis evidence that this Court disapproved when deciding that he was\nentitled to a certificate of appealability, Miller-El, supra, at 344. Ten of the eleven black venire members were\nperemptorily struck. At least two of them were ostensibly\nacceptable to prosecutors seeking the death penalty. The\nprosecutors’ chosen race-neutral reasons for the strikes do not\nhold up and are so far at odds with the evidence that pretext is\nthe fair conclusion. The selection process was replete with\nevidence that prosecutors were selecting and rejecting potential\njurors because of race. And the prosecutors took their cues from a\nmanual on jury selection with an emphasis on race. It blinks\nreality to deny that the State struck Fields and Warren because\nthey were black. The facts correlate to nothing as well as to race.\nThe state court’s contrary conclusion was unreasonable as well as\nerroneous. Pp. 32–33. 361 F. 3d 849, reversed and remanded. Souter, J., delivered the opinion\nof the Court, in which Stevens, O’Connor, Kennedy, Ginsburg, and\nBreyer, JJ., joined. Breyer, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nThomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist,\nC. J., and Scalia, J., joined. OPINION OF THE COURT MILLER-EL V. DRETKE 545 U. S. ____ (2005) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 03-9659 THOMAS JOE MILLER-EL, PETITIONER v. DOUG\nDRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE,\nCORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit [June 13, 2005] Justice Souter delivered the\nopinion of the Court. Two years ago, we ordered that a\ncertificate of appealability, under 28 U. S. C. §2253(c), be\nissued to habeas petitioner Miller-El, affording review of the\nDistrict Court’s rejection of the claim that prosecutors in his\ncapital murder trial made peremptory strikes of potential jurors\nbased on race. Today we find Miller-El entitled to prevail on that\nclaim and order relief under §2254. I In the course of robbing a\nHoliday Inn in Dallas, Texas in late 1985, Miller-El and his\naccomplices bound and gagged two hotel employees, whom Miller-El\nthen shot, killing one and severely injuring the other. During jury\nselection in Miller-El’s trial for capital murder, prosecutors used\nperemptory strikes against 10 qualified black venire members.\nMiller-El objected that the strikes were based on race and could\nnot be presumed legitimate, given a history of excluding black\nmembers from criminal juries by the Dallas County District\nAttorney’s Office. The trial court received evidence of the\npractice alleged but found no “systematic exclusion of blacks as a\nmatter of policy” by that office, App. 882–883, and therefore no\nentitlement to relief under Swain v. Alabama , 380 U. S. 202 (1965), the case then defining and marking the limits of relief\nfrom racially biased jury selection. The court denied Miller-El’s\nrequest to pick a new jury, and the trial ended with his death\nsentence for capital murder. While an appeal was pending, this\nCourt decided Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986), which replaced Swain ’s threshold requirement to prove systemic\ndiscrimination under a Fourteenth Amendment jury claim, with the\nrule that discrimination by the prosecutor in selecting the\ndefendant’s jury sufficed to establish the constitutional\nviolation. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals then remanded the\nmatter to the trial court to determine whether Miller-El could show\nthat prosecutors in his case peremptorily struck prospective black\njurors because of race. Miller-El v. State , 748\nS. W. 2d 459 (1988). The trial court found no such demonstration.\nAfter reviewing the voir dire record of the explanations\ngiven for some of the challenged strikes, and after hearing one of\nthe prosecutors, Paul Macaluso, give his justification for those\npreviously unexplained, the trial court accepted the stated\nrace-neutral reasons for the strikes, which the judge called\n“completely credible [and] sufficient” as the grounds for a finding\nof “no purposeful discrimination.” Findings of Fact and Conclusions\nof Law Upon Remand from the Court of Criminal Appeals in State v. Miller-El, No. 8668–NL (5th Crim. Dist.\nCt., Dallas County, Tex., Jan. 13, 1989), pp. 5–6, App.\n928–929. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, stating it found\n“ample support” in the voir dire record for the\nrace-neutral explanations offered by prosecutors for the peremptory\nstrikes. Miller-El v. State, No. 69,677 (Sept.\n16, 1992) (per curiam) , p. 2, App. 931. Miller-El then sought habeas relief under 28\nU. S. C. §2254, again pressing his Batson claim,\namong others not now before us. The District Court denied relief, Miller-El v. Johnson , Civil No. 3:96–CV–1992–H\n(ND Tex., June 5, 2000), App. 987, and the Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit precluded appeal by denying a certificate of\nappealability, Miller-El v. Johnson, 261\nF. 3d 445 (2001). We granted certiorari to consider whether\nMiller-El was entitled to review on the Batson claim, Miller-El v. Cockrell, 534 U. S. 1122 (2002),\nand reversed the Court of Appeals. After examining the record of\nMiller-El’s extensive evidence of purposeful discrimination by the\nDallas County District Attorney’s Office before and during his\ntrial, we found an appeal was in order, since the merits of the Batson claim were, at the least, debatable by jurists of\nreason. Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U. S. 322 (2003). After granting a\ncertificate of appealability, the Fifth Circuit rejected\nMiller-El’s Batson claim on the merits. 361 F. 3d 849\n(2004). We again granted certiorari, 542 U. S. 936 (2004),\nand again we reverse. II A “It is well known that prejudices\noften exist against particular classes in the community, which sway\nthe judgment of jurors, and which, therefore, operate in some cases\nto deny to persons of those classes the full enjoyment of that\nprotection which others enjoy.” Strauder v. West\nVirginia , 100\nU. S. 303 , 309 (1880); see also Batson v. Kentucky , supra , at 86. Defendants are harmed, of\ncourse, when racial discrimination in jury selection compromises\nthe right of trial by impartial jury, Strauder v. West\nVirginia , supra , at 308, but racial minorities are\nharmed more generally, for prosecutors drawing racial lines in\npicking juries establish “state-sponsored group stereotypes rooted\nin, and reflective of, historical prejudice,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127 ,\n128 (1994). Nor is the harm confined to\nminorities. When the government’s choice of jurors is tainted with\nracial bias, that “overt wrong … casts doubt over the obligation of\nthe parties, the jury, and indeed the court to adhere to the law\nthroughout the trial … .” Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S. 400 ,\n412 (1991). That is, the very integrity of the courts is\njeopardized when a prosecutor’s discrimination “invites cynicism\nrespecting the jury’s neutrality,” id. , at 412, and\nundermines public confidence in adjudication, Georgia v. McCollum , 505 U. S. 42 , 49 (1992); Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co. , 500 U. S. 614 , 628\n(1991); Batson v. Kentucky , supra, at\n87. So, “[f]or more than a century, this Court consistently and\nrepeatedly has reaffirmed that racial discrimination by the State\nin jury selection offends the Equal Protection Clause.” Georgia v. McCollum , supra , at 44; see Strauder v. West Virginia , supra , at\n308, 310; Norris v. Alabama , 294 U. S. 587 , 596 (1935); Swain v. Alabama , supra, at 223–224; Batson v. Kentucky , supra , at 84; Powers v. Ohio , supra , at 404. The rub has been the practical difficulty of\nferreting out discrimination in selections discretionary by nature,\nand choices subject to myriad legitimate influences, whatever the\nrace of the individuals on the panel from which jurors are\nselected. In Swain v. Alabama , we tackled the\nproblem of “the quantum of proof necessary” to show purposeful\ndiscrimination, 380 U. S., at 205, with an eye to preserving each\nside’s historical prerogative to make a peremptory strike or\nchallenge, the very nature of which is traditionally “without a\nreason stated,” id. , at 220. The Swain Court\ntried to relate peremptory challenge to equal protection by\npresuming the legitimacy of prosecutors’ strikes except in the face\nof a longstanding pattern of discrimination: when “in case after\ncase, whatever the circumstances,” no blacks served on juries, then\n“giving even the widest leeway to the operation of irrational but\ntrial-related suspicions and antagonisms, it would appear that the\npurposes of the peremptory challenge [were] being perverted.” Id. , at 223–224. Swain ’s demand to make out a\ncontinuity of discrimination over time, however, turned out to be\ndifficult to the point of unworkable, and in Batson v. Kentucky , we recognized that this requirement to show an\nextended pattern imposed a “crippling burden of proof” that left\nprosecutors’ use of peremptories “largely immune from\nconstitutional scrutiny.” 476 U. S., at 92–93. By Batson ’s\nday, the law implementing equal protection elsewhere had evolved\ninto less discouraging standards for assessing a claim of\npurposeful discrimination, id. , at 93–95 (citing, e.g. , Washington v. Davis , 426 U. S. 229 (1976),\nand Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing\nDevelopment Corp. , 429 U. S. 252 (1977)),\nand we accordingly held that a defendant could make out a prima\nfacie case of discriminatory jury selection by “the totality of the\nrelevant facts” about a prosecutor’s conduct during the defendant’s\nown trial. Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S., at 94,\n96. “Once the defendant makes a prima facie showing, the burden\nshifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation for\nchallenging … jurors” within an arguably targeted class. Id. , at 97. Although there may be “any number of bases on\nwhich a prosecutor reasonably [might] believe that it is desirable\nto strike a juror who is not excusable for cause … , the\nprosecutor must give a clear and reasonably specific explanation of\nhis legitimate reasons for exercising the challeng[e].” Id. , at 98, n. 20 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n“The trial court then will have the duty to determine if the\ndefendant has established purposeful discrimination.” Id. ,\nat 98. Although the move from Swain to Batson left a defendant free to challenge the prosecution\nwithout having to cast Swain ’s wide net, the net was not\nentirely consigned to history, for Batson ’s individualized\nfocus came with a weakness of its own owing to its very emphasis on\nthe particular reasons a prosecutor might give. If any facially\nneutral reason sufficed to answer a Batson challenge, then Batson would not amount to much more than Swain .\nSome stated reasons are false, and although some false reasons are\nshown up within the four corners of a given case, sometimes a court\nmay not be sure unless it looks beyond the case at hand. Hence Batson ’s explanation that a defendant may rely on “all\nrelevant circumstances” to raise an inference of purposeful\ndiscrimination. 476 U. S., at 96–97. B This case comes to us on review\nof a denial of habeas relief sought under 28 U. S. C. §2254,\nfollowing the Texas trial court’s prior determination of fact that\nthe State’s race-neutral explanations were true, see Purkett v. Elem , 514 U. S. 765 , 769\n(1995) (per curiam); Batson v. Kentucky , supra , at 98, n. 21. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996, Miller-El may obtain relief only by showing\nthe Texas conclusion to be “an unreasonable determination of the\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2). Thus we presume the\nTexas court’s factual findings to be sound unless Miller-El rebuts\nthe “presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.”\n§2254(e)(1). The standard is demanding but not insatiable; as we\nsaid the last time this case was here, “[d]eference does not by\ndefinition preclude relief.” Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U. S., at 340. III A The numbers describing the\nprosecution’s use of peremptories are remarkable. Out of 20 black\nmembers of the 108-person venire panel for Miller-El’s trial, only\n1 served. Although 9 were excused for cause or by agreement, 10\nwere peremptorily struck by the prosecution. Id. , at 331.\n“The prosecutors used their peremptory strikes to exclude 91% of\nthe eligible African-American venire members … . Happenstance\nis unlikely to produce this disparity.” Id. , at 342. More powerful than these bare\nstatistics, however, are side-by-side comparisons of some black\nvenire panelists who were struck and white panelists allowed to\nserve. If a prosecutor’s proffered reason for striking a black\npanelist applies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack who\nis permitted to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful\ndiscrimination to be considered at Batson ’s third step.\nCf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc. , 530 U. S. 133 ,\n147 (2000) (in employment discrimination cases, “[p]roof that the\ndefendant’s explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form\nof circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional\ndiscrimination, and it may be quite persuasive”). While we did not\ndevelop a comparative juror analysis last time, we did note that\nthe prosecution’s reasons for exercising peremptory strikes against\nsome black panel members appeared equally on point as to some white\njurors who served. Miller-El v. Cockrell , supra , at 343.[ Footnote\n1 ] The details of two panel member comparisons bear this\nout.[ Footnote 2 ] The prosecution used its second peremptory\nstrike to exclude Billy Jean Fields, a black man who expressed\nunwavering support for the death penalty. On the questionnaire\nfilled out by all panel members before individual examination on\nthe stand, Fields said that he believed in capital punishment,\nJoint Lodging 14, and during questioning he disclosed his belief\nthat the State acts on God’s behalf when it imposes the death\npenalty. “Therefore, if the State exacts death, then that’s what it\nshould be.” App. 174. He testified that he had no religious or\nphilosophical reservations about the death penalty and that the\ndeath penalty deterred crime. Id. , at 174–175. He twice\naverred, without apparent hesitation, that he could sit on\nMiller-El’s jury and make a decision to impose this penalty. Id. , at 176–177. Although at one point in the questioning,\nFields indicated that the possibility of rehabilitation might be\nrelevant to the likelihood that a defendant would commit future\nacts of violence, id. , at 183, he responded to ensuing\nquestions by saying that although he believed anyone could be\nrehabilitated, this belief would not stand in the way of a decision\nto impose the death penalty: “[B]ased on what you [the prosecutor] said as far\nas the crime goes, there are only two things that could be\nrendered, death or life in prison. If for some reason the testimony\ndidn’t warrant death, then life imprisonment would give an\nindividual an opportunity to rehabilitate. But, you know, you said\nthat the jurors didn’t have the opportunity to make a personal\ndecision in the matter with reference to what I thought or felt,\nbut it was just based on the questions according to the way the law\nhas been handed down.” Id. , at 185 (alteration\nomitted). Fields also noted on his\nquestionnaire that his brother had a criminal history. Joint\nLodging 13. During questioning, the prosecution went into this,\ntoo: “Q   Could you tell me a little bit\nabout that? “A   He was arrested and convicted on [a] number\nof occasions for possession of a controlled substance. “Q   Was that here in Dallas? “A   Yes. “Q   Was he involved in any trials or anything\nlike that? “A   I suppose of sorts. I don’t really know too\nmuch about it. “Q   Was he ever convicted? “A   Yeah, he served time. “Q   Do you feel that that would in any way\ninterfere with your service on this jury at all? “A   No.” App. 190. Fields was struck peremptorily by\nthe prosecution, with prosecutor James Nelson offering a\nrace-neutral reason: “[W]e … have concern with reference to some of his\nstatements as to the death penalty in that he said that he could\nonly give death if he thought a person could not be rehabilitated\nand he later made the comment that any person could be\nrehabilitated if they find God or are introduced to God and the\nfact that we have a concern that his religious feelings may affect\nhis jury service in this case.” Id. , at 197 (alteration\nomitted). Thus, Nelson simply\nmischaracterized Fields’s testimony. He represented that Fields\nsaid he would not vote for death if rehabilitation was possible,\nwhereas Fields unequivocally stated that he could impose the death\npenalty regardless of the possibility of rehabilitation. Perhaps\nNelson misunderstood, but unless he had an ulterior reason for\nkeeping Fields off the jury we think he would have proceeded\ndifferently. In light of Fields’s outspoken support for the death\npenalty, we expect the prosecutor would have cleared up any\nmisunderstanding by asking further questions before getting to the\npoint of exercising a strike. If, indeed, Fields’s thoughts on\nrehabilitation did make the prosecutor uneasy, he should have\nworried about a number of white panel members he accepted with no\nevident reservations. Sandra Hearn said that she believed in the\ndeath penalty “if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated and continues\nto commit the same type of crime.” Id. , at 429.[ Footnote 3 ] Hearn went so far as to\nexpress doubt that at the penalty phase of a capital case she could\nconclude that a convicted murderer “would probably commit some\ncriminal acts of violence in the future.” Id. , at 440.\n“People change,” she said, making it hard to assess the risk of\nsomeone’s future dangerousness. “[T]he evidence would have to be\nawful strong.” Ibid . But the prosecution did not respond\nto Hearn the way it did to Fields, and without delving into her\nviews about rehabilitation with any further question, it raised no\nobjection to her serving on the jury. White panelist Mary Witt said\nshe would take the possibility of rehabilitation into account in\ndeciding at the penalty phase of the trial about a defendant’s\nprobability of future dangerousness, 6 Record of Voir Dire 2433 (hereinafter Record), but the prosecutors asked her no further\nquestion about her views on reformation, and they accepted her as a\njuror. Id. , at 2464–2465.[ Footnote 4 ] Latino venireman Fernando Gutierrez, who\nserved on the jury, said that he would consider the death penalty\nfor someone who could not be rehabilitated, App. 777, but the\nprosecutors did not question him further about this view. In sum,\nnonblack jurors whose remarks on rehabilitation could well have\nsignaled a limit on their willingness to impose a death sentence\nwere not questioned further and drew no objection, but the\nprosecution expressed apprehension about a black juror’s belief in\nthe possibility of reformation even though he repeatedly stated his\napproval of the death penalty and testified that he could impose it\naccording to state legal standards even when the alternative\nsentence of life imprisonment would give a defendant (like everyone\nelse in the world) the opportunity to reform.[ Footnote 5 ] The unlikelihood that his position on\nrehabilitation had anything to do with the peremptory strike of\nFields is underscored by the prosecution’s response after\nMiller-El’s lawyer pointed out that the prosecutor had\nmisrepresented Fields’s responses on the subject. A moment earlier\nthe prosecutor had finished his misdescription of Fields’s views on\npotential rehabilitation with the words, “Those are our reasons for\nexercising our … strike at this time.” Id. , at 197. When\ndefense counsel called him on his misstatement, he neither defended\nwhat he said nor withdrew the strike. Id. , at 198.\nInstead, he suddenly came up with Fields’s brother’s prior\nconviction as another reason for the strike. Id. , at\n199. It would be difficult to credit the State’s\nnew explanation, which reeks of afterthought. While the Court of\nAppeals tried to bolster it with the observation that no seated\njuror was in Fields’s position with respect to his brother, 361\nF. 3d, at 859–860, the court’s readiness to accept the State’s\nsubstitute reason ignores not only its pretextual timing but the\nother reasons rendering it implausible. Fields’s testimony\nindicated he was not close to his brother, App. 190 (“I don’t\nreally know too much about it”), and the prosecution asked nothing\nfurther about the influence his brother’s history might have had on\nFields, as it probably would have done if the family history had\nactually mattered. See, e.g., Ex parte Travis , 776\nSo. 2d 874, 881 (Ala. 2000) (“[T]he State’s failure to engage\nin any meaningful voir dire examination on a subject the State\nalleges it is concerned about is evidence suggesting that the\nexplanation is a sham and a pretext for discrimination”). There is\nno good reason to doubt that the State’s afterthought about\nFields’s brother was anything but makeweight. The Court of Appeals’s judgment on the Fields\nstrike is unsupportable for the same reason the State’s first\nexplanation is itself unsupportable. The Appeals Court’s\ndescription of Fields’s voir dire testimony mentioned only\nhis statements that everyone could be rehabilitated, failing to\nnote that Fields affirmed that he could give the death penalty if\nthe law and evidence called for it, regardless of the possibility\nof divine grace. The Court of Appeals made no mention of the fact\nthat the prosecution mischaracterized Fields as saying he could not\ngive death if rehabilitation were possible. 361 F. 3d, at\n856. In sum, when we look for nonblack jurors\nsimilarly situated to Fields, we find strong similarities as well\nas some differences.[ Footnote\n6 ] But the differences seem far from significant, particularly\nwhen we read Fields’s voir dire testimony in its entirety.\nUpon that reading, Fields should have been an ideal juror in the\neyes of a prosecutor seeking a death sentence, and the prosecutors’\nexplanations for the strike cannot reasonably be accepted. See Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U. S., at 339 (the\ncredibility of reasons given can be m",

    "fulltext": "SYLLABUS OCTOBER TERM, 2004 MILLER-EL V. DRETKE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES MILLER-EL v. DRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS\nDEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS\nDIVISION certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the fifth circuit No. 03–9659.Argued December 6, 2004—Decided June\n13, 2005 When Dallas County prosecutors used peremptory\nstrikes against 10 of the 11 qualified black venire members during\njury selection for petitioner Miller-El’s capital murder trial, he\nobjected, claiming that the strikes were based on race and could\nnot be presumed legitimate since the District Attorney’s Office had\na history of excluding blacks from criminal juries. The trial court\ndenied his request for a new jury, and his trial ended with a death\nsentence. While his appeal was pending, this Court decided, in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 , that\ndiscrimination by a prosecutor in selecting a defendant’s jury\nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment. On remand, the trial court\nreviewed the voir dire record, heard prosecutor Macaluso’s\njustifications for the strikes that were not explained during voir dire , and found no showing that prospective black\njurors were struck because of their race. The State Court of\nCriminal Appeals affirmed. Subsequently, the Federal District Court\ndenied Miller-El federal habeas relief, and the Fifth Circuit\ndenied a certificate of appealability. This Court reversed, finding\nthat the merits of Miller-El’s Batson claim were, at\nleast, debatable by jurists of reason. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322 . The Fifth\nCircuit granted a certificate of appealability but rejected\nMiller-El’s Batson claim on the merits. Held: Miller-El is entitled to\nprevail on his Batson claim and, thus, entitled to habeas\nrelief. Pp. 3–33. (a) “[T]his Court\nconsistently and repeatedly has reaffirmed that racial\ndiscrimination by the State in jury selection offends the Equal\nProtection Clause.” Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42 , 44. The rub\nhas been the practical difficulty of ferreting out discrimination\nin selections discretionary by nature and subject to a myriad of\nlegitimate influences. The Batson Court held that a\ndefendant can make out a prima facie case of discriminatory jury\nselection by “the totality of the relevant facts” about a\nprosecutor’s conduct during the defendant’s own trial. 476 U. S.,\nat 94. Once that showing is made, the burden shifts to the State to\ncome forward with a neutral explanation, id., at 97, and\nthe trial court must determine if the defendant has shown\n“purposeful discrimination,” id., at 98, in light of “all\nrelevant circumstances,” id. , at 96–97. Since this case is\non review of a denial of habeas relief under 28 U. S. C.\n§2254, and since the Texas trial court’s prior determination that\nthe State’s race-neutral explanations were true is a factual\ndetermination, Miller-El may obtain relief only by showing the\ntrial court’s conclusion to be “an unreasonable determination of\nthe facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding,” §2254(e)(1). Pp. 3–6. (b) The prosecutors used peremptory\nstrikes to exclude 91% of the eligible black venire panelists, a\ndisparity unlikely to have been produced by happenstance. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. at 342. More\npowerful than the bare statistics are side-by-side comparisons of\nsome black venire panelists who were struck and white ones who were\nnot. If a prosecutor’s proffered reason for striking a black\npanelist applies just as well to a white panelist allowed to serve,\nthat is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination. The\ndetails of two panel member comparisons bear out this Court’s\nobservation, id., at 343, that the prosecution’s reason\nfor exercising peremptory strikes against some black panel members\nappeared to apply equally to some white jurors. There are strong\nsimilarities and some differences between Billy Jean Fields, a\nblack venireman who expressed unwavering support for the death\npenalty but was struck, and similarly situated nonblack jurors; but\nthe differences seem far from significant, particularly when\nreading Fields’s voir dire testimony in its entirety. Upon\nthat reading, Fields should have been an ideal juror in the eyes of\na prosecutor seeking a death sentence, and the prosecutors’\nexplanations for the strike, that Fields would not vote for death\nif rehabilitation were possible, a mischaracterization of his\ntestimony, cannot reasonably be accepted when there were nonblack\nveniremen expressing comparable views on rehabilitation who were\nnot struck. The prosecution’s reason that Fields’s brother had\nprior convictions is not creditable in light of its failure to\nenquire about the matter. The prosecution’s proffered reasons for\nstriking Joe Warren, another black venireman, are comparably\nunlikely. The fact that the reason for striking him, that he\nthought death was an easy way out and defendants should be made to\nsuffer more, also applied to nonblack panel members who were\nselected is evidence of pretext. The suggestion of pretext is not,\nmoreover, mitigated by Macaluso’s explanation that Warren was\nstruck when the State could afford to be liberal in using its 10\nremaining peremptory challenges. Were that the explanation for\nstriking Warren and later accepting similar panel members,\nprosecutors would have struck white panel member Jenkins, who was\nexamined and accepted before Warren despite her similar views.\nMacaluso’s explanation also weakens any suggestion that the State’s\nacceptance of Woods, the one black juror, shows that race was not\nin play. When he was selected as the eighth juror, the State had\nused 11 of its 15 peremptory challenges, 7 on black panel members;\nand the record shows that at least 3 of the remaining venire panel\nopposed capital punishment. Because the prosecutors had to exercise\nprudent restraint, the late-stage decision to accept a black panel\nmember willing to impose the death penalty does not neutralize the\nearly-stage decision to challenge a comparable venireman, Warren.\nThe Fifth Circuit’s substituted reason for the elimination,\nWarren’s general ambivalence about the penalty, was erroneous as a\nmatter of fact and law. As to fact, Macaluso said nothing about\ngeneral ambivalence, and Warren’s answer to several questions was\nthat he could impose the death penalty. As for law, the Batson rule provides the prosecutor an opportunity to give\nthe reason for striking a juror and requires the judge to assess\nthe reason’s plausibility in light of all of the evidence, but it\ndoes not does not call for a mere exercise in thinking up any\nrational basis. Because a prosecutor is responsible for the reason\nhe gave, the Fifth Circuit’s substitution of a reason for excluding\nWarren does nothing to satisfy the prosecutors’ burden of stating a\nracially neutral explanation for their own actions. Comparing\nWarren’s strike with the treatment of panel members with similar\nviews supports a conclusion that race was significant in\ndetermining who was challenged and who was not. Pp. 6–19. (c) The prosecution’s broader patterns of\npractice during jury selection also support the case for\ndiscrimination. Texas law permits either side to shuffle the cards\nbearing panel member names to rearrange the order in which they are\nquestioned. Members seated in the back may escape voir\ndire , for those not questioned by the end of each week are\ndismissed. Here, the prosecution shuffled the cards when a number\nof black members were seated at the front of the panel at the\nbeginning of the second week. The third week, they shuffled when\nthe first four members were black, placing them in the back. After\nthe defense reshuffled the cards, and the black members reappeared\nin the front, the court denied the prosecution’s request for\nanother shuffle. No racially neutral reason for the shuffling has\never been offered, and nothing stops the suspicion of\ndiscriminatory intent from rising to an inference. The contrasting voir dire questions posed respectively to black and\nnonblack panel members also indicate that the State was trying to\navoid black jurors. Prosecutors gave a bland description of the\ndeath penalty to 94% of white venire panel members before asking\nabout the individual’s feelings on the subject, but used a script\ndescribing imposition of the death penalty in graphic terms for 53%\nof the black venire members. The argument that prosecutors used the\ngraphic script to weed out ambivalent panel members simply does not\nfit the facts. Black venire members were more likely to receive\nthat script regardless of their expressions of certainty or\nambivalence about the death penalty, and the State’s chosen\nexplanation failed for four out of the eight black panel members\nwho received it: two received it after clearly stating their\nopposition to the death penalty and two received it even though\nthey unambiguously favored that penalty. The State’s explanation\nmisses the mark four out of five times with regard to the nonblacks\nwho received the graphic description. Ambivalent black panel\nmembers were also more likely to receive the graphic script than\nnonblack ambivalent ones. The State’s attempt at a race-neutral\nrationalization fails to explain what the prosecutors did. The\nexplanation that the prosecutors’ first object was to use the\ngraphic script to make a case for excluding black panel members\nopposed to, or ambivalent about, the death penalty is more\npersuasive than the State’s explanation, and the reasonable\ninference is that race was the major consideration when the\nprosecution chose to follow the graphic script. The same is true\nfor another kind of disparate questioning. The prosecutors asked\nall black panel members opposed to, or ambivalent about, the death\npenalty how low a sentence they would consider imposing for murder\nwithout telling them that the State requires a 5-year minimum, but\nprosecutors did not put that question to most white panel members\nwho had expressed similar views. The final body of evidence\nconfirming the conclusion here is that the Dallas County District\nAttorney’s Office had, for decades, followed a specific policy of\nsystematically excluding blacks from juries. The Miller-El\nprosecutors’ notes of the race of each panel member show that they\ntook direction from a jury selection manual that included racial\nstereotypes. Pp. 19–31. (d) The Fifth Circuit’s conclusion that\nMiller-El failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the\nstate court’s no-discrimination finding was wrong is as\nunsupportable as the “dismissive and strained interpretation” of\nhis evidence that this Court disapproved when deciding that he was\nentitled to a certificate of appealability, Miller-El, supra, at 344. Ten of the eleven black venire members were\nperemptorily struck. At least two of them were ostensibly\nacceptable to prosecutors seeking the death penalty. The\nprosecutors’ chosen race-neutral reasons for the strikes do not\nhold up and are so far at odds with the evidence that pretext is\nthe fair conclusion. The selection process was replete with\nevidence that prosecutors were selecting and rejecting potential\njurors because of race. And the prosecutors took their cues from a\nmanual on jury selection with an emphasis on race. It blinks\nreality to deny that the State struck Fields and Warren because\nthey were black. The facts correlate to nothing as well as to race.\nThe state court’s contrary conclusion was unreasonable as well as\nerroneous. Pp. 32–33. 361 F. 3d 849, reversed and remanded. Souter, J., delivered the opinion\nof the Court, in which Stevens, O’Connor, Kennedy, Ginsburg, and\nBreyer, JJ., joined. Breyer, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nThomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist,\nC. J., and Scalia, J., joined. OPINION OF THE COURT MILLER-EL V. DRETKE 545 U. S. ____ (2005) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 03-9659 THOMAS JOE MILLER-EL, PETITIONER v. DOUG\nDRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE,\nCORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit [June 13, 2005] Justice Souter delivered the\nopinion of the Court. Two years ago, we ordered that a\ncertificate of appealability, under 28 U. S. C. §2253(c), be\nissued to habeas petitioner Miller-El, affording review of the\nDistrict Court’s rejection of the claim that prosecutors in his\ncapital murder trial made peremptory strikes of potential jurors\nbased on race. Today we find Miller-El entitled to prevail on that\nclaim and order relief under §2254. I In the course of robbing a\nHoliday Inn in Dallas, Texas in late 1985, Miller-El and his\naccomplices bound and gagged two hotel employees, whom Miller-El\nthen shot, killing one and severely injuring the other. During jury\nselection in Miller-El’s trial for capital murder, prosecutors used\nperemptory strikes against 10 qualified black venire members.\nMiller-El objected that the strikes were based on race and could\nnot be presumed legitimate, given a history of excluding black\nmembers from criminal juries by the Dallas County District\nAttorney’s Office. The trial court received evidence of the\npractice alleged but found no “systematic exclusion of blacks as a\nmatter of policy” by that office, App. 882–883, and therefore no\nentitlement to relief under Swain v. Alabama , 380 U. S. 202 (1965), the case then defining and marking the limits of relief\nfrom racially biased jury selection. The court denied Miller-El’s\nrequest to pick a new jury, and the trial ended with his death\nsentence for capital murder. While an appeal was pending, this\nCourt decided Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986), which replaced Swain ’s threshold requirement to prove systemic\ndiscrimination under a Fourteenth Amendment jury claim, with the\nrule that discrimination by the prosecutor in selecting the\ndefendant’s jury sufficed to establish the constitutional\nviolation. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals then remanded the\nmatter to the trial court to determine whether Miller-El could show\nthat prosecutors in his case peremptorily struck prospective black\njurors because of race. Miller-El v. State , 748\nS. W. 2d 459 (1988). The trial court found no such demonstration.\nAfter reviewing the voir dire record of the explanations\ngiven for some of the challenged strikes, and after hearing one of\nthe prosecutors, Paul Macaluso, give his justification for those\npreviously unexplained, the trial court accepted the stated\nrace-neutral reasons for the strikes, which the judge called\n“completely credible [and] sufficient” as the grounds for a finding\nof “no purposeful discrimination.” Findings of Fact and Conclusions\nof Law Upon Remand from the Court of Criminal Appeals in State v. Miller-El, No. 8668–NL (5th Crim. Dist.\nCt., Dallas County, Tex., Jan. 13, 1989), pp. 5–6, App.\n928–929. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, stating it found\n“ample support” in the voir dire record for the\nrace-neutral explanations offered by prosecutors for the peremptory\nstrikes. Miller-El v. State, No. 69,677 (Sept.\n16, 1992) (per curiam) , p. 2, App. 931. Miller-El then sought habeas relief under 28\nU. S. C. §2254, again pressing his Batson claim,\namong others not now before us. The District Court denied relief, Miller-El v. Johnson , Civil No. 3:96–CV–1992–H\n(ND Tex., June 5, 2000), App. 987, and the Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit precluded appeal by denying a certificate of\nappealability, Miller-El v. Johnson, 261\nF. 3d 445 (2001). We granted certiorari to consider whether\nMiller-El was entitled to review on the Batson claim, Miller-El v. Cockrell, 534 U. S. 1122 (2002),\nand reversed the Court of Appeals. After examining the record of\nMiller-El’s extensive evidence of purposeful discrimination by the\nDallas County District Attorney’s Office before and during his\ntrial, we found an appeal was in order, since the merits of the Batson claim were, at the least, debatable by jurists of\nreason. Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U. S. 322 (2003). After granting a\ncertificate of appealability, the Fifth Circuit rejected\nMiller-El’s Batson claim on the merits. 361 F. 3d 849\n(2004). We again granted certiorari, 542 U. S. 936 (2004),\nand again we reverse. II A “It is well known that prejudices\noften exist against particular classes in the community, which sway\nthe judgment of jurors, and which, therefore, operate in some cases\nto deny to persons of those classes the full enjoyment of that\nprotection which others enjoy.” Strauder v. West\nVirginia , 100\nU. S. 303 , 309 (1880); see also Batson v. Kentucky , supra , at 86. Defendants are harmed, of\ncourse, when racial discrimination in jury selection compromises\nthe right of trial by impartial jury, Strauder v. West\nVirginia , supra , at 308, but racial minorities are\nharmed more generally, for prosecutors drawing racial lines in\npicking juries establish “state-sponsored group stereotypes rooted\nin, and reflective of, historical prejudice,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127 ,\n128 (1994). Nor is the harm confined to\nminorities. When the government’s choice of jurors is tainted with\nracial bias, that “overt wrong … casts doubt over the obligation of\nthe parties, the jury, and indeed the court to adhere to the law\nthroughout the trial … .” Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S. 400 ,\n412 (1991). That is, the very integrity of the courts is\njeopardized when a prosecutor’s discrimination “invites cynicism\nrespecting the jury’s neutrality,” id. , at 412, and\nundermines public confidence in adjudication, Georgia v. McCollum , 505 U. S. 42 , 49 (1992); Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co. , 500 U. S. 614 , 628\n(1991); Batson v. Kentucky , supra, at\n87. So, “[f]or more than a century, this Court consistently and\nrepeatedly has reaffirmed that racial discrimination by the State\nin jury selection offends the Equal Protection Clause.” Georgia v. McCollum , supra , at 44; see Strauder v. West Virginia , supra , at\n308, 310; Norris v. Alabama , 294 U. S. 587 , 596 (1935); Swain v. Alabama , supra, at 223–224; Batson v. Kentucky , supra , at 84; Powers v. Ohio , supra , at 404. The rub has been the practical difficulty of\nferreting out discrimination in selections discretionary by nature,\nand choices subject to myriad legitimate influences, whatever the\nrace of the individuals on the panel from which jurors are\nselected. In Swain v. Alabama , we tackled the\nproblem of “the quantum of proof necessary” to show purposeful\ndiscrimination, 380 U. S., at 205, with an eye to preserving each\nside’s historical prerogative to make a peremptory strike or\nchallenge, the very nature of which is traditionally “without a\nreason stated,” id. , at 220. The Swain Court\ntried to relate peremptory challenge to equal protection by\npresuming the legitimacy of prosecutors’ strikes except in the face\nof a longstanding pattern of discrimination: when “in case after\ncase, whatever the circumstances,” no blacks served on juries, then\n“giving even the widest leeway to the operation of irrational but\ntrial-related suspicions and antagonisms, it would appear that the\npurposes of the peremptory challenge [were] being perverted.” Id. , at 223–224. Swain ’s demand to make out a\ncontinuity of discrimination over time, however, turned out to be\ndifficult to the point of unworkable, and in Batson v. Kentucky , we recognized that this requirement to show an\nextended pattern imposed a “crippling burden of proof” that left\nprosecutors’ use of peremptories “largely immune from\nconstitutional scrutiny.” 476 U. S., at 92–93. By Batson ’s\nday, the law implementing equal protection elsewhere had evolved\ninto less discouraging standards for assessing a claim of\npurposeful discrimination, id. , at 93–95 (citing, e.g. , Washington v. Davis , 426 U. S. 229 (1976),\nand Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing\nDevelopment Corp. , 429 U. S. 252 (1977)),\nand we accordingly held that a defendant could make out a prima\nfacie case of discriminatory jury selection by “the totality of the\nrelevant facts” about a prosecutor’s conduct during the defendant’s\nown trial. Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S., at 94,\n96. “Once the defendant makes a prima facie showing, the burden\nshifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation for\nchallenging … jurors” within an arguably targeted class. Id. , at 97. Although there may be “any number of bases on\nwhich a prosecutor reasonably [might] believe that it is desirable\nto strike a juror who is not excusable for cause … , the\nprosecutor must give a clear and reasonably specific explanation of\nhis legitimate reasons for exercising the challeng[e].” Id. , at 98, n. 20 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n“The trial court then will have the duty to determine if the\ndefendant has established purposeful discrimination.” Id. ,\nat 98. Although the move from Swain to Batson left a defendant free to challenge the prosecution\nwithout having to cast Swain ’s wide net, the net was not\nentirely consigned to history, for Batson ’s individualized\nfocus came with a weakness of its own owing to its very emphasis on\nthe particular reasons a prosecutor might give. If any facially\nneutral reason sufficed to answer a Batson challenge, then Batson would not amount to much more than Swain .\nSome stated reasons are false, and although some false reasons are\nshown up within the four corners of a given case, sometimes a court\nmay not be sure unless it looks beyond the case at hand. Hence Batson ’s explanation that a defendant may rely on “all\nrelevant circumstances” to raise an inference of purposeful\ndiscrimination. 476 U. S., at 96–97. B This case comes to us on review\nof a denial of habeas relief sought under 28 U. S. C. §2254,\nfollowing the Texas trial court’s prior determination of fact that\nthe State’s race-neutral explanations were true, see Purkett v. Elem , 514 U. S. 765 , 769\n(1995) (per curiam); Batson v. Kentucky , supra , at 98, n. 21. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996, Miller-El may obtain relief only by showing\nthe Texas conclusion to be “an unreasonable determination of the\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2). Thus we presume the\nTexas court’s factual findings to be sound unless Miller-El rebuts\nthe “presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.”\n§2254(e)(1). The standard is demanding but not insatiable; as we\nsaid the last time this case was here, “[d]eference does not by\ndefinition preclude relief.” Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U. S., at 340. III A The numbers describing the\nprosecution’s use of peremptories are remarkable. Out of 20 black\nmembers of the 108-person venire panel for Miller-El’s trial, only\n1 served. Although 9 were excused for cause or by agreement, 10\nwere peremptorily struck by the prosecution. Id. , at 331.\n“The prosecutors used their peremptory strikes to exclude 91% of\nthe eligible African-American venire members … . Happenstance\nis unlikely to produce this disparity.” Id. , at 342. More powerful than these bare\nstatistics, however, are side-by-side comparisons of some black\nvenire panelists who were struck and white panelists allowed to\nserve. If a prosecutor’s proffered reason for striking a black\npanelist applies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack who\nis permitted to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful\ndiscrimination to be considered at Batson ’s third step.\nCf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc. , 530 U. S. 133 ,\n147 (2000) (in employment discrimination cases, “[p]roof that the\ndefendant’s explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form\nof circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional\ndiscrimination, and it may be quite persuasive”). While we did not\ndevelop a comparative juror analysis last time, we did note that\nthe prosecution’s reasons for exercising peremptory strikes against\nsome black panel members appeared equally on point as to some white\njurors who served. Miller-El v. Cockrell , supra , at 343.[ Footnote\n1 ] The details of two panel member comparisons bear this\nout.[ Footnote 2 ] The prosecution used its second peremptory\nstrike to exclude Billy Jean Fields, a black man who expressed\nunwavering support for the death penalty. On the questionnaire\nfilled out by all panel members before individual examination on\nthe stand, Fields said that he believed in capital punishment,\nJoint Lodging 14, and during questioning he disclosed his belief\nthat the State acts on God’s behalf when it imposes the death\npenalty. “Therefore, if the State exacts death, then that’s what it\nshould be.” App. 174. He testified that he had no religious or\nphilosophical reservations about the death penalty and that the\ndeath penalty deterred crime. Id. , at 174–175. He twice\naverred, without apparent hesitation, that he could sit on\nMiller-El’s jury and make a decision to impose this penalty. Id. , at 176–177. Although at one point in the questioning,\nFields indicated that the possibility of rehabilitation might be\nrelevant to the likelihood that a defendant would commit future\nacts of violence, id. , at 183, he responded to ensuing\nquestions by saying that although he believed anyone could be\nrehabilitated, this belief would not stand in the way of a decision\nto impose the death penalty: “[B]ased on what you [the prosecutor] said as far\nas the crime goes, there are only two things that could be\nrendered, death or life in prison. If for some reason the testimony\ndidn’t warrant death, then life imprisonment would give an\nindividual an opportunity to rehabilitate. But, you know, you said\nthat the jurors didn’t have the opportunity to make a personal\ndecision in the matter with reference to what I thought or felt,\nbut it was just based on the questions according to the way the law\nhas been handed down.” Id. , at 185 (alteration\nomitted). Fields also noted on his\nquestionnaire that his brother had a criminal history. Joint\nLodging 13. During questioning, the prosecution went into this,\ntoo: “Q   Could you tell me a little bit\nabout that? “A   He was arrested and convicted on [a] number\nof occasions for possession of a controlled substance. “Q   Was that here in Dallas? “A   Yes. “Q   Was he involved in any trials or anything\nlike that? “A   I suppose of sorts. I don’t really know too\nmuch about it. “Q   Was he ever convicted? “A   Yeah, he served time. “Q   Do you feel that that would in any way\ninterfere with your service on this jury at all? “A   No.” App. 190. Fields was struck peremptorily by\nthe prosecution, with prosecutor James Nelson offering a\nrace-neutral reason: “[W]e … have concern with reference to some of his\nstatements as to the death penalty in that he said that he could\nonly give death if he thought a person could not be rehabilitated\nand he later made the comment that any person could be\nrehabilitated if they find God or are introduced to God and the\nfact that we have a concern that his religious feelings may affect\nhis jury service in this case.” Id. , at 197 (alteration\nomitted). Thus, Nelson simply\nmischaracterized Fields’s testimony. He represented that Fields\nsaid he would not vote for death if rehabilitation was possible,\nwhereas Fields unequivocally stated that he could impose the death\npenalty regardless of the possibility of rehabilitation. Perhaps\nNelson misunderstood, but unless he had an ulterior reason for\nkeeping Fields off the jury we think he would have proceeded\ndifferently. In light of Fields’s outspoken support for the death\npenalty, we expect the prosecutor would have cleared up any\nmisunderstanding by asking further questions before getting to the\npoint of exercising a strike. If, indeed, Fields’s thoughts on\nrehabilitation did make the prosecutor uneasy, he should have\nworried about a number of white panel members he accepted with no\nevident reservations. Sandra Hearn said that she believed in the\ndeath penalty “if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated and continues\nto commit the same type of crime.” Id. , at 429.[ Footnote 3 ] Hearn went so far as to\nexpress doubt that at the penalty phase of a capital case she could\nconclude that a convicted murderer “would probably commit some\ncriminal acts of violence in the future.” Id. , at 440.\n“People change,” she said, making it hard to assess the risk of\nsomeone’s future dangerousness. “[T]he evidence would have to be\nawful strong.” Ibid . But the prosecution did not respond\nto Hearn the way it did to Fields, and without delving into her\nviews about rehabilitation with any further question, it raised no\nobjection to her serving on the jury. White panelist Mary Witt said\nshe would take the possibility of rehabilitation into account in\ndeciding at the penalty phase of the trial about a defendant’s\nprobability of future dangerousness, 6 Record of Voir Dire 2433 (hereinafter Record), but the prosecutors asked her no further\nquestion about her views on reformation, and they accepted her as a\njuror. Id. , at 2464–2465.[ Footnote 4 ] Latino venireman Fernando Gutierrez, who\nserved on the jury, said that he would consider the death penalty\nfor someone who could not be rehabilitated, App. 777, but the\nprosecutors did not question him further about this view. In sum,\nnonblack jurors whose remarks on rehabilitation could well have\nsignaled a limit on their willingness to impose a death sentence\nwere not questioned further and drew no objection, but the\nprosecution expressed apprehension about a black juror’s belief in\nthe possibility of reformation even though he repeatedly stated his\napproval of the death penalty and testified that he could impose it\naccording to state legal standards even when the alternative\nsentence of life imprisonment would give a defendant (like everyone\nelse in the world) the opportunity to reform.[ Footnote 5 ] The unlikelihood that his position on\nrehabilitation had anything to do with the peremptory strike of\nFields is underscored by the prosecution’s response after\nMiller-El’s lawyer pointed out that the prosecutor had\nmisrepresented Fields’s responses on the subject. A moment earlier\nthe prosecutor had finished his misdescription of Fields’s views on\npotential rehabilitation with the words, “Those are our reasons for\nexercising our … strike at this time.” Id. , at 197. When\ndefense counsel called him on his misstatement, he neither defended\nwhat he said nor withdrew the strike. Id. , at 198.\nInstead, he suddenly came up with Fields’s brother’s prior\nconviction as another reason for the strike. Id. , at\n199. It would be difficult to credit the State’s\nnew explanation, which reeks of afterthought. While the Court of\nAppeals tried to bolster it with the observation that no seated\njuror was in Fields’s position with respect to his brother, 361\nF. 3d, at 859–860, the court’s readiness to accept the State’s\nsubstitute reason ignores not only its pretextual timing but the\nother reasons rendering it implausible. Fields’s testimony\nindicated he was not close to his brother, App. 190 (“I don’t\nreally know too much about it”), and the prosecution asked nothing\nfurther about the influence his brother’s history might have had on\nFields, as it probably would have done if the family history had\nactually mattered. See, e.g., Ex parte Travis , 776\nSo. 2d 874, 881 (Ala. 2000) (“[T]he State’s failure to engage\nin any meaningful voir dire examination on a subject the State\nalleges it is concerned about is evidence suggesting that the\nexplanation is a sham and a pretext for discrimination”). There is\nno good reason to doubt that the State’s afterthought about\nFields’s brother was anything but makeweight. The Court of Appeals’s judgment on the Fields\nstrike is unsupportable for the same reason the State’s first\nexplanation is itself unsupportable. The Appeals Court’s\ndescription of Fields’s voir dire testimony mentioned only\nhis statements that everyone could be rehabilitated, failing to\nnote that Fields affirmed that he could give the death penalty if\nthe law and evidence called for it, regardless of the possibility\nof divine grace. The Court of Appeals made no mention of the fact\nthat the prosecution mischaracterized Fields as saying he could not\ngive death if rehabilitation were possible. 361 F. 3d, at\n856. In sum, when we look for nonblack jurors\nsimilarly situated to Fields, we find strong similarities as well\nas some differences.[ Footnote\n6 ] But the differences seem far from significant, particularly\nwhen we read Fields’s voir dire testimony in its entirety.\nUpon that reading, Fields should have been an ideal juror in the\neyes of a prosecutor seeking a death sentence, and the prosecutors’\nexplanations for the strike cannot reasonably be accepted. See Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U. S., at 339 (the\ncredibility of reasons given can be m",

    "fulltext": "SYLLABUS OCTOBER TERM, 2004 MILLER-EL V. DRETKE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES MILLER-EL v. DRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS\nDEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS\nDIVISION certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the fifth circuit No. 03–9659.Argued December 6, 2004—Decided June\n13, 2005 When Dallas County prosecutors used peremptory\nstrikes against 10 of the 11 qualified black venire members during\njury selection for petitioner Miller-El’s capital murder trial, he\nobjected, claiming that the strikes were based on race and could\nnot be presumed legitimate since the District Attorney’s Office had\na history of excluding blacks from criminal juries. The trial court\ndenied his request for a new jury, and his trial ended with a death\nsentence. While his appeal was pending, this Court decided, in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 , that\ndiscrimination by a prosecutor in selecting a defendant’s jury\nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment. On remand, the trial court\nreviewed the voir dire record, heard prosecutor Macaluso’s\njustifications for the strikes that were not explained during voir dire , and found no showing that prospective black\njurors were struck because of their race. The State Court of\nCriminal Appeals affirmed. Subsequently, the Federal District Court\ndenied Miller-El federal habeas relief, and the Fifth Circuit\ndenied a certificate of appealability. This Court reversed, finding\nthat the merits of Miller-El’s Batson claim were, at\nleast, debatable by jurists of reason. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322 . The Fifth\nCircuit granted a certificate of appealability but rejected\nMiller-El’s Batson claim on the merits. Held: Miller-El is entitled to\nprevail on his Batson claim and, thus, entitled to habeas\nrelief. Pp. 3–33. (a) “[T]his Court\nconsistently and repeatedly has reaffirmed that racial\ndiscrimination by the State in jury selection offends the Equal\nProtection Clause.” Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42 , 44. The rub\nhas been the practical difficulty of ferreting out discrimination\nin selections discretionary by nature and subject to a myriad of\nlegitimate influences. The Batson Court held that a\ndefendant can make out a prima facie case of discriminatory jury\nselection by “the totality of the relevant facts” about a\nprosecutor’s conduct during the defendant’s own trial. 476 U. S.,\nat 94. Once that showing is made, the burden shifts to the State to\ncome forward with a neutral explanation, id., at 97, and\nthe trial court must determine if the defendant has shown\n“purposeful discrimination,” id., at 98, in light of “all\nrelevant circumstances,” id. , at 96–97. Since this case is\non review of a denial of habeas relief under 28 U. S. C.\n§2254, and since the Texas trial court’s prior determination that\nthe State’s race-neutral explanations were true is a factual\ndetermination, Miller-El may obtain relief only by showing the\ntrial court’s conclusion to be “an unreasonable determination of\nthe facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding,” §2254(e)(1). Pp. 3–6. (b) The prosecutors used peremptory\nstrikes to exclude 91% of the eligible black venire panelists, a\ndisparity unlikely to have been produced by happenstance. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. at 342. More\npowerful than the bare statistics are side-by-side comparisons of\nsome black venire panelists who were struck and white ones who were\nnot. If a prosecutor’s proffered reason for striking a black\npanelist applies just as well to a white panelist allowed to serve,\nthat is evidence tending to prove purposeful discrimination. The\ndetails of two panel member comparisons bear out this Court’s\nobservation, id., at 343, that the prosecution’s reason\nfor exercising peremptory strikes against some black panel members\nappeared to apply equally to some white jurors. There are strong\nsimilarities and some differences between Billy Jean Fields, a\nblack venireman who expressed unwavering support for the death\npenalty but was struck, and similarly situated nonblack jurors; but\nthe differences seem far from significant, particularly when\nreading Fields’s voir dire testimony in its entirety. Upon\nthat reading, Fields should have been an ideal juror in the eyes of\na prosecutor seeking a death sentence, and the prosecutors’\nexplanations for the strike, that Fields would not vote for death\nif rehabilitation were possible, a mischaracterization of his\ntestimony, cannot reasonably be accepted when there were nonblack\nveniremen expressing comparable views on rehabilitation who were\nnot struck. The prosecution’s reason that Fields’s brother had\nprior convictions is not creditable in light of its failure to\nenquire about the matter. The prosecution’s proffered reasons for\nstriking Joe Warren, another black venireman, are comparably\nunlikely. The fact that the reason for striking him, that he\nthought death was an easy way out and defendants should be made to\nsuffer more, also applied to nonblack panel members who were\nselected is evidence of pretext. The suggestion of pretext is not,\nmoreover, mitigated by Macaluso’s explanation that Warren was\nstruck when the State could afford to be liberal in using its 10\nremaining peremptory challenges. Were that the explanation for\nstriking Warren and later accepting similar panel members,\nprosecutors would have struck white panel member Jenkins, who was\nexamined and accepted before Warren despite her similar views.\nMacaluso’s explanation also weakens any suggestion that the State’s\nacceptance of Woods, the one black juror, shows that race was not\nin play. When he was selected as the eighth juror, the State had\nused 11 of its 15 peremptory challenges, 7 on black panel members;\nand the record shows that at least 3 of the remaining venire panel\nopposed capital punishment. Because the prosecutors had to exercise\nprudent restraint, the late-stage decision to accept a black panel\nmember willing to impose the death penalty does not neutralize the\nearly-stage decision to challenge a comparable venireman, Warren.\nThe Fifth Circuit’s substituted reason for the elimination,\nWarren’s general ambivalence about the penalty, was erroneous as a\nmatter of fact and law. As to fact, Macaluso said nothing about\ngeneral ambivalence, and Warren’s answer to several questions was\nthat he could impose the death penalty. As for law, the Batson rule provides the prosecutor an opportunity to give\nthe reason for striking a juror and requires the judge to assess\nthe reason’s plausibility in light of all of the evidence, but it\ndoes not does not call for a mere exercise in thinking up any\nrational basis. Because a prosecutor is responsible for the reason\nhe gave, the Fifth Circuit’s substitution of a reason for excluding\nWarren does nothing to satisfy the prosecutors’ burden of stating a\nracially neutral explanation for their own actions. Comparing\nWarren’s strike with the treatment of panel members with similar\nviews supports a conclusion that race was significant in\ndetermining who was challenged and who was not. Pp. 6–19. (c) The prosecution’s broader patterns of\npractice during jury selection also support the case for\ndiscrimination. Texas law permits either side to shuffle the cards\nbearing panel member names to rearrange the order in which they are\nquestioned. Members seated in the back may escape voir\ndire , for those not questioned by the end of each week are\ndismissed. Here, the prosecution shuffled the cards when a number\nof black members were seated at the front of the panel at the\nbeginning of the second week. The third week, they shuffled when\nthe first four members were black, placing them in the back. After\nthe defense reshuffled the cards, and the black members reappeared\nin the front, the court denied the prosecution’s request for\nanother shuffle. No racially neutral reason for the shuffling has\never been offered, and nothing stops the suspicion of\ndiscriminatory intent from rising to an inference. The contrasting voir dire questions posed respectively to black and\nnonblack panel members also indicate that the State was trying to\navoid black jurors. Prosecutors gave a bland description of the\ndeath penalty to 94% of white venire panel members before asking\nabout the individual’s feelings on the subject, but used a script\ndescribing imposition of the death penalty in graphic terms for 53%\nof the black venire members. The argument that prosecutors used the\ngraphic script to weed out ambivalent panel members simply does not\nfit the facts. Black venire members were more likely to receive\nthat script regardless of their expressions of certainty or\nambivalence about the death penalty, and the State’s chosen\nexplanation failed for four out of the eight black panel members\nwho received it: two received it after clearly stating their\nopposition to the death penalty and two received it even though\nthey unambiguously favored that penalty. The State’s explanation\nmisses the mark four out of five times with regard to the nonblacks\nwho received the graphic description. Ambivalent black panel\nmembers were also more likely to receive the graphic script than\nnonblack ambivalent ones. The State’s attempt at a race-neutral\nrationalization fails to explain what the prosecutors did. The\nexplanation that the prosecutors’ first object was to use the\ngraphic script to make a case for excluding black panel members\nopposed to, or ambivalent about, the death penalty is more\npersuasive than the State’s explanation, and the reasonable\ninference is that race was the major consideration when the\nprosecution chose to follow the graphic script. The same is true\nfor another kind of disparate questioning. The prosecutors asked\nall black panel members opposed to, or ambivalent about, the death\npenalty how low a sentence they would consider imposing for murder\nwithout telling them that the State requires a 5-year minimum, but\nprosecutors did not put that question to most white panel members\nwho had expressed similar views. The final body of evidence\nconfirming the conclusion here is that the Dallas County District\nAttorney’s Office had, for decades, followed a specific policy of\nsystematically excluding blacks from juries. The Miller-El\nprosecutors’ notes of the race of each panel member show that they\ntook direction from a jury selection manual that included racial\nstereotypes. Pp. 19–31. (d) The Fifth Circuit’s conclusion that\nMiller-El failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the\nstate court’s no-discrimination finding was wrong is as\nunsupportable as the “dismissive and strained interpretation” of\nhis evidence that this Court disapproved when deciding that he was\nentitled to a certificate of appealability, Miller-El, supra, at 344. Ten of the eleven black venire members were\nperemptorily struck. At least two of them were ostensibly\nacceptable to prosecutors seeking the death penalty. The\nprosecutors’ chosen race-neutral reasons for the strikes do not\nhold up and are so far at odds with the evidence that pretext is\nthe fair conclusion. The selection process was replete with\nevidence that prosecutors were selecting and rejecting potential\njurors because of race. And the prosecutors took their cues from a\nmanual on jury selection with an emphasis on race. It blinks\nreality to deny that the State struck Fields and Warren because\nthey were black. The facts correlate to nothing as well as to race.\nThe state court’s contrary conclusion was unreasonable as well as\nerroneous. Pp. 32–33. 361 F. 3d 849, reversed and remanded. Souter, J., delivered the opinion\nof the Court, in which Stevens, O’Connor, Kennedy, Ginsburg, and\nBreyer, JJ., joined. Breyer, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nThomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Rehnquist,\nC. J., and Scalia, J., joined. OPINION OF THE COURT MILLER-EL V. DRETKE 545 U. S. ____ (2005) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 03-9659 THOMAS JOE MILLER-EL, PETITIONER v. DOUG\nDRETKE, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE,\nCORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fifth circuit [June 13, 2005] Justice Souter delivered the\nopinion of the Court. Two years ago, we ordered that a\ncertificate of appealability, under 28 U. S. C. §2253(c), be\nissued to habeas petitioner Miller-El, affording review of the\nDistrict Court’s rejection of the claim that prosecutors in his\ncapital murder trial made peremptory strikes of potential jurors\nbased on race. Today we find Miller-El entitled to prevail on that\nclaim and order relief under §2254. I In the course of robbing a\nHoliday Inn in Dallas, Texas in late 1985, Miller-El and his\naccomplices bound and gagged two hotel employees, whom Miller-El\nthen shot, killing one and severely injuring the other. During jury\nselection in Miller-El’s trial for capital murder, prosecutors used\nperemptory strikes against 10 qualified black venire members.\nMiller-El objected that the strikes were based on race and could\nnot be presumed legitimate, given a history of excluding black\nmembers from criminal juries by the Dallas County District\nAttorney’s Office. The trial court received evidence of the\npractice alleged but found no “systematic exclusion of blacks as a\nmatter of policy” by that office, App. 882–883, and therefore no\nentitlement to relief under Swain v. Alabama , 380 U. S. 202 (1965), the case then defining and marking the limits of relief\nfrom racially biased jury selection. The court denied Miller-El’s\nrequest to pick a new jury, and the trial ended with his death\nsentence for capital murder. While an appeal was pending, this\nCourt decided Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986), which replaced Swain ’s threshold requirement to prove systemic\ndiscrimination under a Fourteenth Amendment jury claim, with the\nrule that discrimination by the prosecutor in selecting the\ndefendant’s jury sufficed to establish the constitutional\nviolation. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals then remanded the\nmatter to the trial court to determine whether Miller-El could show\nthat prosecutors in his case peremptorily struck prospective black\njurors because of race. Miller-El v. State , 748\nS. W. 2d 459 (1988). The trial court found no such demonstration.\nAfter reviewing the voir dire record of the explanations\ngiven for some of the challenged strikes, and after hearing one of\nthe prosecutors, Paul Macaluso, give his justification for those\npreviously unexplained, the trial court accepted the stated\nrace-neutral reasons for the strikes, which the judge called\n“completely credible [and] sufficient” as the grounds for a finding\nof “no purposeful discrimination.” Findings of Fact and Conclusions\nof Law Upon Remand from the Court of Criminal Appeals in State v. Miller-El, No. 8668–NL (5th Crim. Dist.\nCt., Dallas County, Tex., Jan. 13, 1989), pp. 5–6, App.\n928–929. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, stating it found\n“ample support” in the voir dire record for the\nrace-neutral explanations offered by prosecutors for the peremptory\nstrikes. Miller-El v. State, No. 69,677 (Sept.\n16, 1992) (per curiam) , p. 2, App. 931. Miller-El then sought habeas relief under 28\nU. S. C. §2254, again pressing his Batson claim,\namong others not now before us. The District Court denied relief, Miller-El v. Johnson , Civil No. 3:96–CV–1992–H\n(ND Tex., June 5, 2000), App. 987, and the Court of Appeals for the\nFifth Circuit precluded appeal by denying a certificate of\nappealability, Miller-El v. Johnson, 261\nF. 3d 445 (2001). We granted certiorari to consider whether\nMiller-El was entitled to review on the Batson claim, Miller-El v. Cockrell, 534 U. S. 1122 (2002),\nand reversed the Court of Appeals. After examining the record of\nMiller-El’s extensive evidence of purposeful discrimination by the\nDallas County District Attorney’s Office before and during his\ntrial, we found an appeal was in order, since the merits of the Batson claim were, at the least, debatable by jurists of\nreason. Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U. S. 322 (2003). After granting a\ncertificate of appealability, the Fifth Circuit rejected\nMiller-El’s Batson claim on the merits. 361 F. 3d 849\n(2004). We again granted certiorari, 542 U. S. 936 (2004),\nand again we reverse. II A “It is well known that prejudices\noften exist against particular classes in the community, which sway\nthe judgment of jurors, and which, therefore, operate in some cases\nto deny to persons of those classes the full enjoyment of that\nprotection which others enjoy.” Strauder v. West\nVirginia , 100\nU. S. 303 , 309 (1880); see also Batson v. Kentucky , supra , at 86. Defendants are harmed, of\ncourse, when racial discrimination in jury selection compromises\nthe right of trial by impartial jury, Strauder v. West\nVirginia , supra , at 308, but racial minorities are\nharmed more generally, for prosecutors drawing racial lines in\npicking juries establish “state-sponsored group stereotypes rooted\nin, and reflective of, historical prejudice,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127 ,\n128 (1994). Nor is the harm confined to\nminorities. When the government’s choice of jurors is tainted with\nracial bias, that “overt wrong … casts doubt over the obligation of\nthe parties, the jury, and indeed the court to adhere to the law\nthroughout the trial … .” Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S. 400 ,\n412 (1991). That is, the very integrity of the courts is\njeopardized when a prosecutor’s discrimination “invites cynicism\nrespecting the jury’s neutrality,” id. , at 412, and\nundermines public confidence in adjudication, Georgia v. McCollum , 505 U. S. 42 , 49 (1992); Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co. , 500 U. S. 614 , 628\n(1991); Batson v. Kentucky , supra, at\n87. So, “[f]or more than a century, this Court consistently and\nrepeatedly has reaffirmed that racial discrimination by the State\nin jury selection offends the Equal Protection Clause.” Georgia v. McCollum , supra , at 44; see Strauder v. West Virginia , supra , at\n308, 310; Norris v. Alabama , 294 U. S. 587 , 596 (1935); Swain v. Alabama , supra, at 223–224; Batson v. Kentucky , supra , at 84; Powers v. Ohio , supra , at 404. The rub has been the practical difficulty of\nferreting out discrimination in selections discretionary by nature,\nand choices subject to myriad legitimate influences, whatever the\nrace of the individuals on the panel from which jurors are\nselected. In Swain v. Alabama , we tackled the\nproblem of “the quantum of proof necessary” to show purposeful\ndiscrimination, 380 U. S., at 205, with an eye to preserving each\nside’s historical prerogative to make a peremptory strike or\nchallenge, the very nature of which is traditionally “without a\nreason stated,” id. , at 220. The Swain Court\ntried to relate peremptory challenge to equal protection by\npresuming the legitimacy of prosecutors’ strikes except in the face\nof a longstanding pattern of discrimination: when “in case after\ncase, whatever the circumstances,” no blacks served on juries, then\n“giving even the widest leeway to the operation of irrational but\ntrial-related suspicions and antagonisms, it would appear that the\npurposes of the peremptory challenge [were] being perverted.” Id. , at 223–224. Swain ’s demand to make out a\ncontinuity of discrimination over time, however, turned out to be\ndifficult to the point of unworkable, and in Batson v. Kentucky , we recognized that this requirement to show an\nextended pattern imposed a “crippling burden of proof” that left\nprosecutors’ use of peremptories “largely immune from\nconstitutional scrutiny.” 476 U. S., at 92–93. By Batson ’s\nday, the law implementing equal protection elsewhere had evolved\ninto less discouraging standards for assessing a claim of\npurposeful discrimination, id. , at 93–95 (citing, e.g. , Washington v. Davis , 426 U. S. 229 (1976),\nand Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing\nDevelopment Corp. , 429 U. S. 252 (1977)),\nand we accordingly held that a defendant could make out a prima\nfacie case of discriminatory jury selection by “the totality of the\nrelevant facts” about a prosecutor’s conduct during the defendant’s\nown trial. Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S., at 94,\n96. “Once the defendant makes a prima facie showing, the burden\nshifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation for\nchallenging … jurors” within an arguably targeted class. Id. , at 97. Although there may be “any number of bases on\nwhich a prosecutor reasonably [might] believe that it is desirable\nto strike a juror who is not excusable for cause … , the\nprosecutor must give a clear and reasonably specific explanation of\nhis legitimate reasons for exercising the challeng[e].” Id. , at 98, n. 20 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n“The trial court then will have the duty to determine if the\ndefendant has established purposeful discrimination.” Id. ,\nat 98. Although the move from Swain to Batson left a defendant free to challenge the prosecution\nwithout having to cast Swain ’s wide net, the net was not\nentirely consigned to history, for Batson ’s individualized\nfocus came with a weakness of its own owing to its very emphasis on\nthe particular reasons a prosecutor might give. If any facially\nneutral reason sufficed to answer a Batson challenge, then Batson would not amount to much more than Swain .\nSome stated reasons are false, and although some false reasons are\nshown up within the four corners of a given case, sometimes a court\nmay not be sure unless it looks beyond the case at hand. Hence Batson ’s explanation that a defendant may rely on “all\nrelevant circumstances” to raise an inference of purposeful\ndiscrimination. 476 U. S., at 96–97. B This case comes to us on review\nof a denial of habeas relief sought under 28 U. S. C. §2254,\nfollowing the Texas trial court’s prior determination of fact that\nthe State’s race-neutral explanations were true, see Purkett v. Elem , 514 U. S. 765 , 769\n(1995) (per curiam); Batson v. Kentucky , supra , at 98, n. 21. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996, Miller-El may obtain relief only by showing\nthe Texas conclusion to be “an unreasonable determination of the\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the State court\nproceeding.” 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(2). Thus we presume the\nTexas court’s factual findings to be sound unless Miller-El rebuts\nthe “presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.”\n§2254(e)(1). The standard is demanding but not insatiable; as we\nsaid the last time this case was here, “[d]eference does not by\ndefinition preclude relief.” Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U. S., at 340. III A The numbers describing the\nprosecution’s use of peremptories are remarkable. Out of 20 black\nmembers of the 108-person venire panel for Miller-El’s trial, only\n1 served. Although 9 were excused for cause or by agreement, 10\nwere peremptorily struck by the prosecution. Id. , at 331.\n“The prosecutors used their peremptory strikes to exclude 91% of\nthe eligible African-American venire members … . Happenstance\nis unlikely to produce this disparity.” Id. , at 342. More powerful than these bare\nstatistics, however, are side-by-side comparisons of some black\nvenire panelists who were struck and white panelists allowed to\nserve. If a prosecutor’s proffered reason for striking a black\npanelist applies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack who\nis permitted to serve, that is evidence tending to prove purposeful\ndiscrimination to be considered at Batson ’s third step.\nCf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc. , 530 U. S. 133 ,\n147 (2000) (in employment discrimination cases, “[p]roof that the\ndefendant’s explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form\nof circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional\ndiscrimination, and it may be quite persuasive”). While we did not\ndevelop a comparative juror analysis last time, we did note that\nthe prosecution’s reasons for exercising peremptory strikes against\nsome black panel members appeared equally on point as to some white\njurors who served. Miller-El v. Cockrell , supra , at 343.[ Footnote\n1 ] The details of two panel member comparisons bear this\nout.[ Footnote 2 ] The prosecution used its second peremptory\nstrike to exclude Billy Jean Fields, a black man who expressed\nunwavering support for the death penalty. On the questionnaire\nfilled out by all panel members before individual examination on\nthe stand, Fields said that he believed in capital punishment,\nJoint Lodging 14, and during questioning he disclosed his belief\nthat the State acts on God’s behalf when it imposes the death\npenalty. “Therefore, if the State exacts death, then that’s what it\nshould be.” App. 174. He testified that he had no religious or\nphilosophical reservations about the death penalty and that the\ndeath penalty deterred crime. Id. , at 174–175. He twice\naverred, without apparent hesitation, that he could sit on\nMiller-El’s jury and make a decision to impose this penalty. Id. , at 176–177. Although at one point in the questioning,\nFields indicated that the possibility of rehabilitation might be\nrelevant to the likelihood that a defendant would commit future\nacts of violence, id. , at 183, he responded to ensuing\nquestions by saying that although he believed anyone could be\nrehabilitated, this belief would not stand in the way of a decision\nto impose the death penalty: “[B]ased on what you [the prosecutor] said as far\nas the crime goes, there are only two things that could be\nrendered, death or life in prison. If for some reason the testimony\ndidn’t warrant death, then life imprisonment would give an\nindividual an opportunity to rehabilitate. But, you know, you said\nthat the jurors didn’t have the opportunity to make a personal\ndecision in the matter with reference to what I thought or felt,\nbut it was just based on the questions according to the way the law\nhas been handed down.” Id. , at 185 (alteration\nomitted). Fields also noted on his\nquestionnaire that his brother had a criminal history. Joint\nLodging 13. During questioning, the prosecution went into this,\ntoo: “Q   Could you tell me a little bit\nabout that? “A   He was arrested and convicted on [a] number\nof occasions for possession of a controlled substance. “Q   Was that here in Dallas? “A   Yes. “Q   Was he involved in any trials or anything\nlike that? “A   I suppose of sorts. I don’t really know too\nmuch about it. “Q   Was he ever convicted? “A   Yeah, he served time. “Q   Do you feel that that would in any way\ninterfere with your service on this jury at all? “A   No.” App. 190. Fields was struck peremptorily by\nthe prosecution, with prosecutor James Nelson offering a\nrace-neutral reason: “[W]e … have concern with reference to some of his\nstatements as to the death penalty in that he said that he could\nonly give death if he thought a person could not be rehabilitated\nand he later made the comment that any person could be\nrehabilitated if they find God or are introduced to God and the\nfact that we have a concern that his religious feelings may affect\nhis jury service in this case.” Id. , at 197 (alteration\nomitted). Thus, Nelson simply\nmischaracterized Fields’s testimony. He represented that Fields\nsaid he would not vote for death if rehabilitation was possible,\nwhereas Fields unequivocally stated that he could impose the death\npenalty regardless of the possibility of rehabilitation. Perhaps\nNelson misunderstood, but unless he had an ulterior reason for\nkeeping Fields off the jury we think he would have proceeded\ndifferently. In light of Fields’s outspoken support for the death\npenalty, we expect the prosecutor would have cleared up any\nmisunderstanding by asking further questions before getting to the\npoint of exercising a strike. If, indeed, Fields’s thoughts on\nrehabilitation did make the prosecutor uneasy, he should have\nworried about a number of white panel members he accepted with no\nevident reservations. Sandra Hearn said that she believed in the\ndeath penalty “if a criminal cannot be rehabilitated and continues\nto commit the same type of crime.” Id. , at 429.[ Footnote 3 ] Hearn went so far as to\nexpress doubt that at the penalty phase of a capital case she could\nconclude that a convicted murderer “would probably commit some\ncriminal acts of violence in the future.” Id. , at 440.\n“People change,” she said, making it hard to assess the risk of\nsomeone’s future dangerousness. “[T]he evidence would have to be\nawful strong.” Ibid . But the prosecution did not respond\nto Hearn the way it did to Fields, and without delving into her\nviews about rehabilitation with any further question, it raised no\nobjection to her serving on the jury. White panelist Mary Witt said\nshe would take the possibility of rehabilitation into account in\ndeciding at the penalty phase of the trial about a defendant’s\nprobability of future dangerousness, 6 Record of Voir Dire 2433 (hereinafter Record), but the prosecutors asked her no further\nquestion about her views on reformation, and they accepted her as a\njuror. Id. , at 2464–2465.[ Footnote 4 ] Latino venireman Fernando Gutierrez, who\nserved on the jury, said that he would consider the death penalty\nfor someone who could not be rehabilitated, App. 777, but the\nprosecutors did not question him further about this view. In sum,\nnonblack jurors whose remarks on rehabilitation could well have\nsignaled a limit on their willingness to impose a death sentence\nwere not questioned further and drew no objection, but the\nprosecution expressed apprehension about a black juror’s belief in\nthe possibility of reformation even though he repeatedly stated his\napproval of the death penalty and testified that he could impose it\naccording to state legal standards even when the alternative\nsentence of life imprisonment would give a defendant (like everyone\nelse in the world) the opportunity to reform.[ Footnote 5 ] The unlikelihood that his position on\nrehabilitation had anything to do with the peremptory strike of\nFields is underscored by the prosecution’s response after\nMiller-El’s lawyer pointed out that the prosecutor had\nmisrepresented Fields’s responses on the subject. A moment earlier\nthe prosecutor had finished his misdescription of Fields’s views on\npotential rehabilitation with the words, “Those are our reasons for\nexercising our … strike at this time.” Id. , at 197. When\ndefense counsel called him on his misstatement, he neither defended\nwhat he said nor withdrew the strike. Id. , at 198.\nInstead, he suddenly came up with Fields’s brother’s prior\nconviction as another reason for the strike. Id. , at\n199. It would be difficult to credit the State’s\nnew explanation, which reeks of afterthought. While the Court of\nAppeals tried to bolster it with the observation that no seated\njuror was in Fields’s position with respect to his brother, 361\nF. 3d, at 859–860, the court’s readiness to accept the State’s\nsubstitute reason ignores not only its pretextual timing but the\nother reasons rendering it implausible. Fields’s testimony\nindicated he was not close to his brother, App. 190 (“I don’t\nreally know too much about it”), and the prosecution asked nothing\nfurther about the influence his brother’s history might have had on\nFields, as it probably would have done if the family history had\nactually mattered. See, e.g., Ex parte Travis , 776\nSo. 2d 874, 881 (Ala. 2000) (“[T]he State’s failure to engage\nin any meaningful voir dire examination on a subject the State\nalleges it is concerned about is evidence suggesting that the\nexplanation is a sham and a pretext for discrimination”). There is\nno good reason to doubt that the State’s afterthought about\nFields’s brother was anything but makeweight. The Court of Appeals’s judgment on the Fields\nstrike is unsupportable for the same reason the State’s first\nexplanation is itself unsupportable. The Appeals Court’s\ndescription of Fields’s voir dire testimony mentioned only\nhis statements that everyone could be rehabilitated, failing to\nnote that Fields affirmed that he could give the death penalty if\nthe law and evidence called for it, regardless of the possibility\nof divine grace. The Court of Appeals made no mention of the fact\nthat the prosecution mischaracterized Fields as saying he could not\ngive death if rehabilitation were possible. 361 F. 3d, at\n856. In sum, when we look for nonblack jurors\nsimilarly situated to Fields, we find strong similarities as well\nas some differences.[ Footnote\n6 ] But the differences seem far from significant, particularly\nwhen we read Fields’s voir dire testimony in its entirety.\nUpon that reading, Fields should have been an ideal juror in the\neyes of a prosecutor seeking a death sentence, and the prosecutors’\nexplanations for the strike cannot reasonably be accepted. See Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U. S., at 339 (the\ncredibility of reasons given can be m",

CALIFORNIA certiorari to the court of appeal of california,\nfirst appellate district No. 04–6964.Argued April 18, 2005—Decided June 13,\n2005 Petitioner Johnson, a black man, was convicted in a\nCalifornia state court of assaulting and murdering a white child.\nDuring jury selection, a number of prospective jurors were removed\nfor cause until 43 eligible jurors remained, three of whom were\nblack. The prosecutor used 3 of his 12 peremptory challenges to\nremove the prospective black jurors, resulting in an all-white\njury. Defense counsel objected to those strikes on the ground that\nthey were unconstitutionally based on race. The trial judge did not\nask the prosecutor to explain his strikes, but instead simply found\nthat petitioner had failed to establish a prima facie case of\npurposeful discrimination under the governing state precedent, People v. Wheeler , which required a showing of a\nstrong likelihood that the exercise of peremptory challenges was\nbased on group bias. The judge explained that, although the case\nwas close, his review of the record convinced him that the\nprosecutor’s strikes could be justified by race-neutral reasons.\nThe California Court of Appeal set aside the conviction, but the\nState Supreme Court reinstated it, stressing that Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 , permits\nstate courts to establish the standards used to evaluate the\nsufficiency of prima facie cases of purposeful discrimination in\njury selection. Reviewing Batson , Wheeler , and\ntheir progeny, the court concluded that Wheeler ’s “strong\nlikelihood” standard is entirely consistent with Batson .\nUnder Batson , the court held, a state court may require\nthe objector to present not merely enough evidence to permit an\ninference that discrimination has occurred, but sufficiently strong\nevidence to establish that the challenges, if not explained, were\nmore likely than not based on race. Applying that standard, the\ncourt acknowledged that the exclusion of all three black\nprospective jurors looked suspicious, but deferred to the trial\njudge’s ruling. Held: California’s “more likely than not”\nstandard is an inappropriate yardstick by which to measure the\nsufficiency of a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in\njury selection. This narrow but important issue concerns the scope\nof the first of three steps Batson enumerated: (1) Once\nthe defendant has made out a prima facie case and (2) the State has\nsatisfied its burden to offer permissible race-neutral\njustifications for the strikes, e.g., 476 U. S., at 94,\nthen (3) the trial court must decide whether the defendant has\nproved purposeful racial discrimination, Purkett v. Elem , 514\nU. S. 765 . Batson does not permit California to\nrequire at step one that the objector show that it is more likely\nthan not the other party’s peremptory challenges, if unexplained,\nwere based on impermissible group bias. The Batson Court\nheld that a prima facie case can be made out by offering a wide\nvariety of evidence, so long as the sum of the proffered facts\ngives “rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.” 476 U. S.,\nat 94. The Court explained that to establish a prima facie case,\nthe defendant must show that his membership in a cognizable racial\ngroup, the prosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges to remove\nmembers of that group, the indisputable fact that such challenges\npermit those inclined to discriminate to do so, and any other\nrelevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor\nexcluded venire members on account of race . Id., at 96.\nThe Court assumed that the trial judge would have the benefit of\nall relevant circumstances, including the prosecutor’s explanation,\nbefore deciding whether it was more likely than not that the\nperemptory challenge was improperly motivated. The Court did not\nintend the first step to be so onerous that a defendant would have\nto persuade the judge—on the basis of all the facts, some of which\nare impossible for the defendant to know with certainty—that the\nchallenge was more likely than not the product of purposeful\ndiscrimination. Instead, a defendant satisfies Batson ’s\nfirst step requirements by producing evidence sufficient to permit\nthe trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has\noccurred. The facts of this case illustrate that California’s\nstandard is at odds with the prima facie inquiry mandated by Batson . The permissible inferences of discrimination,\nwhich caused the trial judge to comment that the case was close and\nthe California Supreme Court to acknowledge that it was suspicious\nthat all three black prospective jurors were removed, were\nsufficient to establish a prima facie case. Pp. 10–11. Reversed and remanded. Stevens, J., delivered the\nopinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and O’Connor,\nScalia, Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.\nBreyer, J., filed a concurring opinion. Thomas, J., filed a\ndissenting opinion. OPINION OF THE COURT JOHNSON V. CALIFORNIA 545 U. S. ____ (2005) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 04-6964 JAY SHAWN JOHNSON, PETITIONER v. CALIFORNIA on writ of certiorari to the court of appeal of\ncalifornia, first appellate district [June 13, 2005] Justice Stevens delivered the\nopinion of the Court. The Supreme Court of California\nand the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit have\nprovided conflicting answers to the following question: “Whether to\nestablish a prima facie case under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), the objector must\nshow that it is more likely than not that the other party’s\nperemptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermissible\ngroup bias?” Pet. for Cert. i. Because both of those courts\nregularly review the validity of convictions obtained in California\ncriminal trials, respondent, the State of California, agreed to\npetitioner’s request that we grant certiorari and resolve the\nconflict. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that the question\npresented must be answered in the negative, and accordingly reverse\nthe judgment of the California Supreme Court. I Petitioner Jay Shawn Johnson, a\nblack male, was convicted in a California trial court of\nsecond-degree murder and assault on a white 19-month-old child,\nresulting in death. During jury selection, a number of prospective\njurors were removed for cause until 43 eligible jurors remained, 3\nof whom were black. The prosecutor used 3 of his 12 peremptory\nchallenges to remove the black prospective jurors. The resulting\njury, including alternates, was all white. After the prosecutor exercised\nthe second of his three peremptory challenges against the\nprospective black jurors, defense counsel objected on the ground\nthat the challenge was unconstitutionally based on race under both\nthe California and United States Constitutions. People v. Johnson , 30 Cal. 4th 1302, 1307, 71 P. 3d 270,\n272–273 (2003).[ Footnote 1 ]\nDefense counsel alleged that the prosecutor “had no apparent reason\nto challenge this prospective juror ‘other than [her] racial\nidentity.’ ” Ibid. (alteration in original). The\ntrial judge did not ask the prosecutor to explain the rationale for\nhis strikes. Instead, the judge simply found that petitioner had\nfailed to establish a prima facie case under the governing state\nprecedent, People v. Wheeler , 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583\nP. 2d 748 (1978), reasoning “ ‘that there’s not been\nshown a strong likelihood that the exercise of the\nperemptory challenges were based upon a group rather than an\nindividual basis,’ ” 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 71 P. 3d, at\n272 (emphasis added). The judge did, however, warn the prosecutor\nthat “ ‘we are very close.’ ” People v. Johnson , 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d 727, 729 (2001). Defense counsel made an additional motion the\nnext day when the prosecutor struck the final remaining prospective\nblack juror. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307, 71 P. 3d, at 272. Counsel\nargued that the prosecutor’s decision to challenge all of the\nprospective black jurors constituted a “systematic attempt to\nexclude African-Americans from the jury panel.” 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d,\nat 729. The trial judge still did not seek an explanation from the\nprosecutor. Instead, he explained that his own examination of the\nrecord had convinced him that the prosecutor’s strikes could be\njustified by race-neutral reasons. Specifically, the judge opined\nthat the black venire members had offered equivocal or confused\nanswers in their written questionnaires. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1307–1308,\n71 P. 3d, at 272–273. Despite the fact that “ ‘the Court\nwould not grant the challenges for cause, there were answers … at\nleast on the questionnaires themselves [such] that the Court felt\nthat there was sufficient basis’ ” for the strikes. Id. , at 1308, 71 P. 3d, at 273 (brackets added).\nTherefore, even considering that all of the prospective black\njurors had been stricken from the pool, the judge determined that\npetitioner had failed to establish a prima facie case. The California Court of Appeal set aside the\nconviction. People v. Johnson , 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d\n727 (2001). Over the dissent of one judge, the majority ruled that\nthe trial judge had erred by requiring petitioner to establish a\n“strong likelihood” that the peremptory strikes had been\nimpermissibly based on race. Instead, the trial judge should have\nonly required petitioner to proffer enough evidence to support an\n“inference” of discrimination.[ Footnote 2 ] The Court of Appeal’s holding relied on\ndecisions of this Court, prior California case law, and the\ndecision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit in Wade v. Terhune , 202 F. 3d 1190\n(2000). Applying the proper “reasonable inference” standard, the\nmajority concluded that petitioner had produced sufficient evidence\nto support a prima facie case. Respondent appealed, and the California\nSupreme Court reinstated petitioner’s conviction over the dissent\nof two justices. The court stressed that Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986), left to state\ncourts the task of establishing the standards used to evaluate the\nsufficiency of defendants’ prima facie cases. 30 Cal. 4th, at 1314,\n71 P. 3d, at 277. The court then reviewed Batson , Wheeler , and those decisions’ progeny, and concluded that\n“ Wheeler’ s terms ‘strong likelihood’ and ‘reasonable\ninference’ state the same standard”—one that is entirely consistent\nwith Batson . 30 Cal. 4th, at 1313, 71 P. 3d, at 277.\nA prima facie case under Batson establishes a\n“ ‘legally mandatory, rebuttable presumption,’ ” it does\nnot merely constitute “enough evidence to permit the\ninference ” that discrimination has occurred. 30 Cal. 4th, at\n1315, 71 P. 3d, at 278. Batson , the court held,\n“permits a court to require the objector to present, not merely\n‘some evidence’ permitting the inference, but ‘strong evidence’\nthat makes discriminatory intent more likely than not if\nthe challenges are not explained.” 30 Cal. 4th, at 1316, 71\nP. 3d, at 278. The court opined that while this burden is “not\nonerous,” it remains “substantial.” Ibid. , 71 P. 3d,\nat 279. Applying that standard, the court acknowledged\nthat the case involved the “highly relevant” circumstance that a\nblack defendant was “charged with killing ‘his White girlfriend’s\nchild,’ ” and that “it certainly looks suspicious that all\nthree African-American prospective jurors were removed from the\njury.” Id., at 1326, 71 P. 3d, at 286. Yet\npetitioner’s Batson showing, the court held, consisted\n“primarily of the statistical disparity of peremptory challenges\nbetween African-Americans and others.” 30 Cal. 4th, at 1327, 71\nP. 3d, at 287. Although those statistics were indeed\n“troubling and, as the trial court stated, the question was close,” id. , at 1328, 71 P. 3d, at 287, the court decided to\ndefer to the trial judge’s “carefully considered ruling.” Ibid .[ Footnote 3 ] We\ngranted certiorari, but dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction\nbecause the judgment was not yet final. Johnson v. California, 541 U. S. 428 (2004) (per curiam). After the California Court of Appeal decided\nthe remaining issues, we again granted certiorari. 543 U. S. ___\n(2005). II The issue in this case is narrow\nbut important. It concerns the scope of the first of three steps\nthis Court enumerated in Batson , which together guide\ntrial courts’ constitutional review of peremptory strikes. Those\nthree Batson steps should by now be familiar. First, the\ndefendant must make out a prima facie case “by showing that the\ntotality of the relevant facts gives rise to an inference of\ndiscriminatory purpose.” 476 U. S., at 93–94 (citing Washington v. Davis , 426 U. S. 229 , 239–242\n(1976)).[ Footnote 4 ] Second,\nonce the defendant has made out a prima facie case, the “burden\nshifts to the State to explain adequately the racial exclusion” by\noffering permissible race-neutral justifications for the strikes.\n476 U. S., at 94; see also Alexander v. Louisiana , 405 U. S. 625 , 632\n(1972). Third, “[i]f a race-neutral explanation is tendered, the\ntrial court must then decide … whether the opponent of the strike\nhas proved purposeful racial discrimination.” Purkett v. Elem , 514\nU. S. 765 , 767 (1995) (per curiam). The question before us is\nwhether Batson permits California to require at step one that\n“the objector must show that it is more likely than not the other\nparty’s peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on\nimpermissible group bias.” 30 Cal. 4th, at 1318, 71 P. 3d, at\n280. Although we recognize that States do have flexibility in\nformulating appropriate procedures to comply with Batson ,\nwe conclude that California’s “more likely than not” standard is an\ninappropriate yardstick by which to measure the sufficiency of a\nprima facie case. We begin with Batson itself, which on\nits own terms provides no support for California’s rule. There, we\nheld that a prima facie case of discrimination can be made out by\noffering a wide variety of evidence,[ Footnote 5 ] so long as the sum of the proffered facts\ngives “rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.” 476 U. S.,\nat 94. We explained that “a defendant may establish a prima facie case of\npurposeful discrimination in selection of the petit jury solely on\nevidence concerning the prosecutor’s exercise of peremptory\nchallenges at the defendant’s trial. To establish such a case, the\ndefendant first must show that he is a member of a cognizable\nracial group, and that the prosecutor has exercised peremptory\nchallenges to remove from the venire members of the defendant’s\nrace. Second, the defendant is entitled to rely on the fact, as to\nwhich there can be no dispute, that peremptory challenges\nconstitute a jury selection practice that permits ‘those to\ndiscriminate who are of a mind to discriminate.’ Finally, the\ndefendant must show that these facts and any other relevant\ncircumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used that\npractice to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury on account of\ntheir race.” Id., at 96 (citations omitted) (quoting Avery v. Georgia , 345 U. S. 559 , 562\n(1953)). Indeed, Batson held that\nbecause the petitioner had timely objected to the prosecutor’s\ndecision to strike “all black persons on the venire,” the trial\ncourt was in error when it “flatly rejected the objection without\nrequiring the prosecutor to give an explanation for his action.”\n476 U. S., at 100. We did not hold that the petitioner had proved\ndiscrimination . Rather, we remanded the case for further\nproceedings because the trial court failed to demand an explanation\nfrom the prosecutor— i.e. , to proceed to Batson ’s\nsecond step—despite the fact that the petitioner’s evidence\nsupported an inference of discrimination. Ibid. Thus, in describing the burden-shifting\nframework, we assumed in Batson that the trial judge would\nhave the benefit of all relevant circumstances, including the\nprosecutor’s explanation, before deciding whether it was more\nlikely than not that the challenge was improperly motivated. We did\nnot intend the first step to be so onerous that a defendant would\nhave to persuade the judge—on the basis of all the facts, some of\nwhich are impossible for the defendant to know with certainty—that\nthe challenge was more likely than not the product of purposeful\ndiscrimination. Instead, a defendant satisfies the requirements of Batson ’s first step by producing evidence sufficient to\npermit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has\noccurred. Respondent, however, focuses on Batson ’s ultimate sentence: “If the trial court decides\nthat the facts establish, prima facie, purposeful discrimination\nand the prosecutor does not come forward with a neutral explanation\nfor his action, our precedents require that petitioner’s conviction\nbe reversed.” Ibid. For this to be true, respondent\ncontends, a Batson claim must prove the ultimate facts by\na preponderance of the evidence in the prima facie case; otherwise,\nthe argument goes, a prosecutor’s failure to respond to a prima\nfacie case would inexplicably entitle a defendant to judgment as a\nmatter of law on the basis of nothing more than an inference that\ndiscrimination may have occurred. Brief for Respondent 13–18. Respondent’s argument is misguided. Batson , of course, explicitly stated that the defendant\nultimately carries the “burden of persuasion” to “ ‘prove the\nexistence of purposeful discrimination.’ ” 476 U. S., at 93\n(quoting Whitus v. Georgia , 385 U. S. 545 , 550\n(1967)). This burden of persuasion “rests with, and never shifts\nfrom, the opponent of the strike.” Purkett , 514 U. S., at\n768. Thus, even if the State produces only a frivolous or utterly\nnonsensical justification for its strike, the case does not end—it\nmerely proceeds to step three. Ibid.[ Footnote 6 ] The first two Batson steps\ngovern the production of evidence that allows the trial court to\ndetermine the persuasiveness of the defendant’s constitutional\nclaim. “It is not until the third step that the\npersuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant—the step in\nwhich the trial court determines whether the opponent of the strike\nhas carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.” Purkett, supra, at 768.[ Footnote 7 ] Batson ’s purposes further support our\nconclusion. The constitutional interests Batson sought to\nvindicate are not limited to the rights possessed by the defendant\non trial, see 476 U. S., at 87, nor to those citizens who desire to\nparticipate “in the administration of the law, as jurors,” Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 , 308\n(1880). Undoubtedly, the overriding interest in eradicating\ndiscrimination from our civic institutions suffers whenever an\nindividual is excluded from making a significant contribution to\ngovernance on account of his race. Yet the “harm from\ndiscriminatory jury selection extends beyond that inflicted on the\ndefendant and the excluded juror to touch the entire community.\nSelection procedures that purposefully exclude black persons from\njuries undermine public confidence in the fairness of our system of\njustice.” Batson , 476 U. S., at 87; see also Smith v. Texas , 311 U. S. 128 , 130\n(1940) (“For racial discrimination to result in the exclusion from\njury service of otherwise qualified groups not only violates our\nConstitution and the laws enacted under it but it is at war with\nour basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative\ngovernment” (footnote omitted)). The Batson framework is designed to\nproduce actual answers to suspicions and inferences that\ndiscrimination may have infected the jury selection process. See\n476 U. S., at 97–98, and n. 20. The inherent uncertainty\npresent in inquiries of discriminatory purpose counsels against\nengaging in needless and imperfect speculation when a direct answer\ncan be obtained by asking a simple question. See Paulino v. Castro , 371 F. 3d 1083, 1090 (CA9 2004) (“[I]t\ndoes not matter that the prosecutor might have had good reasons …\n[w]hat matters is the real reason they were stricken” (emphasis\ndeleted)); Holloway v. Horn , 355 F. 3d 707,\n725 (CA3 2004) (speculation “does not aid our inquiry into the\nreasons the prosecutor actually harbored” for a peremptory strike).\nThe three-step process thus simultaneously serves the public\npurposes Batson is designed to vindicate and encourages\n“prompt rulings on objections to peremptory challenges without\nsubstantial disruption of the jury selection process.” Hernandez v. New York , 500 U. S. 352 , 358–359\n(1991) (opinion of Kennedy, J.). The disagreements among the state-court judges\nwho reviewed the record in this case illustrate the imprecision of\nrelying on judicial speculation to resolve plausible claims of\ndiscrimination. In this case the inference of discrimination was\nsufficient to invoke a comment by the trial judge “that ‘we are\nvery close,’ ” and on review, the California Supreme\nacknowledged that “it certainly looks suspicious that all three\nAfrican-American prospective jurors were removed from the jury.” 30\nCal. 4th, at 1307, 1326, 71 P. 3d, at 273, 286. Those\ninferences that discrimination may have occurred were sufficient to\nestablish a prima facie case under Batson . The facts of this case well illustrate that\nCalifornia’s “more likely than not” standard is at odds with the\nprima facie inquiry mandated by Batson . The judgment of\nthe California Supreme Court is therefore reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this\nopinion. It is so ordered Footnote 1 Petitioner’s state objection was made under People v. Wheeler , 22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d\n748 (1978). Footnote 2 In reaching this holding, the Court of Appeal\nrejected the notion that a showing of a “ ‘strong\nlikelihood’ ” is equivalent to a “ ‘reasonable\ninference.’ ” To conclude so would “be as novel a proposition\nas the idea that ‘clear and convincing evidence’ has always meant a\n‘preponderance of the evidence.’ ” 105 Cal. Rptr. 2d, at\n733. Footnote 3 In dissent, Justice Kennard argued that\n“[r]equiring a defendant to persuade the trial court of the\nprosecutor’s discriminatory purpose at the first Wheeler-Batson stage short-circuits the process, and\nprovides inadequate protection for the defendant’s right to a fair\ntrial … .” 30 Cal. 4th, at 1333, 71 P. 3d, at 291.\nThe proper standard for measuring a prima facie case under Batson is whether the defendant has identified actions by\nthe prosecutor that, “ if unexplained, permit a reasonable\ninference of an improper purpose or motive.” 30 Cal. 4th, at 1339,\n71 P. 3d, at 294. Trial judges, Justice Kennard argued, should\nnot speculate when it is not “apparent that the [neutral]\nexplanation was the true reason for the challenge.” Id. ,\nat 1340, 71 P. 3d, at 295. Footnote 4 An “inference” is generally understood to be\na “conclusion reached by considering other facts and deducing a\nlogical consequence from them.” Black’s Law Dictionary 781 (7th ed.\n1999). Footnote 5 In Batson , we spoke of the methods\nby which prima facie cases could be proved in permissive terms. A\ndefendant may satisfy his prima facie burden, we said, “by relying\nsolely on the facts concerning [the selection of the venire] in\nhis case .” 476 U. S., at 95 (emphasis in original). We\ndeclined to require proof of a pattern or practice because\n“ ‘[a] single invidiously discriminatory governmental act’ is\nnot ‘immunized by the absence of such discrimination in the making\nof other comparable decisions.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development\nCorp. , 429 U.\nS. 252 , 266, n. 14 (1977)). Footnote 6 In the unlikely hypothetical in which the\nprosecutor declines to respond to a trial judge’s inquiry regarding\nhis justification for making a strike, the evidence before the\njudge would consist not only of the original facts from which the\nprima facie case was established, but also the prosecutor’s refusal\nto justify his strike in light of the court’s request. Such a\nrefusal would provide additional support for the inference of\ndiscrimination raised by a defendant’s prima facie case. Cf. United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration , 273 U. S. 103 , 111\n(1927). Footnote 7 This explanation comports with our\ninterpretation of the burden-shifting framework in cases arising\nunder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See, e.g., Furnco Constr. Corp . v. Waters, 438 U. S. 567 ,\n577 (1978) (noting that the McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green , 411\nU. S. 792 (1973), framework “is merely a sensible, orderly way\nto evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears\non the critical question of discrimination”); see also St.\nMary’s Honor Center v. Hicks , 509 U. S. 502 , 509–510,\nand n. 3 (1993) (holding that determinations at steps one and\ntwo of the McDonnell Douglas framework “can involve no\ncredibility assessment” because “the burden-of-production\ndetermination necessarily precedes the\ncredibility-assessment stage,” and that the burden-shifting\nframework triggered by a defendant’s prima face case is essentially\njust “a means of ‘arranging the presentation of evidence’ ”\n(quoting Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust , 487 U. S. 977 ,\n986 (1988)).",

MISSOURI certiorari to the supreme court of missouri No. 04–5293.Argued March 1, 2005—Decided May 23,\n2005 Petitioner Deck was convicted of capital murder and\nsentenced to death, but the Missouri Supreme Court set aside the\nsentence. At his new sentencing proceeding, he was shackled with\nleg irons, handcuffs, and a belly chain. The trial court overruled\ncounsel’s objections to the shackles, and Deck was again sentenced\nto death. Affirming, the State Supreme Court rejected Deck’s claim\nthat his shackling violated, inter alia, the Federal\nConstitution. Held: The Constitution forbids the\nuse of visible shackles during a capital trial’s penalty phase, as\nit does during the guilt phase, unless that use is “justified by an\nessential state interest”—such as courtroom security—specific to\nthe defendant on trial. Holbrook v. Flynn, 475 U. S. 560 ,\n568–569. Pp. 3–10. (a) The law has long\nforbidden routine use of visible shackles during a capital trial’s\nguilt phase, permitting shackling only in the presence of a special\nneed. In light of Holbrook , Illinois v. Allen, 397\nU. S. 337 , early English cases, and lower court shackling\ndoctrine dating back to the 19th century, it is now clear that this\nis a basic element of due process protected by the Federal\nConstitution. Thus, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit\nusing physical restraints visible to the jury absent a trial court\ndetermination, in the exercise of its discretion, that restraints\nare justified by a state interest specific to the particular\ndefendant on trial. Pp. 3–6. (b) If the reasons motivating the guilt\nphase constitutional rule—the presumption of innocence, securing a\nmeaningful defense, and maintaining dignified proceedings—apply\nwith like force at the penalty phase, the same rule will apply\nthere. The latter two considerations obviously apply. As for the\nfirst, while the defendant’s conviction means that the presumption\nof innocence no longer applies, shackles at the penalty phase\nthreaten related concerns. The jury, though no longer deciding\nbetween guilt and innocence, is deciding between life and death,\nwhich, given the sanction’s severity and finality, is no less\nimportant, Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721 , 732. Nor\nis accuracy in making that decision any less critical. Yet, the\noffender’s appearance in shackles almost inevitably implies to a\njury that court authorities consider him a danger to the community\n(which is often a statutory aggravator and always a relevant\nfactor); almost inevitably affects adversely the jury’s perception\nof the defendant’s character; and thereby inevitably undermines the\njury’s ability to weigh accurately all relevant considerations when\ndetermining whether the defendant deserves death. The\nconstitutional rule that courts cannot routinely place defendants\nin shackles or other restraints visible to the jury during the\npenalty phase is not absolute. In the judge’s discretion, account\nmay be taken of special circumstances in the case at hand,\nincluding security concerns, that may call for shackling in order\nto accommodate the important need to protect the courtroom and its\noccupants. Pp. 6–10. (c) Missouri’s arguments that its high\ncourt’s decision in this case meets the Constitution’s requirements\nare unconvincing. The first—that that court properly concluded that\nthere was no evidence that the jury saw the restraints—is\ninconsistent with the record, which shows that the jury was aware\nof them, and overstates what the court actually said, which was\nthat trial counsel made no record of the extent of the\njury’s awareness of the shackles. The second—that the trial court\nacted within its discretion—founders on the record, which does not\nclearly indicate that the judge weighted the particular\ncircumstances of the case. The judge did not refer to an escape\nrisk or threat to courtroom security or explain why, if shackles\nwere necessary, he did not provide nonvisible ones as was\napparently done during the guilt phase of this case. The third—that\nDeck suffered no prejudice—fails to take account of Holbrook ’s statement that shackling is “inherently\nprejudicial,” 475 U. S., at 568, a view rooted in this Court’s\nbelief that the practice will often have negative effects that\n“cannot be shown from a trial transcript,” Riggins v. Nevada, 504\nU. S. 127 , 137. Thus, where a court, without adequate\njustification, orders the defendant to wear shackles visible to the\njury, the defendant need not demonstrate actual prejudice to make\nout a due process violation. The State must prove “beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the [shackling] did not contribute to the\nverdict obtained.” Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 , 24.\nPp. 10–12. 136 S. W. 3d 481, reversed and remanded. Breyer, J., delivered the opinion\nof the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens,\nO’Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined. Thomas, J.,\nfiled a dissenting opinion, in which Scalia, J., joined. OPINION OF THE COURT DECK V. MISSOURI 544 U. S. ____ (2005) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 04-5293 CARMAN L. DECK, PETITIONER v. MISSOURI on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmissouri [May 23, 2005] Justice Breyer delivered the\nopinion of the Court. We here consider whether\nshackling a convicted offender during the penalty phase of a\ncapital case violates the Federal Constitution. We hold that the\nConstitution forbids the use of visible shackles during the penalty\nphase, as it forbids their use during the guilt phase, unless that use is “justified by an essential state\ninterest”—such as the interest in courtroom security—specific to\nthe defendant on trial. Holbrook v. Flynn , 475 U. S. 560 ,\n568–569 (1986); see also Illinois v. Allen , 397 U. S. 337 ,\n343–344 (1970). I In July 1996, petitioner Carman\nDeck robbed, shot, and killed an elderly couple. In 1998, the State\nof Missouri tried Deck for the murders and the robbery. At trial,\nstate authorities required Deck to wear leg braces that apparently\nwere not visible to the jury. App. 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 21, 25, 29.\nDeck was convicted and sentenced to death. The State Supreme Court\nupheld Deck’s conviction but set aside the sentence. 68 S. W.\n3d 418, 432 (2002). The State then held a new sentencing\nproceeding. From the first day of the new\nproceeding, Deck was shackled with leg irons, handcuffs, and a\nbelly chain. App. 58. Before the jury voir dire began,\nDeck’s counsel objected to the shackles. The objection was\noverruled. Ibid . ; see also id., at\n41–55. During the voir dire , Deck’s counsel renewed the\nobjection. The objection was again overruled, the court stating\nthat Deck “has been convicted and will remain in legirons and a\nbelly chain.” Id., at 58. After the voir dire, Deck’s counsel once again objected, moving to strike the jury panel\n“because of the fact that Mr. Deck is shackled in front of the jury\nand makes them think that he is … violent today.” Id ., at\n58–59. The objection was again overruled, the court stating that\nhis “being shackled takes any fear out of their minds.” Id ., at 59. The penalty phase then proceeded with Deck in\nshackles. Deck was again sentenced to death. 136 S. W. 3d 481,\n485 (Mo. 2004) (en banc). On appeal, Deck claimed that his shackling\nviolated both Missouri law and the Federal Constitution. The\nMissouri Supreme Court rejected these claims, writing that there\nwas “no record of the extent of the jury’s awareness of the\nrestraints”; there was no “claim that the restraints impeded” Deck\n“from participating in the proceedings”; and there was “evidence”\nof “a risk” that Deck “might flee in that he was a repeat offender”\nwho may have “killed his two victims to avoid being returned to\ncustody.” Ibid . Thus, there was “sufficient evidence in\nthe record to support the trial court’s exercise of its discretion”\nto require shackles, and in any event Deck “has not demonstrated\nthat the outcome of his trial was prejudiced… . Neither being\nviewed in shackles by the venire panel prior to trial, nor being\nviewed while restrained throughout the entire trial, alone, is\nproof of prejudice.” Ibid . The court rejected Deck’s other\nclaims of error and affirmed the sentence. We granted certiorari to review Deck’s claim\nthat his shackling violated the Federal Constitution. II We first consider whether, as a\ngeneral matter, the Constitution permits a State to use visible\nshackles routinely in the guilt phase of a criminal trial. The\nanswer is clear: The law has long forbidden routine use of visible\nshackles during the guilt phase; it permits a State to shackle a\ncriminal defendant only in the presence of a special need. This rule has deep roots in the\ncommon law. In the 18th century, Blackstone wrote that “it is laid\ndown in our antient books, that, though under an indictment of the\nhighest nature,” a defendant “must be brought to the bar without\nirons, or any manner of shackles or bonds; unless there be evident\ndanger of an escape.” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of\nEngland 317 (1769) (footnote omitted); see also 3 E. Coke,\nInstitutes of the Laws of England *34 (“If felons come in judgement\nto answer, … they shall be out of irons, and all manner of bonds,\nso that their pain shall not take away any manner of reason, nor\nthem constrain to answer, but at their free will”). Blackstone and\nother English authorities recognized that the rule did not apply at\n“the time of arraignment,” or like proceedings before the judge.\nBlackstone, supra , at 317; see also Trial of\nChristopher Layer , 16 How. St. Tr. 94, 99 (K. B. 1722).\nIt was meant to protect defendants appearing at trial before a\njury. See King v. Waite , 1 Leach 28, 36, 168 Eng.\nRep. 117, 120 (K. B. 1743) (“[B]eing put upon his trial, the\nCourt immediately ordered [the defendant’s] fetters to be knocked\noff”). American courts have traditionally followed\nBlackstone’s “ancient” English rule, while making clear that “in\nextreme and exceptional cases, where the safe custody of the\nprisoner and the peace of the tribunal imperatively demand, the\nmanacles may be retained.” 1 J. Bishop, New Criminal Procedure\n§955, p. 573 (4th ed. 1895); see also id ., at 572–573\n(“[O]ne at the trial should have the unrestrained use of his\nreason, and all advantages, to clear his innocence… .

While these earlier courts disagreed\nabout the degree of discretion to be afforded trial judges, see post , at 9–14 (Thomas, J., dissenting), they settled\nvirtually without exception on a basic rule embodying notions of\nfundamental fairness: trial courts may not shackle defendants\nroutinely, but only if there is a particular reason to do so. More recently, this Court has suggested that a\nversion of this rule forms part of the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments’ due process guarantee. Thirty-five years ago, when\nconsidering the trial of an unusually obstreperous criminal\ndefendant, the Court held that the Constitution sometimes permitted\nspecial measures, including physical restraints. Allen ,\n397 U. S., at 343–344. The Court wrote that “binding and gagging\nmight possibly be the fairest and most reasonable way to handle”\nsuch a defendant. Id ., at 344. But the Court immediately\nadded that “even to contemplate such a technique … arouses a\nfeeling that no person should be tried while shackled and gagged\nexcept as a last resort.” Ibid . Sixteen years later, the Court considered a\nspecial courtroom security arrangement that involved having\nuniformed security personnel sit in the first row of the\ncourtroom’s spectator section. The Court held that the Constitution\nallowed the arrangement, stating that the deployment of security\npersonnel during trial is not “the sort of inherently prejudicial\npractice that, like shackling, should be permitted only where\njustified by an essential state interest specific to each trial.” Holbrook, 475 U. S., at 568–569. See also Estelle v. Williams , 425 U. S. 501 , 503, 505\n(1976) (making a defendant appear in prison garb poses such a\nthreat to the “fairness of the factfinding process” that it must be\njustified by an “essential state policy”). Lower courts have treated these statements as\nsetting forth a constitutional standard that embodies Blackstone’s\nrule. Courts and commentators share close to a consensus that,\nduring the guilt phase of a trial, a criminal defendant has a right\nto remain free of physical restraints that are visible to the jury;\nthat the right has a constitutional dimension; but that the right\nmay be overcome in a particular instance by essential state\ninterests such as physical security, escape prevention, or\ncourtroom decorum. See, e.g. , Dyas v. Poole , 309 F. 3d 586, 588–589 (CA9 2002) (per\ncuriam); Harrell v. Israel , 672 F. 2d 632, 635\n(CA7 1982) (per curiam); State v.

Krauskopf,\nPhysical Restraint of the Defendant in the Courtroom, 15 St. Louis\nU. L. J. 351 (1970–1971); ABA Standards for Criminal\nJustice: Discovery and Trial by Jury 15–3.2, pp. 188–191 (3d\ned. 1996). Lower courts have disagreed about the specific\nprocedural steps a trial court must take prior to shackling, about\nthe amount and type of evidence needed to justify restraints, and\nabout what forms of prejudice might warrant a new trial, but they\nhave not questioned the basic principle. They have emphasized the\nimportance of preserving trial court discretion (reversing only in\ncases of clear abuse), but they have applied the limits on that\ndiscretion described in Holbrook , Allen , and the\nearly English cases. In light of this precedent, and of a lower\ncourt consensus disapproving routine shackling dating back to the\n19th century, it is clear that this Court’s prior statements gave\nvoice to a principle deeply embedded in the law. We now conclude\nthat those statements identify a basic element of the “due process\nof law” protected by the Federal Constitution. Thus, the Fifth and\nFourteenth Amendments prohibit the use of physical restraints\nvisible to the jury absent a trial court determination, in the\nexercise of its discretion, that they are justified by a state\ninterest specific to a particular trial. Such a determination may\nof course take into account the factors that courts have\ntraditionally relied on in gauging potential security problems and\nthe risk of escape at trial. III We here consider shackling not\nduring the guilt phase of an ordinary criminal trial, but during\nthe punishment phase of a capital case. And we must decide whether\nthat change of circumstance makes a constitutional difference. To\ndo so, we examine the reasons that motivate the guilt-phase\nconstitutional rule and determine whether they apply with similar\nforce in this context. A Judicial hostility to shackling\nmay once primarily have reflected concern for the suffering—the\n“tortures” and “torments”—that “very painful” chains could cause.\nKrauskopf, supra , at 351, 353 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also Riggins v. Nevada , 504 U. S. 127 , 154,\nn. 4 (1992) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing English cases\ncurbing the use of restraints). More recently, this Court’s\nopinions have not stressed the need to prevent physical suffering\n(for not all modern physical restraints are painful). Instead they\nhave emphasized the importance of giving effect to three\nfundamental legal principles. First, the criminal process\npresumes that the defendant is innocent until proved guilty. Coffin v. United States , 156 U. S. 432 , 453\n(1895) (presumption of innocence “lies at the foundation of the\nadministration of our criminal law”). Visible shackling undermines\nthe presumption of innocence and the related fairness of the\nfactfinding process. Cf. Estelle , supra, at 503.\nIt suggests to the jury that the justice system itself sees a “need\nto separate a defendant from the community at large.” Holbrook , supra, at 569; cf. State v. Roberts , 86 N. J. Super., at 162, 206 A. 2d, at\n202 (“[A] defendant ‘ought not be brought to the Bar in a\ncontumelious Manner; as with his Hands tied together, or any other\nMark of Ignominy and Reproach … unless there be some Danger of a\nRescous [rescue] or Escape’ ” (quoting 2 W. Hawkins, Pleas of\nthe Crown, ch. 28, §1, p. 308 (1716–1721) (section on\narraignments))). Second, the Constitution, in order to help the\naccused secure a meaningful defense, provides him with a right to\ncounsel. See, e.g. , Amdt. 6; Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U. S. 335 , 340–341\n(1963). The use of physical restraints diminishes that right.\nShackles can interfere with the accused’s “ability to communicate”\nwith his lawyer. Allen , 397 U. S., at 344. Indeed, they\ncan interfere with a defendant’s ability to participate in his own\ndefense, say by freely choosing whether to take the witness stand\non his own behalf. Cf. Cranburne’s Case , 13 How. St. Tr.\n222 (K. B. 1696) (“Look you, keeper, you should take off the\nprisoners irons when they are at the bar, for they should stand at\ntheir ease when they are tried” (footnote omitted)); People v. Harrington , 42 Cal., at 168 (shackles\n“impos[e] physical burdens, pains, and restraints … , … ten[d]\nto confuse and embarrass” defendants’ “mental faculties,” and\nthereby tend “materially to abridge and prejudicially affect his\nconstitutional rights”). Third, judges must seek to maintain a judicial\nprocess that is a dignified process. The courtroom’s formal\ndignity, which includes the respectful treatment of defendants,\nreflects the importance of the matter at issue, guilt or innocence,\nand the gravity with which Americans consider any deprivation of an\nindividual’s liberty through criminal punishment. And it reflects a\nseriousness of purpose that helps to explain the judicial system’s\npower to inspire the confidence and to affect the behavior of a\ngeneral public whose demands for justice our courts seek to serve.\nThe routine use of shackles in the presence of juries would\nundermine these symbolic yet concrete objectives. As this Court has\nsaid, the use of shackles at trial “affront[s]” the “dignity and\ndecorum of judicial proceedings that the judge is seeking to\nuphold.” Allen , supra, at 344; see also Trial\nof Christopher Layer , 16 How. St. Tr., at 99 (statement of Mr.\nHungerford) (“[T]o have a man plead for his life” in shackles\nbefore “a court of justice, the highest in the kingdom for criminal\nmatters, where the king himself is supposed to be personally\npresent” undermines the “dignity of the Court”). There will be cases, of course, where these\nperils of shackling are unavoidable. See Allen , supra, at 344. We do not underestimate the need to\nrestrain dangerous defendants to prevent courtroom attacks, or the\nneed to give trial courts latitude in making individualized\nsecurity determinations. We are mindful of the tragedy that can\nresult if judges are not able to protect themselves and their\ncourtrooms. But given their prejudicial effect, due process does\nnot permit the use of visible restraints if the trial court has not\ntaken account of the circumstances of the particular case. B The considerations that militate\nagainst the routine use of visible shackles during the guilt phase\nof a criminal trial apply with like force to penalty proceedings in\ncapital cases. This is obviously so in respect to the latter two\nconsiderations mentioned, securing a meaningful defense and\nmaintaining dignified proceedings. It is less obviously so in\nrespect to the first consideration mentioned, for the defendant’s\nconviction means that the presumption of innocence no longer\napplies. Hence shackles do not undermine the jury’s effort to apply\nthat presumption. Nonetheless, shackles at the\npenalty phase threaten related concerns. Although the jury is no\nlonger deciding between guilt and innocence, it is deciding between\nlife and death. That decision, given the “ ‘severity’ ”\nand “ ‘finality’ ” of the sanction, is no less important\nthan the decision about guilt. Monge v. California , 524 U. S. 721 , 732\n(1998) (quoting Gardner v. Florida , 430 U. S. 349 , 357\n(1977)). Neither is accuracy in making that decision\nany less critical. The Court has stressed the “acute need” for\nreliable decisionmaking when the death penalty is at issue. Monge, supra, at 732 (citing Lockett v. Ohio , 438\nU. S. 586 , 604 (1978) (plurality opinion)). The appearance of\nthe offender during the penalty phase in shackles, however, almost\ninevitably implies to a jury, as a matter of common sense, that\ncourt authorities consider the offender a danger to the\ncommunity—often a statutory aggravator and nearly always a relevant\nfactor in jury decisionmaking, even where the State does not\nspecifically argue the point. Cf. Brief for Respondent 25–27. It\nalso almost inevitably affects adversely the jury’s perception of\nthe character of the defendant. See Zant v. Stephens , 462 U. S. 862 , 900\n(1983) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment) (character and\npropensities of the defendant are part of a “unique, individualized\njudgment regarding the punishment that a particular person\ndeserves”). And it thereby inevitably undermines the jury’s ability\nto weigh accurately all relevant considerations—considerations that\nare often unquantifiable and elusive—when it determines whether a\ndefendant deserves death. In these ways, the use of shackles can be\na “thumb [on] death’s side of the scale.” Sochor v. Florida , 504 U. S. 527 , 532\n(1992) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Riggins, 504 U. S., at 142 (Kennedy, J., concurring)\n(through control of a defendant’s appearance, the State can exert a\n“powerful influence on the outcome of the trial”). Given the presence of similarly weighty\nconsiderations, we must conclude that courts cannot routinely place\ndefendants in shackles or other physical restraints visible to the\njury during the penalty phase of a capital proceeding. The\nconstitutional requirement, however, is not absolute. It permits a\njudge, in the exercise of his or her discretion, to take account of\nspecial circumstances, including security concerns, that may call\nfor shackling. In so doing, it accommodates the important need to\nprotect the courtroom and its occupants. But any such determination\nmust be case specific; that is to say, it should reflect particular\nconcerns, say special security needs or escape risks, related to\nthe defendant on trial. IV Missouri claims that the decision\nof its high court meets the Constitution’s requirements in this\ncase. It argues that the Missouri Supreme Court properly found: (1)\nthat the record lacks evidence that the jury saw the restraints;\n(2) that the trial court acted within its discretion; and, in any\nevent, (3) that the defendant suffered no prejudice. We find these\narguments unconvincing. The first argument is\ninconsistent with the record in this case, which makes clear that\nthe jury was aware of the shackles. See App. 58–59 (Deck’s attorney\nstated on the record that “Mr. Deck [was] shackled in front of\nthe jury ”) (emphasis added); id., at 59 (trial court\nresponded that “him being shackled takes any fear out of their\nminds”). The argument also overstates the Missouri Supreme Court’s\nholding. The court said, “[T]rial counsel made no record of the\nextent of the jury’s awareness of the restraints throughout\nthe penalty phase, and Appellant does not claim that the restraints\nimpeded him from participating in the proceedings.” 136 S. W.\n3d, at 485 (emphasis added). This statement does not suggest that\nthe jury was unaware of the restraints. Rather, it refers to the\ndegree of the jury’s awareness, and hence to the kinds of prejudice\nthat might have occurred. The second argument—that the trial court acted\nwithin its discretion—founders on the record’s failure to indicate\nthat the trial judge saw the matter as one calling for discretion.\nThe record contains no formal or informal findings. Cf. supra , at 9 (requiring a case-by-case determination). The\njudge did not refer to a risk of escape—a risk the State has raised\nin this Court, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 36–37—or a threat to courtroom\nsecurity. Rather, he gave as his reason for imposing the shackles\nthe fact that Deck already “has been convicted.” App. 58. While he\nalso said that the shackles would “take any fear out of” the\njuror’s “minds,” he nowhere explained any special reason for fear. Id ., at 59. Nor did he explain why, if shackles were\nnecessary, he chose not to provide for shackles that the jury could\nnot see—apparently the arrangement used at trial. If there is an\nexceptional case where the record itself makes clear that there are\nindisputably good reasons for shackling, it is not this one. The third argument fails to take account of\nthis Court’s statement in Holbrook that shackling is\n“inherently prejudicial.” 475 U. S., at 568. That statement is\nrooted in our belief that the practice will often have negative\neffects, but—like “the consequences of compelling a defendant to\nwear prison clothing” or of forcing him to stand trial while\nmedicated—those effects “cannot be shown from a trial transcript.” Riggins , supra, at 137. Thus, where a court,\nwithout adequate justification, orders the defendant to wear\nshackles that will be seen by the jury, the defendant need not\ndemonstrate actual prejudice to make out a due process violation.\nThe State must prove “beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n[shackling] error complained of did not contribute to the verdict\nobtained.” Chapman v. California , 386 U. S. 18 , 24\n(1967). V For these reasons, the judgment\nof the Missouri Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded\nfor further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.",

    "fulltext": "SYLLABUS OCTOBER TERM, 2004 MUEHLER V. MENA SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES MUEHLER et al. v. MENA certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the ninth circuit No. 03–1423.Argued December 8, 2004—Decided March\n22, 2005 Respondent Mena and others were detained in\nhandcuffs during a search of the premises they occupied.\nPetitioners were lead members of a police detachment executing a\nsearch warrant of these premises for, inter alia , deadly\nweapons and evidence of gang membership. Mena sued the officers\nunder 42 U. S. C. §1983, and the District Court found in her\nfavor. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the use of\nhandcuffs to detain Mena during the search violated the Fourth\nAmendment and that the officers’ questioning of Mena about her\nimmigration status during the detention constituted an independent\nFourth Amendment violation. Held: 1. Mena’s detention in\nhandcuffs for the length of the search did not violate the Fourth\nAmendment. That detention is consistent with Michigan v. Summers , 452 U. S. 692 , 705, in\nwhich the Court held that officers executing a search warrant for\ncontraband have the authority “to detain the occupants of the\npremises while a proper search is conducted.” The Court there noted\nthat minimizing the risk of harm to officers is a substantial\njustification for detaining an occupant during a search, id. , at 702–703, and ruled that an officer’s authority to\ndetain incident to a search is categorical and does not depend on\nthe “quantum of proof justifying detention or the extent of the\nintrusion to be imposed by the seizure,” id. , at 705, n.\n19. Because a warrant existed to search the premises and Mena was\nan occupant of the premises at the time of the search, her\ndetention for the duration of the search was reasonable under Summers . Inherent in Summers ’ authorization to\ndetain is the authority to use reasonable force to effectuate the\ndetention. See Graham v. Connor , 490 U. S. 386 , 396. The\nuse of force in the form of handcuffs to detain Mena was reasonable\nbecause the governmental interest in minimizing the risk of harm to\nboth officers and occupants, at its maximum when a warrant\nauthorizes a search for weapons and a wanted gang member resides on\nthe premises, outweighs the marginal intrusion. See id .,\nat 396–397. Moreover, the need to detain multiple occupants made\nthe use of handcuffs all the more reasonable. Cf. Maryland v. Wilson , 519 U. S. 408 , 414.\nAlthough the duration of a detention can affect the balance of\ninterests, the 2- to 3-hour detention in handcuffs in this case\ndoes not outweigh the government’s continuing safety interests. Pp.\n4–7. 2. The officers’ questioning of Mena\nabout her immigration status during her detention did not violate\nher Fourth Amendment rights. The Ninth Circuit’s holding to the\ncontrary appears premised on the assumption that the officers were\nrequired to have independent reasonable suspicion in order to so\nquestion Mena. However, this Court has “held repeatedly that mere\npolice questioning does not constitute a seizure.” Florida v. Bostick , 501 U. S. 429 , 434.\nBecause Mena’s initial detention was lawful and the Ninth Circuit\ndid not hold that the detention was prolonged by the questioning,\nthere was no additional seizure within the meaning of the Fourth\nAmendment, and, therefore, no additional Fourth Amendment\njustification for inquiring about Mena’s immigration status was\nrequired. Cf. Illinois v. Caballes , 543 U. S. ___\n, ___ (slip op., at 2–4). Pp. 7–8. 3. Because the Ninth Circuit did not\naddress Mena’s alternative argument that her detention extended\nbeyond the time the police completed the tasks incident to the\nsearch, this Court declines to address it. See, e.g., Pierce\nCounty v. Guillen, 537 U. S. 129 , 148,\nn. 10. Pp. 8–9. 332 F. 3d 1255, vacated and remanded. Rehnquist, C. J., delivered\nthe opinion of the Court, in which O’Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and\nThomas, JJ., joined. Kennedy, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nStevens, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment, in which\nSouter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. OPINION OF THE COURT MUEHLER V. MENA 544 U. S. ____ (2005) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 03-1423 DARIN L. MUEHLER, et al., PETITIONERS v. IRIS MENA on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit [March 22, 2005] Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered\nthe opinion of the Court. Respondent Iris Mena was detained\nin handcuffs during a search of the premises that she and several\nothers occupied. Petitioners were lead members of a police\ndetachment executing a search warrant of these premises. She sued\nthe officers under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, and\nthe District Court found in her favor. The Court of Appeals\naffirmed the judgment, holding that the use of handcuffs to detain\nMena during the search violated the Fourth Amendment and that the\nofficers’ questioning of Mena about her immigration status during\nthe detention constituted an independent Fourth Amendment\nviolation. Mena v. Simi Valley, 332 F. 3d\n1255 (CA9 2003). We hold that Mena’s detention in handcuffs for the\nlength of the search was consistent with our opinion in Michigan v . Summers , 452\nU. S. 692 (1981), and that the officers’ questioning during\nthat detention did not violate her Fourth Amendment rights. *** Based on information gleaned from\nthe investigation of a gang-related, driveby shooting, petitioners\nMuehler and Brill had reason to believe at least one member of a\ngang—the West Side Locos—lived at 1363 Patricia Avenue. They also\nsuspected that the individual was armed and dangerous, since he had\nrecently been involved in the driveby shooting. As a result,\nMuehler obtained a search warrant for 1363 Patricia Avenue that\nauthorized a broad search of the house and premises for, among\nother things, deadly weapons and evidence of gang membership. In\nlight of the high degree of risk involved in searching a house\nsuspected of housing at least one, and perhaps multiple, armed gang\nmembers, a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team was used to\nsecure the residence and grounds before the search. At 7 a.m. on February 3, 1998,\npetitioners, along with the SWAT team and other officers, executed\nthe warrant. Mena was asleep in her bed when the SWAT team, clad in\nhelmets and black vests adorned with badges and the word “POLICE,”\nentered her bedroom and placed her in handcuffs at gunpoint. The\nSWAT team also handcuffed three other individuals found on the\nproperty. The SWAT team then took those individuals and Mena into a\nconverted garage, which contained several beds and some other\nbedroom furniture. While the search proceeded, one or two officers\nguarded the four detainees, who were allowed to move around the\ngarage but remained in handcuffs. Aware that the West Side Locos gang was\ncomposed primarily of illegal immigrants, the officers had notified\nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that they would be\nconducting the search, and an INS officer accompanied the officers\nexecuting the warrant. During their detention in the garage, an\nofficer asked for each detainee’s name, date of birth, place of\nbirth, and immigration status. The INS officer later asked the\ndetainees for their immigration documentation. Mena’s status as a\npermanent resident was confirmed by her papers. The search of the premises yielded a .22\ncaliber handgun with .22 caliber ammunition, a box of .25 caliber\nammunition, several baseball bats with gang writing, various\nadditional gang paraphernalia, and a bag of marijuana. Before the\nofficers left the area, Mena was released. In her §1983 suit against the officers she\nalleged that she was detained “for an unreasonable time and in an\nunreasonable manner” in violation of the Fourth Amendment. App. 19.\nIn addition, she claimed that the warrant and its execution were\noverbroad, that the officers failed to comply with the “knock and\nannounce” rule, and that the officers had needlessly destroyed\nproperty during the search. The officers moved for summary\njudgment, asserting that they were entitled to qualified immunity,\nbut the District Court denied their motion. The Court of Appeals\naffirmed that denial, except for Mena’s claim that the\nwarrant was overbroad; on this claim the Court of Appeals held that\nthe officers were entitled to qualified immunity. Mena v. Simi Valley, 226 F. 3d 1031 (CA9 2000). After a\ntrial, a jury, pursuant to a special verdict form, found that\nOfficers Muehler and Brill violated Mena’s Fourth Amendment right\nto be free from unreasonable seizures by detaining her both with\nforce greater than that which was reasonable and for a longer\nperiod than that which was reasonable. The jury awarded Mena\n$10,000 in actual damages and $20,000 in punitive damages against\neach petitioner for a total of $60,000. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment on\ntwo grounds. 332 F. 3d 1255 (CA9 2003). Reviewing the denial\nof qualified immunity de novo , id. , at 1261,\nn. 2, it first held that the officers’ detention of Mena\nviolated the Fourth Amendment because it was objectively\nunreasonable to confine her in the converted garage and keep her in\nhandcuffs during the search, id., at 1263–1264. In the\nCourt of Appeals’ view, the officers should have released Mena as\nsoon as it became clear that she posed no immediate threat. Id., at 1263. The court additionally held that the\nquestioning of Mena about her immigration status constituted an\nindependent Fourth Amendment violation. Id., at 1264–1266.\nThe Court of Appeals went on to hold that those rights were clearly\nestablished at the time of Mena’s questioning, and thus the\nofficers were not entitled to qualified immunity. Id., at\n1266–1267. We granted certiorari, 542 U. S. ___ (2004), and now\nvacate and remand. *** In Michigan v. Summers, 452\nU. S. 692 (1981), we held that officers executing a search\nwarrant for contraband have the authority “to detain the occupants\nof the premises while a proper search is conducted.” Id., at 705. Such detentions are appropriate, we explained, because the\ncharacter of the additional intrusion caused by detention is slight\nand because the justifications for detention are substantial. Id., at 701–705. We made clear that the detention of an\noccupant is “surely less intrusive than the search itself,” and the\npresence of a warrant assures that a neutral magistrate has\ndetermined that probable cause exists to search the home. Id., at 701. Against this incremental intrusion, we\nposited three legitimate law enforcement interests that provide\nsubstantial justification for detaining an occupant: “preventing\nflight in the event that incriminating evidence is found”;\n“minimizing the risk of harm to the officers”; and facilitating\n“the orderly completion of the search,” as detainees’\n“self-interest may induce them to open locked doors or locked\ncontainers to avoid the use of force.” Id., at\n702–703. Mena’s detention was, under Summers , plainly permissible.[ Footnote 1 ] An officer’s authority to detain incident to a\nsearch is categorical; it does not depend on the “quantum of proof\njustifying detention or the extent of the intrusion to be imposed\nby the seizure.” Id., at 705, n. 19. Thus, Mena’s\ndetention for the duration of the search was reasonable under Summers because a warrant existed to search 1363 Patricia\nAvenue and she was an occupant of that address at the time of the\nsearch. Inherent in Summers ’ authorization to\ndetain an occupant of the place to be searched is the authority to\nuse reasonable force to effectuate the detention. See Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386 , 396\n(1989) (“Fourth Amendment jurisprudence has long recognized that\nthe right to make an arrest or investigatory stop necessarily\ncarries with it the right to use some degree of physical coercion\nor threat thereof to effect it”). Indeed, Summers itself\nstressed that the risk of harm to officers and occupants is\nminimized “if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command\nof the situation.” 452 U. S. , at 703. The officers’ use of force in the form of\nhandcuffs to effectuate Mena’s detention in the garage, as well as\nthe detention of the three other occupants, was reasonable because\nthe governmental interests outweigh the marginal intrusion. See Graham , supra , at 396–397. The imposition of\ncorrectly applied handcuffs on Mena, who was already being lawfully\ndetained during a search of the house, was undoubtedly a separate\nintrusion in addition to detention in the converted\ngarage.[ Footnote 2 ] The\ndetention was thus more intrusive than that which we upheld in Summers . See 452 U. S., at 701–702 (concluding that the\nadditional intrusion in the form of a detention was less than that\nof the warrant-sanctioned search); Maryland v. Wilson, 519\nU. S. 408 , 413–414 (1997) (concluding that the additional\nintrusion from ordering passengers out of a car, which was already\nstopped, was minimal). But this was no ordinary search. The\ngovernmental interests in not only detaining, but using handcuffs,\nare at their maximum when, as here, a warrant authorizes a search\nfor weapons and a wanted gang member resides on the premises. In\nsuch inherently dangerous situations, the use of handcuffs\nminimizes the risk of harm to both officers and occupants. Cf. Summers , supra, at 702–703 (recognizing the\nexecution of a warrant to search for drugs “may give rise to sudden\nviolence or frantic efforts to conceal or destroy evidence”).\nThough this safety risk inherent in executing a search warrant for\nweapons was sufficient to justify the use of handcuffs, the need to\ndetain multiple occupants made the use of handcuffs all the more\nreasonable. Cf. Maryland v. Wilson, supra , at 414 (noting that “danger to an officer from a\ntraffic stop is likely to be greater when there are passengers in\naddition to the driver in the stopped car”). Mena argues that, even if the use of handcuffs\nto detain her in the garage was reasonable as an initial matter,\nthe duration of the use of handcuffs made the detention\nunreasonable. The duration of a detention can, of course, affect\nthe balance of interests under Graham . However, the 2- to\n3- hour detention in handcuffs in this case does not outweigh the\ngovernment’s continuing safety interests. As we have noted, this\ncase involved the detention of four detainees by two officers\nduring a search of a gang house for dangerous weapons. We conclude\nthat the detention of Mena in handcuffs during the search was\nreasonable. The Court of Appeals also determined that the\nofficers violated Mena’s Fourth Amendment rights by questioning her\nabout her immigration status during the detention. 332 F. 3d,\nat 1264–1266. This holding, it appears, was premised on the\nassumption that the officers were required to have independent\nreasonable suspicion in order to question Mena concerning her\nimmigration status because the questioning constituted a discrete\nFourth Amendment event. But the premise is faulty. We have “held\nrepeatedly that mere police questioning does not constitute a\nseizure.” Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429 , 434\n(1991); see also INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S. 210 , 212\n(1984). “[E]ven when officers have no basis for suspecting a\nparticular individual, they may generally ask questions of that\nindividual; ask to examine the individual’s identification; and\nrequest consent to search his or her luggage.” Bostick , supra , at 434–435 (citations omitted). As the Court of\nAppeals did not hold that the detention was prolonged by the\nquestioning, there was no additional seizure within the meaning of\nthe Fourth Amendment. Hence, the officers did not need reasonable\nsuspicion to ask Mena for her name, date and place of birth, or\nimmigration status. Our recent opinion in Illinois v. Caballes , 543 U. S. ___ (2005), is instructive. There, we\nheld that a dog sniff performed during a traffic stop does not\nviolate the Fourth Amendment. We noted that a lawful seizure “can\nbecome unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably\nrequired to complete that mission,” but accepted the state court’s\ndetermination that the duration of the stop was not extended by the\ndog sniff. Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 2–3). Because we held\nthat a dog sniff was not a search subject to the Fourth Amendment,\nwe rejected the notion that “the shift in purpose” “from a lawful\ntraffic stop into a drug investigation” was unlawful because it\n“was not supported by any reasonable suspicion.” Id. , at\n___ (slip op., at 3–4). Likewise here, the initial Summers detention was lawful; the Court of Appeals did not find that the\nquestioning extended the time Mena was detained. Thus no additional\nFourth Amendment justification for inquiring about Mena’s\nimmigration status was required.[ Footnote 3 ] In summary, the officers’ detention of Mena in\nhandcuffs during the execution of the search warrant was reasonable\nand did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Additionally, the\nofficers’ questioning of Mena did not constitute an independent\nFourth Amendment violation. Mena has advanced in this Court, as she\ndid before the Court of Appeals, an alternative argument for\naffirming the judgment below. She asserts that her detention\nextended beyond the time the police completed the tasks incident to\nthe search. Because the Court of Appeals did not address this\ncontention, we too decline to address it. See Pierce\nCounty v. Guillen, 537 U. S. 129 , 148,\nn. 10 (2003); National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Smith, 525\nU. S. 459 , 469–470 (1999). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\ntherefore vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Footnote 1 In determining whether a Fourth Amendment\nviolation occurred we draw all reasonable factual inferences in\nfavor of the jury verdict, but as we made clear in Ornelas v. United States , 517 U. S. 690 , 697–699\n(1996), we do not defer to the jury’s legal conclusion that those\nfacts violate the Constitution. Footnote 2 In finding the officers should have released\nMena from the handcuffs, the Court of Appeals improperly relied\nupon the fact that the warrant did not include Mena as a suspect.\nSee Mena v. Simi Valley, 332 F. 3d 1255,\n1263, n. 5 (CA9 2003). The warrant was concerned not with\nindividuals but with locations and property. In particular, the\nwarrant in this case authorized the search of 1363 Patricia Avenue\nand its surrounding grounds for, among other things, deadly weapons\nand evidence of street gang membership. In this respect, the\nwarrant here resembles that at issue in Michigan v. Summers , 452\nU. S. 692 (1981), which allowed the search of a residence for\ndrugs without mentioning any individual, including the owner of the\nhome whom police ultimately arrested. See People v. Summers , 407 Mich. 432, 440–443, 286 N. W. 2d 226,\n226–227 (1979), rev’d, Michigan v. Summers, supra. Summers makes clear that when a neutral\nmagistrate has determined police have probable cause to believe\ncontraband exists, “[t]he connection of an occupant to [a] home”\nalone “justifies a detention of that occupant.” 452 U. S., at\n703–704. Footnote 3 The Court of Appeals’ reliance on United\nStates v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U. S. 873 (1975), is\nmisplaced. Brignoni-Ponce held that stops by roving\npatrols near the border “may be justified on facts that do not\namount to the probable cause require[ment] for an arrest.” Id., at 880. We considered only whether the patrols had\nthe “authority to stop automobiles in areas near the\nMexican border,” id., at 874 (emphasis added), and\nexpressed no opinion as to the appropriateness of questioning when\nan individual was already seized. See United States v. Martinez&nbhyph;Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543 , 556–562\n(1976). We certainly did not, as the Court of Appeals suggested,\ncreate a “requirement of particularized reasonable suspicion for\npurposes of inquiry into citizenship status.” 332 F. 3d, at\n1267.",

CALIFORNIA et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the ninth circuit No. 03–636.Argued November 2, 2004—Decided February\n23, 2005 The California Department of Corrections’ (CDC)\nunwritten policy of racially segregating prisoners in double cells\nfor up to 60 days each time they enter a new correctional facility\nis based on the asserted rationale that it prevents violence caused\nby racial gangs. Petitioner Johnson, an African-American inmate who\nhas been intermittently double-celled under the policy’s terms ever\nsince his 1987 incarceration, filed this suit alleging that the\npolicy violates his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection.\nThe District Court ultimately granted defendant former CDC\nofficials summary judgment on grounds that they were entitled to\nqualified immunity. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the\npolicy’s constitutionality should be reviewed under the deferential\nstandard articulated in Turner v. Safley , 482 U. S. 78 , not\nunder strict scrutiny, and that the policy survived Turner scrutiny. Held: Strict scrutiny is the proper\nstandard of review for an equal protection challenge to the CDC’s\npolicy. Pp. 4–15. (a) Because the CDC’s policy\nis “immediately suspect” as an express racial classification, Shaw v. Reno , 509 U. S. 630 , 642, the\nNinth Circuit erred in failing to apply strict scrutiny and thereby\nto require the CDC to demonstrate that the policy is narrowly\ntailored to serve a compelling state interest, see Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pe&nacute;a , 515 U. S. 200 , 227. “[A]ll racial classifications [imposed by government] …\nmust be analyzed … under strict scrutiny,” ibid., in order\nto “ ‘smoke out’ illegitimate uses of race by assuring that\n[government] is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant [such]\na highly suspect tool,” Richmond v. J. A. Croson\nCo. , 488 U. S.\n469 , 493. The CDC’s claim that its policy should be exempt from\nthis categorical rule because it is “neutral”— i.e. ,\nbecause all prisoners are “equally” segregated—ignores this Court’s\nrepeated command that “racial classifications receive close\nscrutiny even when they may be said to burden or benefit the races\nequally,” Shaw, supra, at 651. Indeed, the Court rejected\nthe notion that separate can ever be equal—or “neutral”—50 years\nago in Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U. S. 483 , and\nrefuses to resurrect it today. The Court has previously applied a\nheightened standard of review in evaluating racial segregation in\nprisons. Lee v. Washington, 390 U. S. 333 . The need\nfor strict scrutiny is no less important here. By perpetuating the\nnotion that race matters most, racial segregation of inmates “may\nexacerbate the very patterns of [violence that it is] said to\ncounteract.” Shaw , supra , at 648. Virtually all\nother States and the Federal Government manage their prison systems\nwithout reliance on racial segregation. In fact, the United States\nargues that it is possible to address prison security concerns\nthrough individualized consideration without using racial\nsegregation, unless it is warranted as a necessary and temporary\nresponse to a serious threat of race-related violence. As to\ntransferees, in particular, whom the CDC has already evaluated at\nleast once, it is not clear why more individualized determinations\nare not possible. Pp. 4–9. (b) The Court declines the CDC’s\ninvitation to make an exception to the categorical strict scrutiny\nrule and instead to apply Turner ’s deferential review\nstandard on the ground that the CDC’s policy applies only in the\nprison context. The Court has never applied the Turner standard—which asks whether a regulation that burdens prisoners’\nfundamental rights is “reasonably related” to “legitimate\npenological interests,” 482 U. S., at 89—to racial classifications. Turner itself did not involve such a classification, and\nit cast no doubt on Lee . That is unsurprising, as the\nCourt has applied the Turner test only to rights\nthat are “inconsistent with proper incarceration.” Overton v. Bazzetta , 539 U. S. 126 , 131. The\nright not to be discriminated against based on one’s race is not\nsusceptible to Turner 's logic because it is not a right\nthat need necessarily be compromised for the sake of proper prison\nadministration. On the contrary, compliance with the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s ban on racial discrimination is not only consistent\nwith proper prison administration, but also bolsters the legitimacy\nof the entire criminal justice system. Cf. Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 , 99.\nDeference to the particular expertise of officials managing daily\nprison operations does not require a more relaxed standard here.\nThe Court did not relax the standard of review for racial\nclassifications in prison in Lee , and it refuses to do so\ntoday. Rather, it explicitly reaffirms that the “necessities of\nprison security and discipline,” Lee, supra , at\n334, are a compelling government interest justifying only those\nuses of race that are narrowly tailored to address those\nnecessities, see, e.g., Grutter v. Bollinger , 539 U. S. 306 , 353. Because Turner ’s standard would allow prison\nofficials to use race-based policies even when there are\nrace-neutral means to accomplish the same goal, and even when the\nrace-based policy does not in practice advance that goal, it is too\nlenient a standard to ferret out invidious uses of race. Contrary\nto the CDC’s protest, strict scrutiny will not render prison\nadministrators unable to address legitimate problems of race-based\nviolence in prisons. On remand, the CDC will have the burden of\ndemonstrating that its policy is narrowly tailored with regard to\nnew inmates as well as transferees. Pp. 9–15. (c) The Court does not decide whether the\nCDC’s policy violates equal protection, but leaves it to the Ninth\nCircuit, or the District Court, to apply strict scrutiny in the\nfirst instance. See, e.g., Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshall , 512 U. S. 532 , 557–558.\nP. 15. 321 F. 3d 791, reversed and remanded. O’Connor, J., delivered the\nopinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, and\nBreyer, JJ., joined. Ginsburg, J., filed a concurring opinion, in\nwhich Souter and Breyer, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a\ndissenting opinion. Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in\nwhich Scalia, J., joined. Rehnquist, C. J., took no part in\nthe decision of the case. OPINION OF THE COURT JOHNSON V. CALIFORNIA 543 U. S. ____ (2005) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 03-636 GARRISON S. JOHNSON, PETITIONER v. CALIFORNIA et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit [February 23, 2005] Justice O’Connor delivered the\nopinion of the Court. The California Department of\nCorrections (CDC) has an unwritten policy of racially segregating\nprisoners in double cells in reception centers for up to 60 days\neach time they enter a new correctional facility. We consider\nwhether strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review for an\nequal protection challenge to that policy. I A CDC institutions house all new\nmale inmates and all male inmates transferred from other state\nfacilities in reception centers for up to 60 days upon their\narrival. During that time, prison officials evaluate the inmates to\ndetermine their ultimate placement. Double-cell assignments in the\nreception centers are based on a number of factors, predominantly\nrace. In fact, the CDC has admitted that the chances of an inmate\nbeing assigned a cellmate of another race are “ ‘[p]retty\nclose’ ” to zero percent. App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a. The CDC\nfurther subdivides prisoners within each racial group. Thus,\nJapanese-Americans are housed separately from Chinese-Americans,\nand Northern California Hispanics are separated from Southern\nCalifornia Hispanics. The CDC’s asserted rationale for\nthis practice is that it is necessary to prevent violence caused by\nracial gangs. Brief for Respondents 1–6. It cites numerous\nincidents of racial violence in CDC facilities and identifies five\nmajor prison gangs in the State: Mexican Mafia, Nuestra Familia,\nBlack Guerilla Family, Aryan Brotherhood, and Nazi Low Riders. Id ., at 2. The CDC also notes that prison-gang culture is\nviolent and murderous. Id ., at 3. An associate warden\ntestified that if race were not considered in making initial\nhousing assignments, she is certain there would be racial conflict\nin the cells and in the yard. App. 215a. Other prison officials\nalso expressed their belief that violence and conflict would result\nif prisoners were not segregated. See, e.g., id., at\n305a–306a. The CDC claims that it must therefore segregate all\ninmates while it determines whether they pose a danger to others.\nSee Brief for Respondents 29. With the exception of the double cells in\nreception areas, the rest of the state prison facilities—dining\nareas, yards, and cells—are fully integrated. After the initial\n60-day period, prisoners are allowed to choose their own cellmates.\nThe CDC usually grants inmate requests to be housed together,\nunless there are security reasons for denying them. B Garrison Johnson is an\nAfrican-American inmate in the custody of the CDC. He has been\nincarcerated since 1987 and, during that time, has been housed at a\nnumber of California prison facilities. Fourth Amended Complaint 3,\nRecord, Doc. No. 78. Upon his arrival at Folsom prison in 1987, and\neach time he was transferred to a new facility thereafter, Johnson\nwas double-celled with another African-American inmate. See ibid . Johnson filed a complaint pro\nse in the United States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California on February 24, 1995, alleging that the\nCDC’s reception-center housing policy violated his right to equal\nprotection under the Fourteenth Amendment by assigning him\ncellmates on the basis of his race. He alleged that, from 1987 to\n1991, former CDC Director James Rowland instituted and enforced an\nunconstitutional policy of housing inmates according to race.\nSecond Amended Complaint 2–4, Record, Doc. No. 21. Johnson made the\nsame allegations against former Director James Gomez for the period\nfrom 1991 until the filing of his complaint. Ibid . The\nDistrict Court dismissed his complaint for failure to state a\nclaim. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and\nremanded, holding that Johnson had stated a claim for racial\ndiscrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Johnson v. California , 207\nF. 3d 650, 655 (2000). On remand, Johnson was appointed counsel and\ngranted leave to amend his complaint. On July 5, 2000, he filed his\nFourth Amended Complaint. Record, Doc. No. 81. Johnson claimed that\nthe CDC’s policy of racially segregating all inmates in\nreception-center cells violated his rights under the Equal\nProtection Clause. Johnson sought damages, alleging that former CDC\nDirectors Rowland and Gomez, in their individual capacities,\nviolated his constitutional rights by formulating and implementing\nthe CDC’s housing policy. He also sought injunctive relief against\nformer CDC Director Stephen Cambra. Johnson has consistently challenged, and the\nCDC has consistently defended, the policy as a whole—as it relates\nto both new inmates and inmates transferred from other facilities.\nJohnson was first segregated in 1987 as a new inmate when he\nentered the CDC facility at Folsom. Since 1987, he has been\nsegregated each time he has been transferred to a new facility.\nThus, he has been subject to the CDC’s policy both as a new inmate\nand as an inmate transferred from one facility to another. After discovery, the parties moved for summary\njudgment. The District Court granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants on grounds that they were entitled to qualified immunity\nbecause their conduct was not clearly unconstitutional. The Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 321 F. 3d 791\n(2003). It held that the constitutionality of the CDC’s policy\nshould be reviewed under the deferential standard we articulated in Turner v. Safley , 482 U. S. 78 (1987)—not strict\nscrutiny. 321 F. 3d, at 798–799. Applying Turner , it\nheld that Johnson had the burden of refuting the “common-sense\nconnection” between the policy and prison violence. 321 F. 3d,\nat 802. Though it believed this was a “close case,” id .,\nat 798, the Court of Appeals concluded that the policy survived Turner ’s deferential standard, 321 F. 3d, at 807. The Court of Appeals denied Johnson’s petition\nfor rehearing en banc. Judge Ferguson, joined by three others,\ndissented on grounds that “[t]he panel’s decision ignore[d] the\nSupreme Court’s repeated and unequivocal command that all racial\nclassifications imposed by the government must be analyzed by a\nreviewing court under strict scrutiny, and fail[ed] to recognize\nthat [the] Turner analysis is inapplicable in cases, such\nas this one, in which the right asserted is not inconsistent with\nlegitimate penological objectives.” 336 F. 3d 1117 (2003)\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We granted\ncertiorari to decide which standard of review applies. 540 U. S. 1217 (2004). II A We have held that “ all racial classifications [imposed by government] … must be analyzed\nby a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.” Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pe&nacute;a , 515 U. S. 200 , 227\n(1995) (emphasis added). Under strict scrutiny, the government has\nthe burden of proving that racial classifications “are narrowly\ntailored measures that further compelling governmental interests.” Ibid . We have insisted on strict scrutiny in every\ncontext, even for so-called “benign” racial classifications, such\nas race-conscious university admissions policies, see Grutter v. Bollinger , 539 U. S. 306 , 326\n(2003), race-based preferences in government contracts, see Adarand , supra , at 226, and race-based\ndistricting intended to improve minority representation, see Shaw v. Reno , 509 U. S. 630 , 650 (1993). The reasons for strict scrutiny\nare familiar. Racial classifications raise special fears that they\nare motivated by an invidious purpose. Thus, we have admonished\ntime and again that, “[a]bsent searching judicial inquiry into the\njustification for such race-based measures, there is simply no way\nof determining … what classifications are in fact motivated by\nillegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial\npolitics.” Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co. , 488 U. S. 469 ,\n493 (1989) (plurality opinion). We therefore apply strict scrutiny\nto all racial classifications to “ ‘smoke out’\nillegitimate uses of race by assuring that [government] is pursuing\na goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool.” Ibid .[ Footnote 1 ] The CDC claims that its policy should be\nexempt from our categorical rule because it is “neutral”—that is,\nit “neither benefits nor burdens one group or individual more than\nany other group or individual.” Brief for Respondents 16. In other\nwords, strict scrutiny should not apply because all prisoners are\n“equally” segregated. The CDC’s argument ignores our repeated\ncommand that “racial classifications receive close scrutiny even\nwhen they may be said to burden or benefit the races equally.” Shaw , supra , at 651. Indeed, we rejected the\nnotion that separate can ever be equal—or “neutral”—50 years ago in Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U. S. 483 (1954),\nand we refuse to resurrect it today. See also Powers v . Ohio , 499 U. S. 400 , 410\n(1991) (rejecting the argument that race-based peremptory\nchallenges were permissible because they applied equally to white\nand black jurors and holding that “[i]t is axiomatic that racial\nclassifications do not become legitimate on the assumption that all\npersons suffer them in equal degree”). We have previously applied a heightened\nstandard of review in evaluating racial segregation in prisons. In Lee v. Washington , 390 U. S. 333 (1968) (per curiam), we upheld a three-judge court’s decision\nstriking down Alabama’s policy of segregation in its prisons. Id ., at 333–334. Alabama had argued that desegregation\nwould undermine prison security and discipline, id ., at\n334, but we rejected that contention. Three Justices concurred “to\nmake explicit something that is left to be gathered only by\nimplication from the Court’s opinion”—“that prison authorities have\nthe right, acting in good faith and in particularized\ncircumstances , to take into account racial tensions in\nmaintaining security, discipline, and good order in prisons and\njails.” Ibid . (emphasis added). The concurring Justices\nemphasized that they were “unwilling to assume that state or local\nprison authorities might mistakenly regard such an explicit\npronouncement as evincing any dilution of this Court’s firm\ncommitment to the Fourteenth Amendment’s prohibition of racial\ndiscrimination.” Ibid . The need for strict scrutiny is no less\nimportant here, where prison officials cite racial violence as the\nreason for their policy. As we have recognized in the past, racial\nclassifications “threaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of\ntheir membership in a racial group and to incite racial\nhostility .” Shaw , supra , at 643 (citing J. A. Croson Co. , supra , at 493 (plurality\nopinion) (emphasis added)). Indeed, by insisting that inmates be\nhoused only with other inmates of the same race, it is possible\nthat prison officials will breed further hostility among prisoners\nand reinforce racial and ethnic divisions. By perpetuating the\nnotion that race matters most, racial segregation of inmates “may\nexacerbate the very patterns of [violence that it is] said to\ncounteract.” Shaw , supra , at 648; see also\nTrulson & Marquart, The Caged Melting Pot: Toward an\nUnderstanding of the Consequences of Desegregation in Prisons, 36\nLaw & Soc. Rev. 743, 774 (2002) (in a study of prison\ndesegregation, finding that “over [10 years] the rate of violence\nbetween inmates segregated by race in double cells surpassed the\nrate among those racially integrated”). See also Brief for Former\nState Corrections Officials as Amici Curiae 19 (opinion of\nformer corrections officials from six States that “racial\nintegration of cells tends to diffuse racial tensions and thus\ndiminish interracial violence” and that “a blanket policy of racial\nsegregation of inmates is contrary to sound prison\nmanagement”). The CDC’s policy is unwritten. Although\nCalifornia claimed at oral argument that two other States follow a\nsimilar policy, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 30–31, this assertion was\nunsubstantiated, and we are unable to confirm or deny its\naccuracy.[ Footnote 2 ] Virtually\nall other States and the Federal Government manage their prison\nsystems without reliance on racial segregation. See Brief for\nUnited States as Amicus Curiae 24. Federal regulations\ngoverning the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) expressly prohibit\nracial segregation. 28 CFR §551.90 (2004) (“[BOP] staff shall not\ndiscriminate against inmates on the basis of race, religion,\nnational origin, sex, disability, or political belief. This\nincludes the making of administrative decisions and providing\naccess to work, housing and programs”). The United States contends\nthat racial integration actually “leads to less violence in BOP’s\ninstitutions and better prepares inmates for re-entry into\nsociety.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25.\nIndeed, the United States argues, based on its experience with the\nBOP, that it is possible to address “concerns of prison security\nthrough individualized consideration without the use of racial\nsegregation, unless warranted as a necessary and temporary response\nto a race riot or other serious threat of race-related violence.” Id ., at 24. As to transferees, in particular, whom the CDC\nhas already evaluated at least once, it is not clear why more\nindividualized determinations are not possible. Because the CDC’s policy is an express racial\nclassification, it is “immediately suspect.” Shaw , 509 U.\nS., at 642; see also Washington v. Seattle School\nDist. No. 1 , 458 U. S. 457 , 485\n(1982). We therefore hold that the Court of Appeals erred when it\nfailed to apply strict scrutiny to the CDC’s policy and to require\nthe CDC to demonstrate that its policy is narrowly tailored to\nserve a compelling state interest. B The CDC invites us to make an\nexception to the rule that strict scrutiny applies to all racial\nclassifications, and instead to apply the deferential standard of\nreview articulated in Turner v. Safley , 482 U. S. 78 (1987), because its\nsegregation policy applies only in the prison context. We decline\nthe invitation. In Turner , we considered a claim by\nMissouri prisoners that regulations restricting inmate marriages\nand inmate-to-inmate correspondence were unconstitutional. Id ., at 81. We rejected the prisoners’ argument that the\nregulations should be subject to strict scrutiny, asking instead\nwhether the regulation that burdened the prisoners’ fundamental\nrights was “reasonably related” to “legitimate penological\ninterests.” Id ., at 89. We have never applied Turner to racial classifications. Turner itself\ndid not involve any racial classification, and it cast no doubt on Lee . We think this unsurprising, as we have applied Turner ’s reasonable-relationship test only to\nrights that are “inconsistent with proper incarceration.” Overton v. Bazzetta , 539 U. S. 126 , 131\n(2003); see also Pell v. Procunier , 417 U. S. 817 , 822\n(1974) (“[A] prison inmate retains those First Amendment rights\nthat are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the\nlegitimate penological objectives of the corrections system”). This\nis because certain privileges and rights must necessarily be\nlimited in the prison context. See O’Lone v. Estate of\nShabazz , 482 U.\nS. 342 , 348 (1987) (“ ‘[L]awful incarceration brings about\nthe necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and\nrights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our\npenal system’ ” (quoting Price v. Johnston ,\n334 U. S.266, 285 (1948))). Thus, for example, we have relied on Turner in addressing First Amendment challenges to prison\nregulations, including restrictions on freedom of association, Overton , supra; limits on inmate correspondence, Shaw v. Murphy , 532 U. S. 223 (2001);\nrestrictions on inmates’ access to courts, Lewis v. Casey , 518\nU. S. 343 (1996); restrictions on receipt of subscription\npublications, Thornburgh v. Abbott , 490 U. S. 401 (1989);\nand work rules limiting prisoners’ attendance at religious\nservices, Shabazz , supra . We have also applied Turner to some due process claims, such as involuntary\nmedication of mentally ill prisoners, Washington v. Harper , 494\nU. S. 210 (1990); and restrictions on the right to marry, Turner , supra . The right not to be discriminated against\nbased on one’s race is not susceptible to the logic of Turner . It is not a right that need necessarily be\ncompromised for the sake of proper prison administration. On the\ncontrary, compliance with the Fourteenth Amendment’s ban on racial\ndiscrimination is not only consistent with proper prison\nadministration, but also bolsters the legitimacy of the entire\ncriminal justice system. Race discrimination is “especially\npernicious in the administration of justice.” Rose v. Mitchell , 443 U. S. 545 , 555\n(1979). And public respect for our system of justice is undermined\nwhen the system discriminates based on race. Cf. Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 , 99 (1986)\n(“[P]ublic respect for our criminal justice system and the rule of\nlaw will be strengthened if we ensure that no citizen is\ndisqualified from jury service because of his race”). When\ngovernment officials are permitted to use race as a proxy for gang\nmembership and violence without demonstrating a compelling\ngovernment interest and proving that their means are narrowly\ntailored, society as a whole suffers. For similar reasons, we have\nnot used Turner to evaluate Eighth Amendment claims of\ncruel and unusual punishment in prison. We judge violations of that\nAmendment under the “deliberate indifference” standard, rather than Turner ’s “reasonably related” standard. See Hope v. Pelzer , 536 U. S. 730 , 738\n(2002) (asking whether prison officials displayed\n“ ‘deliberate indifference’ to the inmate’s health or safety”\nwhere an inmate claimed that they violated his rights under the\nEighth Amendment (quoting Hudson v. McMillian , 503 U. S. 1 , 8\n(1992))). This is because the integrity of the criminal justice\nsystem depends on full compliance with the Eighth Amendment. See Spain v. Procunier , 600 F. 2d 189, 193–194\n(CA9 1979) (Kennedy, J.) (“[T]he full protections of the eighth\namendment most certainly remain in force [in prison]. The whole\npoint of the amendment is to protect persons convicted of crimes. …\nMechanical deference to the findings of state prison officials in\nthe context of the eighth amendment would reduce that provision to\na nullity in precisely the context where it is most necessary”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). In the prison context, when the government’s\npower is at its apex, we think that searching judicial review of\nracial classifications is necessary to guard against invidious\ndiscrimination. Granting the CDC an exemption from the rule that\nstrict scrutiny applies to all racial classifications would\nundermine our “unceasing efforts to eradicate racial prejudice from\nour criminal justice system.” McCleskey v. Kemp , 481 U. S. 279 ,\n309 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). The CDC argues that “[d]eference to the\nparticular expertise of prison officials in the difficult task of\nmanaging daily prison operations” requires a more relaxed standard\nof review for its segregation policy. Brief for Respondents 18. But\nwe have refused to defer to state officials’ judgments on race in\nother areas where those officials traditionally exercise\nsubstantial discretion. For example, we have held that, despite the\nbroad discretion given to prosecutors when they use their\nperemptory challenges, using those challenges to strike jurors on\nthe basis of their race is impermissible. See Batson , supra , at 89–96. Similarly, in the redistricting context,\ndespite the traditional deference given to States when they design\ntheir electoral districts, we have subjected redistricting plans to\nstrict scrutiny when States draw district lines based predominantly\non race. Compare generally Vieth v. Jubilier , 541 U. S. 267 (2004) (partisan gerrymandering), with Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630 (1993) (racial\ngerrymandering). We did not relax the standard of review for\nracial classifications in prison in Lee , and we refuse to\ndo so today. Rather, we explicitly reaffirm what we implicitly held\nin Lee: The “necessities of prison security and\ndiscipline,” 390 U. S., at 334, are a compelling government\ninterest justifying only those uses of race that are narrowly\ntailored to address those necessities. See Grutter , 539 U.\nS., at 353 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart) (citing Lee for the principle that “protecting\nprisoners from violence might justify narrowly tailored racial\ndiscrimination”); J. A. Croson Co. , 488 U. S., at 521\n(Scalia, J., concurring) (citing Lee for the\nproposition that “only a social emergency rising to the level of\nimminent danger to life or limb—for example, a prison race riot,\nrequiring temporary segregation of inmates—can justify an exception\nto the principle embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment that ‘[o]ur\nConstitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates\nclasses among citizens’ ” (quoting Plessy v. Ferguson , 163 U. S. 537 , 559\n(1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting))); see also Pell , 417 U.\nS., at 823 (“[C]entral to all other corrections goals is the\ninstitutional consideration of internal security within the\ncorrectional facilities themselves”). Justice Thomas would subject race-based\npolicies in prisons to Turner ’s deferential standard of\nreview because, in his view, judgments about whether race-based\npolicies are necessary “are better left in the first instance to\nthe officials who run our Nation’s prisons.” Post , at 20.\nBut Turner is too lenient a standard to ferret out\ninvidious uses of race. Turner requires only that the\npolicy be “reasonably related” to “legitimate penological\ninterests.” 482 U. S., at 89. Turner would allow prison\nofficials to use race-based policies even when there are\nrace-neutral means to accomplish the same goal, and even when the\nrace-based policy does not in practice advance that goal. See, e.g. , 321 F. 3d, at 803 (case below) (reasoning that,\nunder Turner , the Court of Appeals did “not have to agree\nthat the policy actually advances the CDC’s legitimate interest,\nbut only [that] ‘defendants might reasonably have thought that the\npolicy would advance its interests’ ”). See also Turner , supra , at 90 (warning that Turner is not a “least restrictive alternative test”\n(internal quotation marks omitted)). For example, in Justice Thomas’ world, prison\nofficials could segregate visiting areas on the ground that racial\nmixing would cause unrest in the racially charged prison\natmosphere. Under Turner , “[t]he prisoner would have to\nprove that there would not be a riot. [But] [i]t is\ncertainly ‘plausible’ that such a riot could ensue: our society, as\nwell as our prisons, contains enough racists that almost any\ninterracial interaction could potentially lead to conflict.” 336\nF. 3d, at 1120 (case below) (Ferguson, J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc). Indeed, under Justice Thomas’ view,\nthere is no obvious limit to permissible segregation in prisons. It\nis not readily apparent why, if segregation in reception centers is\njustified, segregation in the dining halls, yards, and general\nhousing areas is not also permissible. Any of these areas could be\nthe potential site of racial violence. If Justice Thomas’ approach\nwere to carry the day, even the blanket segregation policy struck\ndown in Lee might stand a chance of survival if prison\nofficials simply asserted that it was necessary to prison\nmanagement. We therefore reject the Turner standard for\nracial classifications in prisons because it would make rank\ndiscrimination too easy to defend. The CDC protests that strict scrutiny will\nhandcuff prison administrators and render them unable to address\nlegitimate problems of race-based violence in prisons. See also post , at 9, 24–25 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Not so. Strict\nscrutiny is not “strict in theory, but fatal in fact.” Adarand , 515 U. S., at 237 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Grutter , 539 U. S., at 326–327 (“Although all\ngovernmental uses of race are subject to strict scrutiny, not all\nare invalidated by it”). Strict scrutiny does not preclude the\nability of prison officials to address the compelling interest in\nprison safety. Prison administrators, however, will have to\ndemonstrate that any race-based policies are narrowly tailored to\nthat end. See id. , at 327 (“When race-based action is\nnecessary to further a compelling governmental interest, such\naction does not violate the constitutional guarantee of equal\nprotection so long as the narrow-tailoring requirement is also\nsatisfied”).[ Footnote 3 ] The fact that strict scrutiny applies “says\nnothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law; that\ndetermination is the job of the court applying strict scrutiny.” Adarand , supra , at 229–230. At this juncture, no\nsuch determination has been made. On remand, the CDC will have the\nburden of demonstrating that its policy is narrowly tailored with\nregard to new inmates as well as transferees. Prisons are dangerous\nplaces, and the special circumstances they present may justify\nracial classifications in some contexts. Such circumstances can be\nconsidered in applying strict scrutiny, which is designed to take\nrelevant differences into account. III We do not decide whether the\nCDC’s policy violates the Equal Protection Clause. We hold only\nthat strict scrutiny is the proper standard of review and remand\nthe case to allow the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, or\nthe District Court, to apply it in the first instance. See Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Gottshal , 512 U. S. 532 ,\n557–558 (1994) (reversing and remanding for the lower court to\napply the correct legal standard in the first instance); Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council , 505 U. S. 1003 ,\n1031–1032 (1992) (same). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. The Chief Justice took no part in\nthe decision of this case. Footnote 1 Justice Thomas takes a hands-off approach to\nracial classifications in prisons, suggesting that a “compelling\nshowing [is] needed to overcome the deference we owe",

PERRY, GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, et al. appeal from the united states district court for\nthe eastern district of texas No. 05–204. Argued March 1, 2006—Decided June 28,\n2006 The 1990 census resulted in a 3-seat increase over\nthe 27 seats previously allotted the Texas congressional\ndelegation. Although the Democratic Party then controlled 19 of\nthose 27 seats, as well as both state legislative houses and the\ngovernorship, change was in the air: The Republican Party had\nreceived 47% of the 1990 statewide vote, while the Democrats had\nreceived only 51%. Faced with a possible Republican ascent to\nmajority status, the legislature drew a congressional redistricting\nplan that favored Democratic candidates. The Republicans challenged\nthe 1991 Plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, but to\nno avail. The 2000 census authorized\ntwo additional seats for the Texas delegation. The Republicans then\ncontrolled the governorship and the State Senate, but did not yet\ncontrol the State House of Representatives. So constituted, the\nlegislature was unable to pass a redistricting scheme, resulting in\nlitigation and the necessity of a court-ordered plan to comply with\nthe U. S. Constitution’s one-person, one-vote requirement.\nConscious that the primary responsibility for drawing congressional\ndistricts lies with the political branches of government, and\nhesitant to undo the work of one political party for the benefit of\nanother, the three-judge Federal District Court sought to apply\nonly “neutral” redistricting standards when drawing Plan 1151C,\nincluding placing the two new seats in high-growth areas, following\ncounty and voting precinct lines, and avoiding the pairing of\nincumbents. Under Plan 1151C, the 2002 congressional elections\nresulted in a 17-to-15 Democratic majority in the Texas delegation,\ncompared to a 59% to 40% Republican majority in votes for statewide\noffice in 2000, thus leaving the 1991 Democratic gerrymander\nlargely in place. In 2003, however, Texas\nRepublicans gained control of both houses of the legislature and\nset out to increase Republican representation in the congressional\ndelegation. After a protracted partisan struggle, the legislature\nenacted a new congressional districting map, Plan 1374C. In the\n2004 congressional elections, Republicans won 21 seats to the\nDemocrats’ 11, while also obtaining 58% of the vote in statewide\nraces against the Democrats’ 41%. Soon after Plan 1374C was\nenacted, appellants challenged it in court, alleging a host of\nconstitutional and statutory violations. In 2004 the District Court\nentered judgment for appellees, but this Court vacated the decision\nand remanded for consideration in light of Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541\nU. S. 267 . On remand, the District Court, believing the scope\nof its mandate was limited to questions of political\ngerrymandering, again rejected appellants’ claims. Held: The judgment is affirmed in\npart, reversed in part, and vacated in part, and the cases are\nremanded. 399 F. Supp. 2d 756, affirmed in part,\nreversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. Justice Kennedy delivered the\nopinion of the Court with respect to Parts II–A and III,\nconcluding: 1. This Court held, in Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109 , 118–127,\nthat an equal protection challenge to a political gerrymander\npresents a justiciable case or controversy, although it could not\nagree on what substantive standard to apply, compare id., at 127–137, with id., at 161–162. That disagreement\npersists. The Vieth plurality would have held such\nchallenges nonjusticiable political questions, but a majority\ndeclined to do so, see 541 U. S., at 306, 317, 343, 355.\nJusticiability is not revisited here. At issue is whether\nappellants offer a manageable, reliable measure of fairness for\ndetermining whether a partisan gerrymander is unconstitutional. P.\n7. 2. Texas’ redrawing of District 23’s\nlines amounts to vote dilution violative of §2 of the Voting Rights\nAct of 1965. Pp. 17–36. (a) Plan 1374C’s\nchanges to District 23 served the dual goals of increasing\nRepublican seats and protecting the incumbent Republican against an\nincreasingly powerful Latino population that threatened to oust\nhim, with the additional political nuance that he would be\nreelected in a district that had a Latino majority as to voting age\npopulation, though not a Latino majority as to citizen voting age\npopulation or an effective Latino voting majority. The District 23\nchanges required adjustments elsewhere, so the State created new\nDistrict 25 to avoid retrogression under §5 of the Act.\nPp. 17–18. (b) A State violates §2\n“if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown that the\npolitical processes leading to nomination or election … are not\n[as] equally open to … members of [a racial group as they are to]\nother members of the electorate.” 42 U. S. C. §1973(b). Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 , 50–51,\nidentified three threshold conditions for establishing a §2\nviolation: (1) the racial group must be “sufficiently large and\ngeographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member\ndistrict”; (2) the group must be “politically cohesive”; and (3)\nthe white majority must “vot[e] sufficiently as a bloc to enable it\n… usually to defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.” The\nlegislative history identifies factors that courts can use, once\nall three threshold requirements are met, in interpreting §2’s\n“totality of circumstances” standard, including the State’s history\nof voting-related discrimination, the extent to which voting is\nracially polarized, and the extent to which the State has used\nvoting practices or procedures that tend to enhance the opportunity\nfor discrimination against the minority group. See id., at\n44–45. Another relevant consideration is whether the number of\ndistricts in which the minority group forms an effective majority\nis roughly proportional to its share of the population in the\nrelevant area. Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997 , 1000. The\ndistrict court’s determination whether the §2 requirements are\nsatisfied must be upheld unless clearly erroneous. See Gingles,\nsupra , at 78–79. Where “the ultimate finding of dilution” is\nbased on “a misreading of the governing law,” however, there is\nreversible error. De Grandy, supra , at 1022.\nPp. 18–20. (c) Appellants have\nsatisfied all three Gingles requirements as to District\n23, and the creation of new District 25 does not remedy the\nproblem. The second and third Gingles factors—Latino cohesion, majority bloc voting—are present, given\nthe District Court’s finding of racially polarized voting in the\nDistrict 23 and throughout the State. As to the first Gingles precondition—that the minority group be large and\ncompact enough to constitute a majority in a single-member\ndistrict, 478 U. S., at 50—appellants have established that Latinos\ncould have had an opportunity district in District 23 had its lines\nnot been altered and that they do not have one now. They\nconstituted a majority of the citizen voting age population in\nDistrict 23 under Plan 1151C. The District Court suggested\nincorrectly that the district was not a Latino opportunity district\nin 2002 simply because the incumbent prevailed. The fact that a\ngroup does not win elections does not resolve the vote dilution\nissue. De Grandy, 512 U. S. , at 1014, n. 11.\nIn old District 23 the increase in Latino voter registration and\noverall population, the concomitant rise in Latino voting power in\neach successive election, the near victory of the Latino candidate\nof choice in 2002, and the resulting threat to the incumbent’s\ncontinued election were the very reasons the State redrew the\ndistrict lines. Since the redistricting prevented the immediate\nsuccess of the emergent Latino majority in District 23, there was a\ndenial of opportunity in the real sense of that term. Plan 1374C’s\nversion of District 23, by contrast, is unquestionably not a Latino\nopportunity district. That Latinos are now a bare majority of the\ndistrict’s voting-age population is not dispositive, since the\nrelevant numbers must account for citizenship in order to determine\nthe group’s opportunity to elect candidates, and Latinos do not now\nhave a citizen voting-age majority in the district. The State’s argument that it met its §2\nobligations by creating new District 25 as an offsetting\nopportunity district is rejected. In a district line-drawing\nchallenge, “the first Gingles condition requires the\npossibility of creating more than the existing number of reasonably\ncompact districts with a sufficiently large minority population to\nelect candidates of its choice.” Id., at 1008. The\nDistrict Court’s finding that the current plan contains six Latino\nopportunity districts and that seven reasonably compact districts,\nas proposed by appellant GI Forum, could not be drawn was not\nclearly erroneous. However, the court failed to perform the\nrequired compactness inquiry between the number of Latino\nopportunity districts under the challenger’s proposal of\nreinstating Plan 1151C and the “existing number of reasonably\ncompact districts.” Ibid. Section 2 does not forbid the\ncreation of a noncompact majority-minority district, Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952 , 999, but\nsuch a district cannot remedy a violation elsewhere in the State,\nsee Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899 , 916. The\nlower court recognized there was a 300-mile gap between the two\nLatino communities in District 25, and a similarly large gap\nbetween the needs and interests of the two groups. The court’s\nconclusion that the relative smoothness of the district lines made\nthe district compact, despite this combining of discrete\ncommunities of interest, is inapposite because the court analyzed\nthe issue only in the equal protection context, where compactness\nfocuses on the contours of district lines to determine whether race\nwas the predominant factor in drawing those lines. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900 , 916–917.\nUnder §2, by contrast, the injury is vote dilution, so the\ncompactness inquiry considers “the compactness of the minority\npopulation, not … the compactness of the contested district.” Vera, 517 U. S., at 997. A district that “reaches out to\ngrab small and apparently isolated minority communities” is not\nreasonably compact. Id., at 979. The lower court’s\nfindings regarding the different characteristics, needs, and\ninterests of the two widely scattered Latino communities in\nDistrict 23 are well supported and uncontested. The enormous\ngeographical distances separating the two communities, coupled with\nthe disparate needs and interests of these populations—not either\nfactor alone—renders District 25 noncompact for §2 purposes.\nTherefore, Plan 1374C contains only five reasonably compact Latino\nopportunity districts, one fewer than Plan 1151C.\nPp. 20–29. (d) The totality of the\ncircumstances demonstrates a §2 violation. The relevant\nproportionality inquiry, see De Grandy, 512 U.\nS. , at 1000, compares the percentage of total districts\nthat are Latino opportunity districts with the Latino share of the\ncitizen voting-age population. The State’s contention that\nproportionality should be decided on a regional basis is rejected\nin favor of appellants’ assertion that their claim requires a\nstatewide analysis because they have alleged statewide vote\ndilution based on a statewide plan. Looking statewide, there are 32\ncongressional districts. The five reasonably compact Latino\nopportunity districts amount to roughly 16% of the total, while\nLatinos make up 22% of Texas’ citizen voting-age population.\nLatinos are, therefore, two districts shy of proportional\nrepresentation. Even deeming this disproportionality insubstantial\nwould not overcome the other evidence of vote dilution for Latinos\nin District 23. The changes there undermined the progress of a\nracial group that has been subject to significant voting-related\ndiscrimination and that was becoming increasingly politically\nactive and cohesive. Cf., e.g., id., at 1014. Against this\nbackground, the Latinos’ diminishing electoral support for the\nincumbent indicates their belief he was unresponsive to their\nparticularized needs. In essence, the State took away their\nopportunity because they were about to exercise it. Even accepting\nthe District Court’s finding that the State’s action was taken\nprimarily for political, not racial, reasons, the redrawing of\nDistrict 23’s lines was damaging to its Latino voters. The State\nnot only made fruitless the Latinos’ mobilization efforts but also\nacted against those Latinos who were becoming most politically\nactive. Although incumbency protection can be a legitimate factor\nin districting, see Karcher v. Daggett , 462 U. S. 725 , 740, not\nall of its forms are in the interests of the constituents. If, as\nhere, such protection means excluding some voters from the district\nsimply because they are likely to vote against the officeholder,\nthe change is to benefit the officeholder, not the voters. This\npolicy, whatever its validity in the political realm, cannot\njustify the effect on Latino voters. See Gingles, supra ,\nat 45. Pp. 29–36. (e) Because Plan 1374C\nviolates §2 in its redrawing of District 23, appellants’ First\nAmendment and equal protection claims with respect to that district\nneed not be addressed. Their equal protection claim as to the\ndrawing of District 25 need not be confronted because that district\nwill have to be redrawn to remedy the District 23 violation.\nPp. 36–37. Justice Kennedy concluded in Part II that\nbecause appellants have established no legally impermissible use of\npolitical classifications, they state no claim on which relief may\nbe granted as to their contention that Texas’ statewide\nredistricting is an unconstitutional political gerrymander. Justice\nSouter and Justice Ginsburg joined Part II–D. Pp. 7–15. (a) Article I of the Constitution, §§2\nand 4, gives “the States primary responsibility for apportionment\nof their … congressional … districts,” Growe v. Emison, 507\nU. S. 25 , 34, but §4 also permits Congress to set further\nrequirements. Neither the Constitution nor Congress has stated any\nexplicit prohibition of mid-decade redistricting to change\ndistricts drawn earlier in conformance with a decennial census.\nAlthough the legislative branch plays the primary role in\ncongressional redistricting, courts have an important role when a\ndistricting plan violates the Constitution. See, e.g. , Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1 . That the\nfederal courts sometimes must order legislative redistricting,\nhowever, does not shift the primary responsibility away from\nlegislative bodies, see, e.g., Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U. S. 535 , 540, who\nare free to replace court-mandated remedial plans by enacting\nredistricting plans of their own, see, e.g. , Upham v. Seamon, 456 U. S. 37 , 44.\nJudicial respect for legislative plans, however, cannot justify\nlegislative reliance on improper criteria for districting\ndeterminations. Pp. 7–10. (b) Appellants claim unpersuasively that\na decision to effect mid-decennial redistricting, when solely\nmotivated by partisan objectives, presumptively violates equal\nprotection and the First Amendment because it serves no legitimate\npublic purpose and burdens one group because of its political\nopinions and affiliation. For a number of reasons, that test is\nunconvincing. There is some merit to the State’s assertion that\npartisan gain was not the sole motivation for replacing Plan 1151C:\nThe contours of some contested district lines seem to have been\ndrawn based on more mundane and local interests, and a number of\nline-drawing requests by Democratic state legislators were honored.\nMoreover, a successful test for identifying unconstitutional\npartisan gerrymandering must do what appellants’ sole-motivation\ntheory explicitly disavows: show a burden, as measured by a\nreliable standard, on the complainants’ representational rights.\nSee Vieth, supra , at 292–295, 307–308. Appellants’\nsole-intent standard is no more compelling when it is linked to the\ncircumstance that Plan 1374C is mid-decennial legislation. The\nConstitution’s text and structure and this Court’s cases indicate\nthere is nothing inherently suspect about a legislature’s decision\nto replace mid-decade a court-ordered plan with one of its own.\nEven if there were, the fact of mid-decade redistricting alone is\nno sure indication of unlawful political gerrymanders. Appellants’\ntest would leave untouched the 1991 Texas redistricting, which\nentrenched a party on the verge of minority status, while striking\ndown the 2003 redistricting plan, which resulted in the majority\nRepublican Party capturing a larger share of the seats. A test that\ntreats these two similarly effective power plays in such different\nways does not have the reliability appellants ascribe to it.\nPp. 10–14. (c) Appellants’ political gerrymandering\ntheory that mid-decade redistricting for exclusively partisan\npurposes violates the one-person, one-vote requirement is rejected.\nAlthough conceding that States operate under the legal fiction that\ntheir plans are constitutionally apportioned throughout a decade,\nsee, e.g., Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461 , 488, n. 2,\nappellants contend that this fiction should not provide a safe\nharbor for a legislature that enacts a voluntary, mid-decade plan\noverriding a legal court-drawn plan. This argument mirrors\nappellants’ attack on mid-decennial redistricting solely motivated\nby partisan considerations and is unsatisfactory for the same\nreasons. Their further contention that the legislature\nintentionally sought to manipulate population variances when it\nenacted Plan 1374C is unconvincing because there is no District\nCourt finding to that effect, and they present no specific evidence\nto support this serious allegation of bad faith. Because they have\nnot demonstrated that the legislature’s decision to enact Plan\n1374C constitutes a violation of the equal-population requirement,\ntheir subsidiary reliance on Larios v. Cox , 300\nF. Supp. 2d 1320, summarily aff’d, 542 U. S. 947 , is\nunavailing. Pp. 14–16. Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice\nand Justice Alito, concluded in Part IV that the Dallas area\nredistricting does not violate §2 of the Voting Rights Act.\nAppellants allege that the Dallas changes dilute African-American\nvoting strength because an African-American minority effectively\ncontrolled District 24 under Plan 1151C. However, before Plan\n1374C, District 24 had elected an Anglo Democrat to Congress in\nevery election since 1978. Since then, moreover, the incumbent has\nhad no opposition in any of his primary elections, and\nAfrican-Americans have consistently voted for him.\nAfrican-Americans were the second-largest racial group in the\ndistrict after Anglos, but had only 25.7% of the citizen voting age\npopulation. Even assuming that the first Gingles prong can\naccommodate appellants’ assertion that a §2 claim may be stated for\na racial group that makes up less than 50% of the population, see, e.g., De Grandy, supra , at 1009, they must show they\nconstitute “a sufficiently large minority to elect their candidate\nof choice with the assistance of cross-over votes,” Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146 , 158. The\nDistrict Court committed no clear error in rejecting questionable\nevidence that African-Americans have the ability to elect their\ncandidate of choice in favor of other evidence that an\nAfrican-American candidate of choice would not prevail. See Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S. 564 , 574. That\nAfrican-Americans had influence in the district does not suffice to\nstate a §2 claim. If it did, it would unnecessarily infuse race\ninto virtually every redistricting, raising serious constitutional\nquestions. See Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U. S. 461 , 491. Id., at\n480, 482, distinguished. Appellants do not raise a\ndistrict-specific political gerrymandering claim against District\n24. Pp. 37–41. The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Alito,\nagreed that appellants have not provided a reliable standard for\nidentifying unconstitutional political gerrymanders, but noted that\nthe question whether any such standard exists— i.e., whether a challenge to such a gerrymander presents a justiciable\ncase or controversy—has not been argued in these cases. The Chief\nJustice and Justice Alito therefore take no position on that\nquestion, which has divided the Court, see Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541\nU. S. 267 , and join the plurality’s Part II disposition without\nspecifying whether appellants have failed to state a claim on which\nrelief can be granted or failed to present a justiciable\ncontroversy. Pp. 1–2. Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas,\nconcluded that appellants’ claims of unconstitutional political\ngerrymandering do not present a justiciable case or controversy,\nsee Vieth v. Jubelirer , 541\nU. S. 267 , 271–306 (plurality opinion), and that their\nvote-dilution claims premised on §2 of the Voting Rights Act of\n1965 lack merit for the reasons set forth in Justice Thomas’s\nopinion concurring in the judgment in Holder v. Hall , 512\nU. S. 874 , 891–946. Reviewing appellants’ race-based equal\nprotection claims, Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice,\nJustice Thomas, and Justice Alito, concluded that the District\nCourt did not commit clear error in rejecting appellant GI Forum’s\nassertion that the removal of Latino residents from District 23\nconstituted intentional vote dilution. Justice Scalia, joined by\nThe Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, subjected the\nintentional creation of District 25 as a majority-minority district\nto strict scrutiny and held that standard satisfied because\nappellants conceded that the creation of this district was\nreasonably necessary to comply with §5 of the Voting Rights Act of\n1965, which is a compelling state interest, and did not argue that\nTexas did more than that provision required it to do.\nPp. 2–11.

GI FORUM OF TEXAS, et al., APPELLANTS 05–439 v. RICK PERRY, GOVERNOR OF TEXAS,\net al. on appeals from the united states district\ncourt for the eastern district of texas [June 28, 2006] Justice Kennedy announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of\nthe Court with respect to Parts II–A and III, an opinion with\nrespect to Parts I and IV, in which The Chief Justice and Justice\nAlito join, an opinion with respect to Parts II–B and II–C, and an\nopinion with respect to Part II–D, in which Justice Souter and\nJustice Ginsburg join. These four consolidated cases are\nappeals from a judgment entered by the United States District Court\nfor the Eastern District of Texas. Convened as a three-judge court\nunder 28 U. S. C. §2284, the court heard appellants’\nconstitutional and statutory challenges to a 2003 enactment of the\nTexas State Legislature that drew new district lines for the 32\nseats Texas holds in the United States House of Representatives.\n(Though appellants do not join each other as to all claims, for the\nsake of convenience we refer to appellants collectively.) In 2004\nthe court entered judgment for appellees and issued detailed\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law. Session v. Perry , 298 F. Supp. 2d 451 (per curiam). This Court vacated that decision and remanded for consideration in\nlight of Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U. S. 267 (2004). 543 U. S. 941 (2004). The District\nCourt reexamined appellants’ political gerrymandering claims and,\nin a second careful opinion, again held for the defendants. Henderson v. Perry , 399 F. Supp. 2d 756\n(2005). These appeals followed, and we noted probable jurisdiction.\n546 U. S. ___ (2005). Appellants contend the new plan is an\nunconstitutional partisan gerrymander and that the redistricting\nstatewide violates §2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat.\n437, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §1973. Appellants also contend\nthat the use of race and politics in drawing lines of specific\ndistricts violates the First Amendment and the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The three-judge panel,\nconsisting of Circuit Judge Higginbotham and District Judges Ward\nand Rosenthal, brought considerable experience and expertise to the\ninstant case, based on their knowledge of the State’s people,\nhistory, and geography. Judges Higginbotham and Ward, moreover, had\nserved on the three-judge court that drew the plan the Texas\nLegislature replaced in 2003, so they were intimately familiar with\nthe history and intricacies of the cases. We affirm the District Court’s dispositions on\nthe statewide political gerrymandering claims and the Voting Rights\nAct claim against District 24. We reverse and remand on the Voting\nRights Act claim with respect to District 23. Because we do not\nreach appellants’ race-based equal protection claim or the\npolitical gerrymandering claim as to District 23, we vacate the\njudgment of the District Court on these claims. I To set out a proper framework for\nthe case, we first recount the history of the litigation and recent\ndistricting in Texas. An appropriate starting point is not the\nreapportionment in 2000 but the one from the census in 1990. The 1990 census resulted in a\n30-seat congressional delegation for Texas, an increase of 3 seats\nover the 27 representatives allotted to the State in the decade\nbefore. See Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952 , 956–957\n(1996). In 1991 the Texas Legislature drew new district lines. At\nthe time, the Democratic Party controlled both houses in the state\nlegislature, the governorship, and 19 of the State’s 27 seats in\nCongress. Yet change appeared to be on the horizon. In the previous\n30 years the Democratic Party’s post-Reconstruction dominance over\nthe Republican Party had eroded, and by 1990 the Republicans\nreceived 47% of the statewide vote, while the Democrats received\n51%. Henderson , supra , at 763; Brief for Appellee\nPerry et al. in No. 05–204, etc., p. 2 (hereinafter Brief\nfor State Appellees). Faced with a Republican opposition that could\nbe moving toward majority status, the state legislature drew a\ncongressional redistricting plan designed to favor Democratic\ncandidates. Using then-emerging computer technology to draw\ndistrict lines with artful precision, the legislature enacted a\nplan later described as the “shrewdest gerrymander of the 1990s.”\nM. Barone, R. Cohen, & C. Cook, Almanac of American Politics\n2002, p. 1448 (2001). See Henderson , supra , at\n767, and n. 47. Although the 1991 plan was enacted by the state\nlegislature, Democratic Congressman Martin Frost was acknowledged\nas its architect. Session , supra , at 482. The\n1991 plan “carefully constructs democratic districts ‘with\nincredibly convoluted lines’ and packs ‘heavily Republican’\nsuburban areas into just a few districts.” Henderson , supra , at 767, n. 47 (quoting M. Barone & R. Cohen,\nAlmanac of American Politics 2004, p. 1510 (2003) (hereinafter 2004\nAlmanac)). Voters who considered this unfair and unlawful\ntreatment sought to invalidate the 1991 plan as an unconstitutional\npartisan gerrymander, but to no avail. See Terrazas v. Slagle , 789 F. Supp. 828, 833 (WD Tex. 1992); Terrazas v. Slagle , 821 F. Supp. 1162, 1175\n(WD Tex. 1993). The 1991 plan realized the hopes of Democrats and\nthe fears of Republicans with respect to the composition of the\nTexas congressional delegation. The 1990’s were years of continued\ngrowth for the Texas Republican Party, and by the end of the decade\nit was sweeping elections for statewide office. Nevertheless,\ndespite carrying 59% of the vote in statewide elections in 2000,\nthe Republicans only won 13 congressional seats to the Democrats’\n17. Henderson , supra , at 763. These events likely were not forgotten by\neither party when it came time to draw congressional districts in\nconformance with the 2000 census and to incorporate two additional\nseats for the Texas delegation. The Republican Party controlled the\ngovernorship and the State Senate; it did not yet control the State\nHouse of Representatives, however. As so constituted, the\nlegislature was unable to pass a redistricting scheme, resulting in\nlitigation and the necessity of a court-ordered plan to comply with\nthe Constitution’s one-person, one-vote requirement. See Balderas v. Texas , Civ. Action No. 6:01CV158 (ED\nTex., Nov. 14, 2001) (per curiam), summarily aff’d, 536 U. S. 919 (2002), App. E to Juris.\nStatement in No. 05–276, p. 202a. The congressional districting map\nresulting from the Balderas litigation is known as Plan\n1151C. As we have said, two members of the\nthree-judge court that drew Plan 1151C later served on the\nthree-judge court that issued the judgment now under review. Thus\nwe have the benefit of their candid comments concerning the\nredistricting approach taken in the Balderas litigation.\nConscious that the primary responsibility for drawing congressional\ndistricts is given to political branches of government, and\nhesitant to “und[o] the work of one political party for the benefit\nof another,” the three-judge Balderas court sought to\napply “only ‘neutral’ redistricting standards” when drawing Plan\n1151C. Henderson , 399 F. Supp. 2d, at 768. Once the\nDistrict Court applied these principles—such as placing the two new\nseats in high-growth areas, following county and voting precinct\nlines, and avoiding the pairing of incumbents—“the drawing ceased,\nleaving the map free of further change except to conform it to\none-person, one-vote.” Ibid. Under Plan 1151C, the 2002\ncongressional elections resulted in a 17-to-15 Democratic majority\nin the Texas delegation, compared to a 59% to 40% Republican\nmajority in votes for statewide office in 2000. Id. , at\n763–764. Reflecting on the Balderas Plan, the District\nCourt in Henderson was candid to acknowledge “[t]he\npractical effect of this effort was to leave the 1991 Democratic\nParty gerrymander largely in place as a ‘legal’ plan.” Id. , at 768. The continuing influence of a court-drawn map\nthat “perpetuated much of [the 1991] gerrymander,” ibid. ,\nwas not lost on Texas Republicans when, in 2003, they gained\ncontrol of the State House of Representatives and, thus, both\nhouses of the legislature. The Republicans in the legislature “set\nout to increase their representation in the congressional\ndelegation.” Session , 298 F. Supp. 2d, at 471. See\nalso id ., at 470 (“There is little question but that the\nsingle-minded purpose of the Texas Legislature in enacting [a new\nplan] was to gain partisan advantage”). After a protracted partisan\nstruggle, during which Democratic legislators left the State for a\ntime to frustrate quorum requirements, the legislature enacted a\nnew congressional districting map in October 2003. It is called\nPlan 1374C. The 2004 congressional elections did not disappoint the\nplan’s drafters. Republicans won 21 seats to the Democrats’ 11,\nwhile also obtaining 58% of the vote in statewide races against the\nDemocrats’ 41%. Henderson , supra , at 764. Soon after Texas enacted Plan\n1374C, appellants challenged it in court, alleging a host of\nc",

UNITED\nSTATES certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the sixth circuit No. 04–1034. Argued February 21, 2006—Decided June\n19, 2006 As relevant here, the Clean Water Act (CWA or Act)\nmakes it unlawful to discharge dredged or fill material into\n“navigable waters” without a permit, 33 U. S. C. §§1311(a),\n1342(a), and defines “navigable waters” as “the waters of the\nUnited States, including the territorial seas,” §1362(7). The Army\nCorps of Engineers (Corps), which issues permits for the discharge\nof dredged or fill material into navigable waters, interprets “the\nwaters of the United States” expansively to include not only\ntraditional navigable waters, 33 CFR §328.3(a)(1), but also other\ndefined waters, §328.3(a)(2), (3); “[t]ributaries” of such waters,\n§328.3(a)(5); and wetlands “adjacent” to such waters and\ntributaries, §328.3(a)(7). “[A]djacent” wetlands include those\n“bordering, contiguous [to], or neighboring” waters of the United\nStates even when they are “separated from [such] waters … by\nman-made dikes … and the like.” §328.3(c). These cases involve four\nMichigan wetlands lying near ditches or man-made drains that\neventually empty into traditional navigable waters. In No. 04–1034,\nthe United States brought civil enforcement proceedings against the\nRapanos petitioners, who had backfilled three of the areas without\na permit. The District Court found federal jurisdiction over the\nwetlands because they were adjacent to “waters of the United\nStates” and held petitioners liable for CWA violations. Affirming,\nthe Sixth Circuit found federal jurisdiction based on the sites’\nhydrologic connections to the nearby ditches or drains, or to more\nremote navigable waters. In No. 04–1384, the Carabell petitioners\nwere denied a permit to deposit fill in a wetland that was\nseparated from a drainage ditch by an impermeable berm. The\nCarabells sued, but the District Court found federal jurisdiction\nover the site. Affirming, the Sixth Circuit held that the wetland\nwas adjacent to navigable waters. Held: The judgments are vacated, and\nthe cases are remanded. No. 04–1034, 376 F. 3d 629, and No. 04–1384,\n391 F. 3d 704, vacated and remanded. Justice Scalia, joined by The\nChief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, concluded: 1. The phrase “the waters of the United\nStates” includes only those relatively permanent, standing or\ncontinuously flowing bodies of water “forming geographic features”\nthat are described in ordinary parlance as “streams,” “oceans,\nrivers, [and] lakes,” Webster’s New International Dictionary 2882\n(2d ed.), and does not include channels through which water flows\nintermittently or ephemerally, or channels that periodically\nprovide drainage for rainfall. The Corps’ expansive interpretation\nof that phrase is thus not “based on a permissible construction of\nthe statute.” Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural\nResources Defense Council , Inc., 467 U. S. 837 , 843.\nPp. 12–21. (a) While the meaning\nof “navigable waters” in the CWA is broader than the traditional\ndefinition found in The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, see Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps\nof Engineers, 531 U. S. 159 , 167 (SWANCC);\nUnited States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121 , 133, the CWA authorizes\nfederal jurisdiction only over “waters.” The use of the definite\narticle “the” and the plural number “waters” show plainly that\n§1362(7) does not refer to water in general, but more narrowly to\nwater “[a]s found in streams,” “oceans, rivers, [and] lakes,”\nWebster’s New International Dictionary 2882 (2d ed.). Those terms\nall connote relatively permanent bodies of water, as opposed to\nordinarily dry channels through which water occasionally or\nintermittently flows. Pp. 12–15. (b) The Act’s use of\nthe traditional phrase “navigable waters” further confirms that the\nCWA confers jurisdiction only over relatively permanent bodies of\nwater. Traditionally, such “waters” included only discrete bodies\nof water, and the term still carries some of its original\nsubstance, SWANCC, supra, at 172. This Court’s subsequent\ninterpretation of “the waters of the United States” in the CWA\nlikewise confirms this limitation. See, e.g., Riverside\nBayview, supra, at 131. And the CWA itself categorizes the\nchannels and conduits that typically carry intermittent flows of\nwater separately from “navigable waters,” including them in the\ndefinition of “ ‘point sources,’ ” 33 U. S. C.\n§1362(14). Moreover, only the foregoing definition of “waters” is\nconsistent with CWA’s stated policy “to recognize, preserve, and\nprotect the primary responsibilities and rights of the States … to\nplan the development and use … of land and water resources\n… .” §1251(b). In addition, “the waters of the United States”\nhardly qualifies as the clear and manifest statement from Congress\nneeded to authorize intrusion into such an area of traditional\nstate authority as land-use regulation; and to authorize federal\naction that stretches the limits of Congress’s commerce power. See SWANCC, supra, at 173. Pp. 15–21. 2. A wetland may not be considered\n“adjacent to” remote “waters of the United States” based on a mere\nhydrologic connection. Riverside Bayview rested on an\ninherent ambiguity in defining where the “water” ends and its\nabutting (“adjacent”) wetlands begin, permitting the Corps to rely\non ecological considerations only to resolve that ambiguity in\nfavor of treating all abutting wetlands as waters. Isolated ponds\nare not “waters of the United States” in their own right, see SWANCC, supra, at 167, 171, and present no\nboundary-drawing problem justifying the invocation of such\necological factors. Thus, only those wetlands with a continuous\nsurface connection to bodies that are “waters of the United States”\nin their own right, so that there is no clear demarcation between\nthe two, are “adjacent” to such waters and covered by the Act.\nEstablishing coverage of the Rapanos and Carabell sites requires\nfinding that the adjacent channel contains a relatively permanent\n“wate[r] of the United States,” and that each wetland has a\ncontinuous surface connection to that water, making it difficult to\ndetermine where the water ends and the wetland begins.\nPp. 21–24. 3. Because the Sixth Circuit applied an\nincorrect standard to determine whether the wetlands at issue are\ncovered “waters,” and because of the paucity of the record, the\ncases are remanded for further proceedings.\nP. 39. Justice Kennedy concluded that the Sixth\nCircuit correctly recognized that a water or wetland constitutes\n“navigable waters” under the Act if it possesses a “significant\nnexus” to waters that are navigable in fact or that could\nreasonably be so made, Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook\nCty. v. Army Corps of Engineers, 531 U. S. 159 , 167, 172 (SWANCC), but did not consider all the factors necessary\nto determine that the lands in question had, or did not have, the\nrequisite nexus. United States v. Riverside Bayview\nHomes, Inc., 474 U. S. 121 , and SWANCC establish the framework for the inquiry here. The nexus required\nmust be assessed in terms of the Act’s goals and purposes. Congress\nenacted the law to “restore and maintain the chemical, physical,\nand biological integrity of the Nation’s waters,” 33 U. S. C.\n§1251(a), and it pursued that objective by restricting dumping and\nfilling in “waters of the United States,” §§1311(a), 1362(12). The\nrationale for the Act’s wetlands regulation, as the Corps has\nrecognized, is that wetlands can perform critical functions related\nto the integrity of other waters—such as pollutant trapping, flood\ncontrol, and runoff storage. 33 C. F. R. §320.4(b)(2).\nAccordingly, wetlands possess the requisite nexus, and thus come\nwithin the statutory phrase “navigable waters,” if the wetlands,\nalone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the\nregion, significantly affect the chemical, physical, and biological\nintegrity of other covered waters understood as navigable in the\ntraditional sense. When, in contrast, their effects on water\nquality are speculative or insubstantial, they fall outside the\nzone fairly encompassed by the term “navigable waters.” Because the\nCorps’ theory of jurisdiction in these cases—adjacency to\ntributaries, however remote and insubstantial—goes beyond the Riverside Bayview holding, its assertion of jurisdiction\ncannot rest on that case. The breadth of the Corps’ existing\nstandard for tributaries—which seems to leave room for regulating\ndrains, ditches, and streams remote from any navigable-in-fact\nwater and carrying only minor water-volumes toward it—precludes\nthat standard’s adoption as the determinative measure of whether\nadjacent wetlands are likely to play an important role in the\nintegrity of an aquatic system comprising navigable waters as\ntraditionally understood. Absent more specific regulations, the\nCorps must establish a significant nexus on a case-by-case basis\nwhen seeking to regulate wetlands based on adjacency to\nnonnavigable tributaries, in order to avoid unreasonable\napplications of the Act. In the instant cases the record contains\nevidence pointing to a possible significant nexus, but neither the\nagency nor the reviewing courts considered the issue in these\nterms. Thus, the cases should be remanded for further proceedings.\nPp. 1–30. Scalia, J., announced the\njudgment of the Court, and delivered an opinion, in which Roberts,\nC. J., and Thomas and Alito, JJ., joined. Roberts, C. J.,\nfiled a concurring opinion.

S. ____ (2006) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NOS. 04-1034 AND 04-1384 JOHN A. RAPANOS, et ux., et al.,\nPETITIONERS 04–1034 v. UNITED STATES JUNE CARABELL et al., PETITIONERS 04–1384 v. UNITED STATES ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS\net al. on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit [June 19, 2006] Justice Scalia announced\nthe judgment of the Court, and delivered an opinion, in which The\nChief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito join. In April 1989, petitioner John A.\nRapanos backfilled wetlands on a parcel of land in Michigan that he\nowned and sought to develop. This parcel included 54 acres of land\nwith sometimes-saturated soil conditions. The nearest body of\nnavigable water was 11 to 20 miles away. 339 F. 3d 447, 449\n(CA6 2003) (Rapanos I) . Regulators had informed Mr.\nRapanos that his saturated fields were “waters of the United\nStates,” 33 U. S. C. §1362(7), that could not be filled\nwithout a permit. Twelve years of criminal and civil litigation\nensued. The burden of federal regulation on those who\nwould deposit fill material in locations denominated “waters of the\nUnited States” is not trivial. In deciding whether to grant or deny\na permit, the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) exercises the\ndiscretion of an enlightened despot, relying on such factors as\n“economics,” “aesthetics,” “recreation,” and “in general, the needs\nand welfare of the people,” 33 CFR §320.4(a) (2004).[ Footnote 1 ] The average applicant for an\nindividual permit spends 788 days and $271,596 in completing the\nprocess, and the average applicant for a nationwide permit spends\n313 days and $28,915—not counting costs of mitigation or design\nchanges. Sunding & Zilberman, The Economics of Environmental\nRegulation by Licensing: An Assessment of Recent Changes to the\nWetland Permitting Process, 42 Natural Resources J. 59, 74–76\n(2002). “[O]ver $1.7 billion is spent each year by the private and\npublic sectors obtaining wetlands permits.” Id. , at 81.\nThese costs cannot be avoided, because the Clean Water Act\n“impose[s] criminal liability,” as well as steep civil fines, “on a\nbroad range of ordinary industrial and commercial activities.” Hanousek v. United States , 528 U. S. 1102 , 1103\n(2000) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). In this\nlitigation, for example, for backfilling his own wet fields, Mr.\nRapanos faced 63 months in prison and hundreds of thousands of\ndollars in criminal and civil fines. See United States v. Rapanos, 235 F. 3d 256, 260 (CA6 2000). The enforcement proceedings against Mr.\nRapanos are a small part of the immense expansion of federal\nregulation of land use that has occurred under the Clean Water\nAct—without any change in the governing statute—during the past\nfive Presidential administrations. In the last three decades, the\nCorps and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have\ninterpreted their jurisdiction over “the waters of the United\nStates” to cover 270-to-300 million acres of swampy lands in the\nUnited States—including half of Alaska and an area the size of\nCalifornia in the lower 48 States. And that was just the beginning.\nThe Corps has also asserted jurisdiction over virtually any parcel\nof land containing a channel or conduit—whether man-made or\nnatural, broad or narrow, permanent or ephemeral—through which\nrainwater or drainage may occasionally or intermittently flow. On\nthis view, the federally regulated “waters of the United States”\ninclude storm drains, roadside ditches, ripples of sand in the\ndesert that may contain water once a year, and lands that are\ncovered by floodwaters once every 100 years. Because they include\nthe land containing storm sewers and desert washes, the statutory\n“waters of the United States” engulf entire cities and immense arid\nwastelands. In fact, the entire land area of the United States lies\nin some drainage basin, and an endless network of visible channels\nfurrows the entire surface, containing water ephemerally wherever\nthe rain falls. Any plot of land containing such a channel may\npotentially be regulated as a “water of the United States.” I Congress passed the Clean Water\nAct (CWA or Act) in 1972. The Act’s stated objective is “to restore\nand maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of\nthe Nation’s waters.” 86 Stat. 816, 33 U. S. C. §1251(a). The\nAct also states that “[i]t is the policy of Congress to recognize,\npreserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of\nStates to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution, to plan the\ndevelopment and use (including restoration, preservation, and\nenhancement) of land and water resources, and to consult with the\nAdministrator in the exercise of his authority under this chapter.”\n§1251(b). One of the statute’s principal\nprovisions is 33 U. S. C. §1311(a), which provides that “the\ndischarge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful.” “The\ndischarge of a pollutant” is defined broadly to include “any\naddition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point\nsource,” §1362(12), and “pollutant” is defined broadly to include\nnot only traditional contaminants but also solids such as “dredged\nspoil, . . . rock, sand, [and] cellar dirt,” §1362(6). And,\nmost relevant here, the CWA defines “navigable waters” as “the\nwaters of the United States, including the territorial seas.”\n§1362(7). The Act also provides certain exceptions to\nits prohibition of “the discharge of any pollutant by any person.”\n§1311(a). Section 1342(a) authorizes the Administrator of the EPA\nto “issue a permit for the discharge of any pollutant, …\nnotwithstanding section 1311(a) of this title.” Section 1344\nauthorizes the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Corps, to\n“issue permits … for the discharge of dredged or fill material into\nthe navigable waters at specified disposal sites.” §1344(a), (d).\nIt is the discharge of “dredged or fill material”—which, unlike\ntraditional water pollutants, are solids that do not readily wash\ndownstream—that we consider today. For a century prior to the CWA, we had\ninterpreted the phrase “navigable waters of the United States” in\nthe Act’s predecessor statutes to refer to interstate waters that\nare “navigable in fact” or readily susceptible of being rendered\nso. The Daniel Ball , 10 Wall. 557, 563 (1871); see also United States v. Appalachian Elec. Power Co. , 311 U. S. 377 ,\n406 (1940). After passage of the CWA, the Corps initially adopted\nthis traditional judicial definition for the Act’s term “navigable\nwaters.” See 39 Fed. Reg. 12119, codified at 33 CFR §209.120(d)(1)\n(1974); see also Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty. v. Army Corps of Engineers , 531 U. S. 159 , 168 (2001) (SWANCC). After a District Court enjoined these\nregulations as too narrow, Natural Resources Defense Council,\nInc. v. Callaway , 392 F. Supp. 685, 686 (DC\n1975), the Corps adopted a far broader definition. See 40 Fed. Reg.\n31324–31325 (1975); 42 Fed. Reg. 37144 (1977). The Corps’ new\nregulations deliberately sought to extend the definition of “the\nwaters of the United States” to the outer limits of Congress’s\ncommerce power. See id., at 37144, n. 2. The Corps’ current regulations interpret “the\nwaters of the United States” to include, in addition to traditional\ninterstate navigable waters, 33 CFR §328.3(a)(1) (2004), “[a]ll\ninterstate waters including interstate wetlands,” §328.3(a)(2);\n“[a]ll other waters such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams\n(including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands,\nsloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural\nponds, the use, degradation or destruction of which could affect\ninterstate or foreign commerce,” §328.3(a)(3); “[t]ributaries of\n[such] waters,” §328.3(a)(5); and “[w]etlands adjacent to [such]\nwaters [and tributaries] (other than waters that are themselves\nwetlands),” §328.3(a)(7). The regulation defines “adjacent”\nwetlands as those “bordering, contiguous [to], or neighboring”\nwaters of the United States. §328.3(c). It specifically provides\nthat “[w]etlands separated from other waters of the United States\nby man-made dikes or barriers, natural river berms, beach dunes and\nthe like are ‘adjacent wetlands.’ ” Ibid. We first addressed the proper interpretation\nof 33 U. S. C. §1362(7)’s phrase “the waters of the United\nStates” in United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes,\nInc. , 474 U. S.\n121 (1985). That case concerned a wetland that “was adjacent to\na body of navigable water,” because “the area characterized by\nsaturated soil conditions and wetland vegetation extended beyond\nthe boundary of respondent’s property to … a navigable waterway.” Id. , at 131; see also 33 CFR §328.3(b) (2004). Noting that\n“the transition from water to solid ground is not necessarily or\neven typically an abrupt one,” and that “the Corps must necessarily\nchoose some point at which water ends and land begins,” 474 U. S.,\nat 132, we upheld the Corps’ interpretation of “the waters of the\nUnited States” to include wetlands that “actually abut[ted] on”\ntraditional navigable waters. Id., at 135. Following our decision in Riverside\nBayview , the Corps adopted increasingly broad interpretations\nof its own regulations under the Act. For example, in 1986, to\n“clarify” the reach of its jurisdiction, the Corps announced the\nso-called “Migratory Bird Rule,” which purported to extend its\njurisdiction to any intrastate waters “[w]hich are or would be used\nas habitat” by migratory birds. 51 Fed. Reg. 41217; see also SWANCC , supra, at 163–164. In addition, the Corps\ninterpreted its own regulations to include “ephemeral streams” and\n“drainage ditches” as “tributaries” that are part of the “waters of\nthe United States,” see 33 CFR §328.3(a)(5), provided that they\nhave a perceptible “ordinary high water mark” as defined in\n§328.3(e). 65 Fed. Reg. 12823 (2000). This interpretation extended\n“the waters of the United States” to virtually any land feature\nover which rainwater or drainage passes and leaves a visible\nmark—even if only “the presence of litter and debris.” 33 CFR\n§328.3(e). See also U. S. General Accounting Office, Report to the\nChairman, Subcommittee on Energy Policy, Natural Resources and\nRegulating Affairs, Committee on Government Reform, House of\nRepresentatives, Waters and Wetlands: Corps of Engineers Needs to\nEvaluate Its District Office Practices in Determining Juris-\ndiction, GAO–04–297, pp. 20–22 (Feb. 2004) (hereinafter GAO\nReport), http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04297.pdf (all Internet\nmaterials as visited June 9, 2006, and available in Clerk of\nCourt’s case file). Prior to our decision in SWANCC , lower\ncourts upheld the application of this expansive definition of\n“tributaries” to such entities as storm sewers that contained flow\nto covered waters during heavy rainfall, United States v. Eidson , 108 F. 3d 1336, 1340–1342 (CA11 1997), and\ndry arroyos connected to remote waters through the flow of\ngroundwater over “centuries,” Quivira Mining Co. v. EPA , 765 F. 2d 126, 129 (CA10 1985). In SWANCC , we considered the\napplication of the Corps’ “Migratory Bird Rule” to “an abandoned\nsand and gravel pit in northern Illinois.” 531 U. S., at 162.\nObserving that “[i]t was the significant nexus between the\nwetlands and ‘navigable waters’ that informed our reading of the\nCWA in Riverside Bayview ,” id., at 167 (emphasis\nadded), we held that Riverside Bayview did not establish\n“that the jurisdiction of the Corps extends to ponds that are not\nadjacent to open water.” 531 U. S., at 168 (emphasis deleted). On\nthe contrary, we held that “nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate\nwaters,” id. , at 171—which, unlike the wetlands at issue\nin Riverside Bayview , did not “actually abu[t] on a\nnavigable waterway,” 531 U. S., at 167—were not included as “waters\nof the United States.” Following our decision in SWANCC , the\nCorps did not significantly revise its theory of federal\njurisdiction under §1344(a). The Corps provided notice of a\nproposed rulemaking in light of SWANCC , 68 Fed. Reg. 1991\n(2003), but ultimately did not amend its published regulations.\nBecause SWANCC did not directly address tributaries, the\nCorps notified its field staff that they “should continue to assert\njurisdiction over traditional navigable waters … and, generally\nspeaking, their tributary systems (and adjacent wetlands).” 68 Fed.\nReg. 1998. In addition, because SWANCC did not overrule Riverside Bayview , the Corps continues to assert\njurisdiction over waters “ ‘neighboring’ ” traditional\nnavigable waters and their tributaries. 68 Fed. Reg. 1997 (quoting\n33 CFR §328.3(c) (2003)). Even after SWANCC , the lower courts\nhave continued to uphold the Corps’ sweeping assertions of\njurisdiction over ephemeral channels and drains as “tributaries.”\nFor example, courts have held that jurisdictional “tributaries”\ninclude the “intermittent flow of surface water through\napproximately 2.4 miles of natural streams and manmade ditches\n(paralleling and crossing under I–64),” Treacy v. Newdunn Assoc. , 344 F. 3d 407, 410 (CA4 2003); a\n“roadside ditch” whose water took “a winding, thirty-two-mile path\nto the Chesapeake Bay,” United States v. Deaton ,\n332 F. 3d 698, 702 (CA4 2003); irrigation ditches and drains\nthat intermittently connect to covered waters, Community Assn.\nfor Restoration of Environment v. Henry Bosma Dairy ,\n305 F. 3d 943, 954–955 (CA9 2002); Headwaters, Inc. v. Talent Irrigation Dist. , 243 F. 3d 526, 534 (CA9\n2001); and (most implausibly of all) the “washes and arroyos” of an\n“arid development site,” located in the middle of the desert,\nthrough which “water courses . . . during periods of heavy\nrain,” Save Our Sonoran, Inc. v. Flowers , 408\nF. 3d 1113, 1118 (CA9 2005).[ Footnote 2 ] These judicial constructions of “tributaries”\nare not outliers. Rather, they reflect the breadth of the Corps’\ndeterminations in the field. The Corps’ enforcement practices vary\nsomewhat from district to district because “the definitions used to\nmake jurisdictional determinations” are deliberately left “vague.”\nGAO Report 26; see also id. , at 22. But district offices\nof the Corps have treated, as “waters of the United States,” such\ntypically dry land features as “arroyos, coulees, and washes,” as\nwell as other “channels that might have little water flow in a\ngiven year.” Id., at 20–21. They have also applied that\ndefinition to such manmade, intermittently flowing features as\n“drain tiles, storm drains systems, and culverts.” Id., at\n24 (footnote omitted). In addition to “tributaries,” the Corps and\nthe lower courts have also continued to define “adjacent” wetlands\nbroadly after SWANCC . For example, some of the Corps’\ndistrict offices have concluded that wetlands are “adjacent” to\ncovered waters if they are hydrologically connected “through\ndirectional sheet flow during storm events,” GAO Report 18, or if\nthey lie within the “100-year floodplain” of a body of water—that\nis, they are connected to the navigable water by flooding, on\naverage, once every 100 years, id., at 17, and n. 16.\nOthers have concluded that presence within 200 feet of a tributary\nautomatically renders a wetland “adjacent” and jurisdictional. Id., at 19. And the Corps has successfully defended such\ntheories of “adjacency” in the courts, even after SWANCC ’s\nexcision of “isolated” waters and wetlands from the Act’s coverage.\nOne court has held since SWANCC that wetlands separated\nfrom flood control channels by 70-foot-wide berms, atop which ran\nmaintenance roads, had a “significant nexus” to covered waters\nbecause, inter alia , they lay “within the 100 year\nfloodplain of tidal waters.” Baccarat Fremont Developers,\nLLC v. Army Corps of Engineers , 425 F. 3d 1150, 1152,\n1157 (CA9 2005). In one of the cases before us today, the Sixth\nCircuit held, in agreement with “[t]he majority of courts,” that\n“while a hydrological connection between the non-navigable and\nnavigable waters is required, there is no ‘direct abutment’\nrequirement” under SWANCC for “ ‘adjacency.’ ”\n376 F. 3d 629, 639 (2004) (Rapanos II) . And even the\nmost insubstantial hydrologic connection may be held to constitute\na “significant nexus.” One court distinguished SWANCC on\nthe ground that “a molecule of water residing in one of these pits\nor ponds [in SWANCC ] could not mix with molecules from\nother bodies of water”—whereas, in the case before it, “water\nmolecules currently present in the wetlands will inevitably flow\ntowards and mix with water from connecting bodies,” and “[a] drop\nof rainwater landing in the Site is certain to intermingle with\nwater from the [nearby river].” United States v. Rueth\nDevelopment Co. , 189 F. Supp. 2d 874, 877–878 (ND Ind.\n2002). II In these consolidated cases, we\nconsider whether four Michigan wetlands, which lie near ditches or\nman-made drains that eventually empty into traditional navigable\nwaters, constitute “waters of the United States” within the meaning\nof the Act. Petitioners in No. 04–1034, the Rapanos and their\naffiliated businesses, deposited fill material without a permit\ninto wetlands on three sites near Midland, Michigan: the “Salzburg\nsite,” the “Hines Road site,” and the “Pine River site.” The\nwetlands at the Salzburg site are connected to a man-made drain,\nwhich drains into Hoppler Creek, which flows into the Kawkawlin\nRiver, which empties into Saginaw Bay and Lake Huron. See Brief for\nUnited States in No. 04–1034, p. 11; 339 F. 3d, at 449.\nThe wetlands at the Hines Road site are connected to something\ncalled the “Rose Drain,” which has a surface connection to the\nTittabawassee River. App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 04–1034, pp.\nA23, B20. And the wetlands at the Pine River site have a surface\nconnection to the Pine River, which flows into Lake Huron. Id. , at A23–A24, B26. It is not clear whether the\nconnections between these wetlands and the nearby drains and\nditches are continuous or intermittent, or whether the nearby\ndrains and ditches contain continuous or merely occasional flows of\nwater. The United States brought civil\nenforcement proceedings against the Rapanos petitioners. The\nDistrict Court found that the three described wetlands were “within\nfederal jurisdiction” because they were “adjacent to other waters\nof the United States,” and held petitioners liable for violations\nof the CWA at those sites. Id., at B32–B35. On appeal, the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed,\nholding that there was federal jurisdiction over the wetlands at\nall three sites because “there were hydrological connections\nbetween all three sites and corresponding adjacent tributaries of\nnavigable waters.” 376 F. 3d, at 643. Petitioners in No. 04–1384, the Carabells,\nwere denied a permit to deposit fill material in a wetland located\non a triangular parcel of land about one mile from Lake St. Clair.\nA man-made drainage ditch runs along one side of the wetland,\nseparated from it by a 4-foot-wide man-made berm. The berm is\nlargely or entirely impermeable to water and blocks drainage from\nthe wetland, though it may permit occasional overflow to the ditch.\nThe ditch empties into another ditch or a drain, which connects to\nAuvase Creek, which empties into Lake St. Clair. See App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. in No. 04–1384, pp. 2a–3a. After exhausting administrative appeals, the\nCarabell petitioners filed suit in the District Court, challenging\nthe exercise of federal regulatory jurisdiction over their site.\nThe District Court ruled that there was federal jurisdiction\nbecause the wetland “is adjacent to neighboring tributaries of\nnavigable waters and has a significant nexus to ‘waters of the\nUnited States.’ ” Id. , at 49a. Again the Sixth\nCircuit affirmed, holding that the Carabell wetland was “adjacent”\nto navigable waters. 391 F. 3d 704, 708 (2004) (Carabell). We granted certiorari and consolidated the\ncases, 546 U. S. ___ (2005), to decide whether these wetlands\nconstitute “waters of the United States” under the Act, and if so,\nwhether the Act is constitutional. III The Rapanos petitioners contend\nthat the terms “navigable waters” and “waters of the United States”\nin the Act must be limited to the traditional definition of The\nDaniel Ball , which required that the “waters” be navigable in\nfact, or susceptible of being rendered so. See 10 Wall., at 563.\nBut this definition cannot be applied wholesale to the CWA. The Act\nuses the phrase “navigable waters” as a defined term, and\nthe definition is simply “the waters of the United States.” 33 U.\nS. C. §1362(7). Moreover, the Act provides, in certain\ncircumstances, for the substitution of state for federal\njurisdiction over “navigable waters … other than those\nwaters which are presently used, or are susceptible to use in their\nnatural condition or by reasonable improvement as a means to\ntransport interstate or foreign commerce … including wetlands\nadjacent thereto.” §1344(g)(1) (emphasis added). This provision\nshows that the Act’s term “navigable waters” includes something\nmore than traditional navigable waters. We have twice stated that\nthe meaning of “navigable waters” in the Act is broader than the\ntraditional understanding of that term, SWANCC , 531 U. S.,\nat 167; Riverside Bayview , 474 U. S., at 133.[ Footnote 3 ] We have also emphasized,\nhowever, that the qualifier “navigable” is not devoid of\nsignificance, SWANCC , supra, at 172. We need not decide the precise\nextent to which the qualifiers “navigable” and “of the United\nStates” restrict the coverage of the Act. Whatever the scope of\nthese qualifiers, the CWA authorizes federal jurisdiction only over\n“waters.” 33 U. S. C. §1362(7). The only natural definition of\nthe term “waters,” our prior and subsequent judicial constructions\nof it, clear evidence from other provisions of the statute, and\nthis Court’s canons of construction all confirm that “the waters of\nthe United States” in §1362(7) cannot bear the expansive meaning\nthat the Corps would give it. The Corps’ expansive approach might be\narguable if the CSA defined “navigable waters” as “water of the\nUnited States.” But “the waters of the United States” is something\nelse. The use of the definite article (“the”) and the plural number\n(“waters”) show plainly that §1362(7) does not refer to water in\ngeneral. In this form, “the waters” refers more narrowly to water\n“[a]s found in streams and bodies forming geographical features\nsuch as oceans, rivers, [and] lakes,” or “the flowing or moving\nmasses, as of waves or floods, making up such streams or bodies.”\nWebster’s New International Dictionary 2882 (2d ed. 1954)\n(hereinafter Webster’s Second).[ Footnote 4 ] On this definition, “the waters of the United\nStates” include only relatively permanent, standing or flowing\nbodies of water.[ Footnote 5 ]\nThe definition refers to water as found in “streams,” “oceans,”\n“rivers,” “lakes,” and “bodies” of water “forming geographical\nfeatures.” Ibid",

TYSON FOODS,\nINC. on petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the eleventh circuit No. 05–379. Decided February 21, 2006 Per Curiam. Petitioners Anthony Ash and John\nHithon were superintendents at a poultry plant owned and operated\nby respondent Tyson Foods, Inc. Petitioners, who are\nAfrican-American, sought promotions to fill two open shift manager\npositions, but two white males were selected instead. Alleging that\nTyson had discriminated on account of race, petitioners sued under\nRev. Stat. §1977, 42 U. S. C. §1981, and Title VII of the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U.\nS. C. §2000e et seq . A trial proceeded in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Alabama. At the close\nof the plaintiffs’ evidence, Tyson moved for judgment as a matter\nof law, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 50(a). The District Court denied\nthe motion, and the jury found for petitioners, awarding\ncompensatory and punitive damages. The employer renewed its motion\nfor judgment under Rule 50(b). The District Court granted the\nmotion and, in the alternative, ordered a new trial as to both\nplaintiffs under Rule 50(c). App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a; see\ngenerally Unitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc. , 546 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op.,\nat 4–11) (discussing Rule 50). The United States Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. 129 Fed.\nAppx. 529, 536 (2005) (per curiam). As to Ash, the court\naffirmed the grant of the Rule 50(b) motion, deeming the trial\nevidence insufficient to show pretext (and thus insufficient to\nshow unlawful discrimination) under the burden-shifting framework\nset forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792 (1973). 129 Fed. Appx., at 533–534. As to Hithon, the court\nreversed the Rule 50(b) ruling, finding there was enough evidence\nto go to the jury. The court, however, affirmed the District\nCourt’s alternative remedy of a new trial under Rule 50(c), holding\nthat the evidence supported neither the decision to grant punitive\ndamages nor the amount of the compensatory award, and thus that the\nDistrict Court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a new\ntrial. Id. , at 536. The judgment of the Court of Appeals, and the\ntrial court rulings it affirmed, may be correct in the final\nanalysis. In the course of its opinion, however, the Court of\nAppeals erred in two respects, requiring that its judgment now be\nvacated and the case remanded for further consideration. First, there was evidence that Tyson’s plant\nmanager, who made the disputed hiring decisions, had referred on\nsome occasions to each of the petitioners as “boy.” Petitioners\nargued this was evidence of discriminatory animus. The Court of\nAppeals disagreed, holding that “[w]hile the use of ‘boy’ when\nmodified by a racial classification like ‘black’ or ‘white’ is\nevidence of discriminatory intent, the use of ‘boy’ alone is not\nevidence of discrimination.” Id., at 533 (citation\nomitted). Although it is true the disputed word will not always be\nevidence of racial animus, it does not follow that the term,\nstanding alone, is always benign. The speaker’s meaning may depend\non various factors including context, inflection, tone of voice,\nlocal custom, and historical usage. Insofar as the Court of Appeals\nheld that modifiers or qualifications are necessary in all\ninstances to render the disputed term probative of bias, the\ncourt’s decision is erroneous. Second, the Court of Appeals erred in\narticulating the standard for determining whether the asserted\nnondiscriminatory reasons for Tyson’s hiring decisions were\npretextual. Petitioners had introduced evidence that their\nqualifications were superior to those of the two successful\napplicants. (Part of the employer’s defense was that the plant with\nthe openings had performance problems and petitioners already\nworked there in a supervisory capacity.) The Court of Appeals, in\nfinding petitioners’ evidence insufficient, cited one of its\nearlier precedents and stated: “Pretext can be established through\ncomparing qualifications only when ‘the disparity in qualifications\nis so apparent as virtually to jump off the page and slap you in\nthe face.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Cooper v. Southern Co. , 390 F. 3d 695, 732 (CA11 2004)). Under this Court’s decisions, qualifications\nevidence may suffice, at least in some circumstances, to show\npretext. See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164 ,\n187–188 (1989) (indicating a plaintiff “might seek to demonstrate\nthat respondent’s claim to have promoted a better qualified\napplicant was pretextual by showing that she was in fact better\nqualified than the person chosen for the position”), superseded on\nother grounds by 42 U. S. C. §1981(b); Texas Dept. of\nCommunity Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U. S. 248 , 259\n(1981) (“The fact that a court may think that the employer\nmisjudged the qualifications of the applicants does not in itself\nexpose him to Title VII liability, although this may be probative\nof whether the employer’s reasons are pretexts for\ndiscrimination”); cf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing\nProducts, Inc., 530 U. S. 133 , 148\n(2000) (“[A] plaintiff’s prima facie case, combined with sufficient\nevidence to find that the employer’s asserted justification is\nfalse, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer\nunlawfully discriminated”). The visual image of words jumping off the page\nto slap you (presumably a court) in the face is unhelpful and\nimprecise as an elaboration of the standard for inferring pretext\nfrom superior qualifications. Federal courts, including the Court\nof Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in a decision it cited here,\nhave articulated various other standards, see, e.g., Cooper , supra, at 732 (noting that “disparities\nin qualifications must be of such weight and significance that no\nreasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could\nhave chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff for the job\nin question” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Raad v. Fairbanks North Star Borough School Dist. , 323 F. 3d\n1185, 1194 (CA9 2003) (holding that qualifications evidence\nstanding alone may establish pretext where the plaintiff’s\nqualifications are “ ‘clearly superior’ ” to those of the\nselected job applicant); Aka v. Washington Hospital\nCenter , 156 F. 3d 1284, 1294 (CADC 1998) (en banc)\n(concluding the factfinder may infer pretext if “a reasonable\nemployer would have found the plaintiff to be significantly better\nqualified for the job”), and in this case the Court of Appeals\nqualified its statement by suggesting that superior qualifications\nmay be probative of pretext when combined with other evidence, see\n129 Fed.

UNITED STATES certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the fourth circuit No. 06–6330. Argued October 2, 2007—Decided\nDecember 10, 2007 Under the statute criminalizing the manufacture and\ndistribution of cocaine, 21 U. S. C. §841, and the relevant\nFederal Sentencing Guidelines, a drug trafficker dealing in crack\ncocaine is subject to the same sentence as one dealing in 100 times\nmore powder cocaine. Petitioner Kimbrough pleaded guilty to four\noffenses: conspiracy to distribute crack and powder; possession\nwith intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack; possession\nwith intent to distribute powder; and possession of a firearm in\nfurtherance of a drug-trafficking offense. Under the relevant\nstatutes, Kimbrough’s plea subjected him to a minimum prison term\nof 15 years and a maximum of life. The applicable advisory\nGuidelines range was 228 to 270 months, or 19 to 22.5 years. The\nDistrict Court found, however, that a sentence in this range would\nhave been greater than necessary to accomplish the purposes of\nsentencing set forth in 18 U. S. C. §3553(a). In making that\ndetermination, the court relied in part on its view that\nKimbrough’s case exemplified the “disproportionate and unjust\neffect that crack cocaine guidelines have in sentencing.” The court\nnoted that if Kimbrough had possessed only powder cocaine, his\nGuidelines range would have been far lower: 97 to 106 months.\nConcluding that the statutory minimum sentence was long enough to\naccomplish §3553(a)’s objectives, the court sentenced Kimbrough to\n15 years, or 180 months, in prison. The Fourth Circuit vacated the\nsentence, finding that a sentence outside the Guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement\nwith the sentencing disparity for crack and powder offenses. Held: 1. Under United\nStates v. Booker , 543 U. S. 220 , the\ncocaine Guidelines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory only,\nand the Fourth Circuit erred in holding the crack/powder disparity\neffectively mandatory. A district judge must include the Guidelines\nrange in the array of factors warranting consideration, but the\njudge may determine that, in the particular case, a\nwithin-Guidelines sentence is “greater than necessary” to serve the\nobjectives of sentencing, §3553(a). In making that determination,\nthe judge may consider the disparity between the Guidelines’\ntreatment of crack and powder offenses. Pp. 5–21. (a) Crack and powder\ncocaine have the same physiological and psychotropic effects, but\nare handled very differently for sentencing purposes. The relevant\nstatutes and Guidelines employ a 100-to-1 ratio that yields\nsentences for crack offenses three to six times longer than those\nfor offenses involving equal amounts of powder. Thus, a major\nsupplier of powder may receive a shorter sentence than a low-level\ndealer who buys powder and converts it to crack. Pp. 5–11. (1) The\ncrack/powder disparity originated in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of\n1986 (1986 Act), which created a two-tiered scheme of five- and\nten-year mandatory minimum sentences for drug manufacturing and\ndistribution offenses. Congress apparently adopted the 100-to-1\nratio because it believed that crack, a relatively new drug in\n1986, was significantly more dangerous than powder. Thus, the 1986\nAct’s five-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant\naccountable for 5 grams of crack or 500 grams of powder, and its\nten-year mandatory minimum applies to any defendant accountable for\n50 grams of crack or 5,000 grams of powder. In developing\nGuidelines sentences for cocaine offenses, the Sentencing\nCommission employed the statute’s weight-driven scheme, rather than\nits usual empirical approach based on past sentencing practices.\nThe statute itself specifies only two quantities of each drug, but\nthe Guidelines used the 100-to-1 ratio to set sentences for a full\nrange of drug quantities. Pp. 6–8. (2) Based\non additional research and experience with the 100-to-1 ratio, the\nCommission later determined that the crack/powder differential does\nnot meet the objectives of the Sentencing Reform Act and the 1986\nAct. The Commission also found the disparity inconsistent with the\n1986 Act’s goal of punishing major drug traffickers more severely\nthan low-level dealers, and furthermore observed that the\ndifferential fosters a lack of confidence in the criminal justice\nsystem because of a perception that it promotes an unwarranted\ndivergence based on race. Pp. 8–10. (3) The\nCommission has several times sought to achieve a reduction in the\ncrack/powder ratio. Congress rejected a 1995 amendment to the\nGuidelines that would have replaced the 100-to-1 ratio with a\n1-to-1 ratio, but directed the Commission to propose revision of\nthe ratio under the relevant statutes and Guidelines. Congress took\nno action after the Commission’s 1997 and 2002 reports recommended\nchanging the ratio. The Commission’s 2007 report again urged\nCongress to amend the 1986 Act, but the Commission also adopted an\nameliorating change in the Guidelines. The modest amendment, which\nbecame effective on November 1, 2007, yields sentences for crack\noffenses between two and five times longer than sentences for equal\namounts of powder. The Commission thus noted that it is only a\npartial remedy to the problems generated by the crack/powder\ndisparity. Pp. 10–11. (b) The federal\nsentencing statute, as modified by Booker , requires a\ncourt to give respectful consideration to the Guidelines, but\n“permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other\n[§3553(a)] concerns as well,” 543 U. S., at 245–246. The\nGovernment contends that the Guidelines adopting the 100-to-1 ratio\nare an exception to this general freedom and offers three arguments\nin support of its position, each of which this Court rejects.\nPp. 11–21. (1) The\nGovernment argues that the 1986 Act itself prohibits the Commission\nand sentencing courts from disagreeing with the 100-to-1 ratio.\nThis position lacks grounding in the statute, which, by its terms,\nmandates only maximum and minimum sentences: A person convicted of\npossession with intent to distribute 5 grams or more of crack must\nbe sentenced to a minimum of 5 years and a maximum of 40. A person\nwith 50 grams or more of crack must be sentenced to a minimum of 10\nyears and a maximum of life. The statute says nothing about\nappropriate sentences within these brackets, and this Court\ndeclines to read any implicit directive into the congressional\nsilence. See Jama v. Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement , 543 U. S. 335 , 341.\nDrawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate here,\nbecause Congress knows how to direct sentencing practices in\nexpress terms. See, e.g., 28 U. S. C. §994(h). This\ncautious reading of the 1986 Act draws force from Neal v. United States , 516 U. S. 284 , which\ninvolved different methods of calculating lysergic acid\ndiethylamide (LSD) weights: The method applicable in determining\nstatutory minimum sentences combined the weight of the pure drug\nand its carrier medium, while the one controlling the calculation\nof Guidelines ranges presumed a lower weight for the carrier\nmedium. This Court rejected the argument that the Guidelines and\nthe statute should be interpreted consistently, with the\nGuidelines’ presumptive-weight method controlling the mandatory\nminimum calculation. Were the Government’s current position\ncorrect, the Guidelines involved in Neal would be in\nserious jeopardy. The same reasons alleged to justify reading into\nthe 1986 Act an implicit command to the Commission and sentencing\ncourts to apply the 100-to-1 ratio to all crack quantities could be\nurged in support of an argument that the 1986 Act requires the\nCommission to include the full weight of the carrier medium in\ncalculating LSD weights. Yet Neal never questioned the\nGuidelines’ validity, and in fact endorsed the Commission’s freedom\nto adopt a new method. If the 1986 Act does not require the\nCommission to adhere to the Act’s method for determining LSD\nweights, it does not require the Commission—or, after Booker , sentencing courts—to adhere to the 100-to-1 ratio\nfor crack quantities other than those triggering the statutory\nmandatory minimum sentences. Pp. 13–16. (2) The\nGovernment also argues that Congress made clear, in disapproving\nthe Commission’s 1995 proposed Guidelines amendment, that the 1986\nAct required the Commission and courts to respect the 100-to-1\nratio. But nothing in Congress’ 1995 action suggested that crack\nsentences must exceed powder sentences by a ratio of 100 to 1. To\nthe contrary, Congress required the Commission to recommend a\nrevision of the ratio. The Government argues that, by calling for\nrecommendations to change both the statute and the Guidelines,\nCongress meant to bar any Guidelines alteration in advance of\ncongressional action. But the more likely reading is that Congress\nsought proposals to amend both the statute and the Guidelines\nbecause the Commission’s criticisms of the 100-to-1 ratio concerned\nthe exorbitance of the crack/powder disparity in both contexts.\nMoreover, as a result of the 2007 amendment, which Congress did not\ndisapprove or modify, the Guidelines now deviate from the statute’s\n100-to-1 ratio, advancing a ratio that varies (at different offense\nlevels) between 25 to 1 and 80 to 1. Pp. 16–18. (3) Finally,\nthe Government argues that if district courts are free to deviate\nfrom the Guidelines based on disagreements with the crack/powder\nratio, “unwarranted sentence disparities,” 18 U. S. C.\n§3553(a)(6), will ensue. The Government claims that, because\nsentencing courts remain bound by the 1986 Act’s mandatory minimum\nsentences, deviations from the 100-to-1 ratio could result in\nsentencing “cliffs” around quantities triggering the mandatory\nminimums. For example, a district court could grant a sizable\ndownward variance to a defendant convicted of distributing 49 grams\nof crack, but would be required by the statutory minimum to impose\na much higher sentence for only 1 additional gram. The LSD\nGuidelines approved in Neal, however, create a similar\nrisk of sentencing “cliffs.” The Government also maintains that, if\ndistrict courts are permitted to vary from the Guidelines based on\ntheir disagreement with the crack/powder disparity, defendants will\nreceive markedly different sentences depending on the particular\njudge drawn for sentencing. While uniformity remains an important\nsentencing goal, Booker recognized that some departures\nfrom uniformity were a necessary cost of the remedy that decision\nadopted. And as to crack sentences in particular, possible\nvariations among district courts are constrained by the 1986 Act’s\nmandatory minimums. Moreover, to the extent that the Government\ncorrectly identifies risks of “unwarranted sentence disparities”\nwithin the meaning of §3353(a)(6), the proper solution is for\ndistrict courts to take account of sentencing practices in other\ncourts and the “cliffs” resulting from the statutory mandatory\nminimum sentences and weigh these disparities against the other\n§3553(a) factors and any unwarranted disparities created by the\ncrack/powder ratio itself. Pp. 18–20. (c) Booker rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, 543 U. S., at 245, but\npreserved a key role for the Sentencing Commission. In the ordinary\ncase, the Commission’s recommendation of a sentencing range will\n“reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve\n§3553(a)’s objectives.” Rita v. United States ,\n551 U. S. ___, ___ (slip op., at 11). The sentencing judge, on the\nother hand, is “in a superior position to find facts and judge\ntheir import under §3553(a) in each particular case.” Gall v. United States , ante , at 13 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). In light of these discrete institutional strengths,\na district court’s decision to vary from the advisory Guidelines\nmay attract greatest respect when the sentencing judge finds a\nparticular case “outside the ‘heartland’ to which the Commission\nintends individual Guidelines to apply.” Rita , 551 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 12). On the other hand, while the Guidelines\nare no longer binding, closer review may be in order when the\nsentencing judge varies from the Guidelines based solely on the\njudge’s view that the Guidelines range “fails properly to reflect\n§3553(a) considerations” even in a mine-run case. Ibid. The crack cocaine Guidelines, however, present no occasion for\nelaborative discussion of this matter because those Guidelines do\nnot exemplify the Commission’s exercise of its characteristic\ninstitutional role. Given the Commission’s departure from its\nempirical approach in formulating the crack Guidelines and its\nsubsequent criticism of the crack/powder disparity, it would not be\nan abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when\nsentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity\nyields a sentence “greater than necessary” to achieve §3553(a)’s\npurposes, even in a mine-run case. Pp. 20–21. 2. The 180-month sentence imposed on\nKimbrough should survive appellate inspection. The District Court\nbegan by properly calculating and considering the advisory\nGuidelines range. It then addressed the relevant §3553(a) factors,\nincluding the Sentencing Commission’s reports criticizing the\n100-to-1 ratio. Finally, the court did not purport to establish a\nratio of its own, but appropriately framed its final determination\nin line with §3553(a)’s overarching instruction to “impose a\nsentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary” to accomplish\nthe sentencing goals advanced in §3553(a)(2). The court thus rested\nits sentence on the appropriate considerations and “committed no\nprocedural error,” Gall, ante , at 17. Kimbrough’s\nsentence was 4.5 years below the bottom of the Guidelines range.\nBut in determining that 15 years was the appropriate prison term,\nthe District Court properly homed in on the particular\ncircumstances of Kimbrough’s case and accorded weight to the\nSentencing Commission’s consistent and emphatic position that the\ncrack/powder disparity is at odds with §3553(a). Giving due respect\nto the District Court’s reasoned appraisal, a reviewing court could\nnot rationally conclude that the 4.5-year sentence reduction\nKimbrough received qualified as an abuse of discretion. Pp.\n21–23. 174 Fed. Appx. 798, reversed and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the\nopinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Stevens,\nScalia, Kennedy, Souter, and Breyer, JJ., joined.

S. ____ (2007) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 06-6330 DERRICK KIMBROUGH, PETITIONER v. UNITED\nSTATES on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit [December 10, 2007] Justice Ginsburg delivered the\nopinion of the Court. This Court’s remedial opinion in United States v. Booker , 543\nU. S. 220 , 244 (2005), instructed district courts to read the\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines as “effectively advisory,” id. , at 245. In accord with 18 U. S. C.\n§3553(a), the Guidelines, formerly mandatory, now serve as one\nfactor among several courts must consider in determining an\nappropriate sentence. Booker further instructed that\n“reasonableness” is the standard controlling appellate review of\nthe sentences district courts impose. Under the statute criminalizing the\nmanufacture and distribution of crack cocaine, 21 U. S. C.\n§841, and the relevant Guidelines prescription, §2D1.1, a drug\ntrafficker dealing in crack cocaine is subject to the same sentence\nas one dealing in 100 times more powder cocaine. The question here\npresented is whether, as the Court of Appeals held in this case, “a\nsentence … outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when\nit is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for\ncrack and powder cocaine offenses.” 174 Fed. Appx. 798, 799 (CA4\n2006) (per curiam) . We hold that, under Booker ,\nthe cocaine Guidelines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory\nonly, and that the Court of Appeals erred in holding the\ncrack/powder disparity effectively mandatory. A district judge must\ninclude the Guidelines range in the array of factors warranting\nconsideration. The judge may determine, however, that, in the\nparticular case, a within-Guidelines sentence is “greater than\nnecessary” to serve the objectives of sentencing. 18 U. S. C.\n§3553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. V). In making that determination, the\njudge may consider the disparity between the Guidelines’ treatment\nof crack and powder cocaine offenses. I In September 2004, petitioner\nDerrick Kimbrough was indicted in the United States District Court\nfor the Eastern District of Virginia and charged with four\noffenses: conspiracy to distribute crack and powder cocaine;\npossession with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack\ncocaine; possession with intent to distribute powder cocaine; and\npossession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking\noffense. Kimbrough pleaded guilty to all four charges. Under the relevant statutes,\nKimbrough’s plea subjected him to an aggregate sentence of 15 years\nto life in prison: 10 years to life for the three drug offenses,\nplus a consecutive term of 5 years to life for the firearm\noffense.[ Footnote 1 ] In order\nto determine the appropriate sentence within this statutory range,\nthe District Court first calculated Kimbrough’s sentence under the\nadvisory Sentencing Guidelines.[ Footnote 2 ] Kimbrough’s guilty plea acknowledged that he\nwas accountable for 56 grams of crack cocaine and 92.1 grams of\npowder cocaine. This quantity of drugs yielded a base offense level\nof 32 for the three drug charges. See United States Sentencing\nCommission, Guidelines Manual §2D1.1(c) (Nov. 2004) (USSG). Finding\nthat Kimbrough, by asserting sole culpability for the crime, had\ntestified falsely at his codefendant’s trial, the District Court\nincreased his offense level to 34. See §3C1.1. In accord with the\npresentence report, the court determined that Kimbrough’s criminal\nhistory category was II. An offense level of 34 and a criminal\nhistory category of II yielded a Guidelines range of 168 to 210\nmonths for the three drug charges. See id. , ch. 5,\npt. A, Sentencing Table. The Guidelines sentence for the\nfirearm offense was the statutory minimum, 60 months. See\nUSSG §2K2.4(b). Kimbrough’s final advisory Guidelines range\nwas thus 228 to 270 months, or 19 to 22.5 years. A sentence in this range, in the District\nCourt’s judgment, would have been “greater than necessary” to\naccomplish the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U. S. C.\n§3553(a). App. 72. As required by §3553(a), the court took\ninto account the “nature and circumstances” of the offense and\nKimbrough’s “history and characteristics.” Id. ,\nat 72–73. The court also commented that the case exemplified\nthe “disproportionate and unjust effect that crack cocaine\nguidelines have in sentencing.” Id. , at 72. In this\nregard, the court contrasted Kimbrough’s Guidelines range of 228 to\n270 months with the range that would have applied had he been\naccountable for an equivalent amount of powder cocaine: 97 to 106\nmonths, inclusive of the 5-year mandatory minimum for the firearm\ncharge, see USSG §2D1.1(c); id. , ch. 5, pt. A,\nSentencing Table. Concluding that the statutory minimum sentence\nwas “clearly long enough” to accomplish the objectives listed in\n§3553(a), the court sentenced Kimbrough to 15 years, or 180 months,\nin prison plus 5 years of supervised release.\nApp. 74–75.[ Footnote\n3 ] In an unpublished per curiam opinion,\nthe Fourth Circuit vacated the sentence. Under Circuit precedent,\nthe Court of Appeals observed, a sentence “outside the guidelines\nrange is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement\nwith the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine\noffenses.” 174 Fed. Appx., at 799 (citing United States v. Eura , 440 F. 3d 625, 633–634 (CA4 2006)). We granted certiorari, 551 U. S. ___ (2007),\nto determine whether the crack/powder disparity adopted in the\nUnited States Sentencing Guidelines has been rendered “advisory” by\nour decision in Booker .[ Footnote 4 ] II We begin with some background on\nthe different treatment of crack and powder cocaine under the\nfederal sentencing laws. Crack and powder cocaine are two forms of\nthe same drug. Powder cocaine, or cocaine hydrochloride, is\ngenerally inhaled through the nose; it may also be mixed with water\nand injected. See United States Sentencing Commission, Special\nReport to Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 5, 12\n(Feb. 1995), available at http://www.ussc.gov/crack/exec.htm\n(hereinafter 1995 Report). (All Internet materials as visited Dec.\n7, 2007, and included in Clerk of Court’s case file.) Crack\ncocaine, a type of cocaine base, is formed by dissolving powder\ncocaine and baking soda in boiling water. Id. , at 14.\nThe resulting solid is divided into single-dose “rocks” that users\nsmoke. Ibid. The active ingredient in powder and crack\ncocaine is the same. Id. , at 9. The two forms of the\ndrug also have the same physiological and psychotropic effects, but\nsmoking crack cocaine allows the body to absorb the drug much\nfaster than inhaling powder cocaine, and thus produces a shorter,\nmore intense high. Id. , at 15–19.[ Footnote 5 ] Although chemically similar,\ncrack and powder cocaine are handled very differently for\nsentencing purposes. The 100&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 ratio\nyields sentences for crack offenses three to six times longer than\nthose for powder offenses involving equal amounts of drugs. See\nUnited States Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Cocaine\nand Federal Sentencing Policy iv (May 2002), available at\nhttp://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/02crack/ 2002crackrpt.pdf\n(hereinafter 2002 Report).[ Footnote\n6 ] This disparity means that a major supplier of powder cocaine\nmay receive a shorter sentence than a low-level dealer who buys\npowder from the supplier but then converts it to crack. See 1995\nReport 193–194. A The crack/powder disparity\noriginated in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (1986 Act), 100 Stat.\n3207. The 1986 Act created a two-tiered scheme of five- and\nten-year mandatory minimum sentences for drug manufacturing and\ndistribution offenses. Congress sought “to link the ten-year\nmandatory minimum trafficking prison term to major drug dealers and\nto link the five-year minimum term to serious traffickers.” 1995\nReport 119. The 1986 Act uses the weight of the drugs involved\nin the offense as the sole proxy to identify “major” and “serious”\ndealers. For example, any defendant responsible for 100 grams of\nheroin is subject to the five-year mandatory minimum, see 21 U.\nS. C. §841(b)(1)(B)(i) (2000 ed. and Supp V), and any\ndefendant responsible for 1,000 grams of heroin is subject to the\nten-year mandatory minimum, see §841(b)(1)(A)(i). Crack cocaine was a relatively\nnew drug when the 1986 Act was signed into law, but it was already\na matter of great public concern: “Drug abuse in general, and crack\ncocaine in particular, had become in public opinion and in members’\nminds a problem of overwhelming dimensions.” 1995 Report 121.\nCongress apparently believed that crack was significantly more\ndangerous than powder cocaine in that: (1) crack was highly\naddictive; (2) crack users and dealers were more likely to be\nviolent than users and dealers of other drugs; (3) crack was more\nharmful to users than powder, particularly for children who had\nbeen exposed by their mothers’ drug use during pregnancy; (4) crack\nuse was especially prevalent among teenagers; and (5) crack’s\npotency and low cost were making it increasingly popular. See 2002\nReport 90. Based on these assumptions, the 1986 Act\nadopted a “100&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 ratio” that treated every\ngram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of 100 grams of powder\ncocaine. The Act’s five-year mandatory minimum applies to any\ndefendant accountable for 5 grams of crack or 500 grams of powder,\n21 U. S. C. §841(b)(1)(B)(ii), (iii); its ten-year mandatory\nminimum applies to any defendant accountable for 50 grams of crack\nor 5,000 grams of powder, §841(b)(1)(A)(ii), (iii). While Congress was considering adoption of the\n1986 Act, the Sentencing Commission was engaged in formulating the\nSentencing Guidelines.[ Footnote\n7 ] In the main, the Commission developed Guidelines sentences\nusing an empirical approach based on data about past sentencing\npractices, including 10,000 presentence investigation reports. See\nUSSG §1A.1, intro. comment., pt. A, ¶3. The Commission\n“modif[ied] and adjust[ed] past practice in the interests of\ngreater rationality, avoiding inconsistency, complying with\ncongressional instructions, and the like.” Rita v. United States , 551 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op.,\nat 10). The Commission did not use this empirical\napproach in developing the Guidelines sentences for\ndrug-trafficking offenses. Instead, it employed the 1986 Act’s\nweight-driven scheme. The Guidelines use a drug quantity table\nbased on drug type and weight to set base offense levels for drug\ntrafficking offenses. See USSG §2D1.1(c). In setting offense levels\nfor crack and powder cocaine, the Commission, in line with the 1986\nAct, adopted the 100&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 ratio. The statute\nitself specifies only two quantities of each drug, but the\nGuidelines “go further and set sentences for the full range of\npossible drug quantities using the same\n100&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 quantity ratio.” 1995 Report 1.\nThe Guidelines’ drug quantity table sets base offense levels\nranging from 12, for offenses involving less than 250 milligrams of\ncrack (or 25 grams of powder), to 38, for offenses involving more\nthan 1.5 kilograms of crack (or 150 kilograms of powder). USSG\n§2D1.1(c).[ Footnote 8 ] B Although the Commission\nimmediately used the 100&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 ratio to define\nbase offense levels for all crack and powder offenses, it later\ndetermined that the crack/powder sentencing disparity is generally\nunwarranted. Based on additional research and experience with the\n100&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 ratio, the Commission concluded that\nthe disparity “fails to meet the sentencing objectives set forth by\nCongress in both the Sentencing Reform Act and the 1986 Act.” 2002\nReport 91. In a series of reports, the Commission identified\nthree problems with the crack/powder disparity. First, the Commission reported,\nthe 100&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 ratio rested on assumptions\nabout “the relative harmfulness of the two drugs and the relative\nprevalence of certain harmful conduct associated with their use and\ndistribution that more recent research and data no longer support.” Ibid.; see United States Sentencing Commission, Report to\nCongress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 8 (May 2007),\navailable at http://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/ cocaine2007.pdf\n(hereinafter 2007 Report) (ratio Congress embedded in the statute\nfar “overstate[s]” both “the relative harmfulness” of crack\ncocaine, and the “seriousness of most crack cocaine offenses”). For\nexample, the Commission found that crack is associated with\n“significantly less trafficking-related violence … than previously\nassumed.” 2002 Report 100. It also observed that “the negative\neffects of prenatal crack cocaine exposure are identical to the\nnegative effects of prenatal powder cocaine exposure.” Id. , at 94. The Commission furthermore noted that “the\nepidemic of crack cocaine use by youth never materialized to the\nextent feared.” Id. , at 96. Second, the Commission concluded that the\ncrack/powder disparity is inconsistent with the 1986 Act’s goal of\npunishing major drug traffickers more severely than low-level\ndealers. Drug importers and major traffickers generally deal in\npowder cocaine, which is then converted into crack by street-level\nsellers. See 1995 Report 66–67. But the\n100&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 ratio can lead to the “anomalous”\nresult that “retail crack dealers get longer sentences than the\nwholesale drug distributors who supply them the powder cocaine from\nwhich their crack is produced.” Id. , at 174. Finally, the Commission stated that the\ncrack/powder sentencing differential “fosters disrespect for and\nlack of confidence in the criminal justice system” because of a\n“widely-held perception” that it “promotes unwarranted disparity\nbased on race.” 2002 Report 103. Approximately 85 percent of\ndefendants convicted of crack offenses in federal court are black;\nthus the severe sentences required by the\n100&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 ratio are imposed “primarily upon\nblack offenders.” Ibid. Despite these observations, the Commission’s\nmost recent reports do not urge identical treatment of crack and\npowder cocaine. In the Commission’s view, “some differential in the\nquantity-based penalties” for the two drugs is warranted, id. , at 102, because crack is more addictive than powder,\ncrack offenses are more likely to involve weapons or bodily injury,\nand crack distribution is associated with higher levels of crime,\nsee id. , at 93–94, 101–102. But the\n100&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 crack/powder ratio, the Commission\nconcluded, significantly overstates the differences between the two\nforms of the drug. Accordingly, the Commission recommended that the\nratio be “substantially” reduced. Id. , at viii. C The Commission has several times\nsought to achieve a reduction in the crack/powder ratio. In 1995,\nit proposed amendments to the Guidelines that would have replaced\nthe 100&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 ratio with a\n1&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 ratio. Complementing that change, the\nCommission would have installed special enhancements for\ntrafficking offenses involving weapons or bodily injury. See\nAmendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for United States Courts,\n60 Fed. Reg. 25075–25077 (1995). Congress, acting pursuant to 28 U.\nS. C. §994(p),[ Footnote 9 ]\nrejected the amendments. See Pub. L. 104–38, §1, 109 Stat. 334.\nSimultaneously, however, Congress directed the Commission to\n“propose revision of the drug quantity ratio of crack cocaine to\npowder cocaine under the relevant statutes and guidelines.”\n§2(a)(2), id ., at 335. In response to this directive,\nthe Commission issued reports in 1997 and 2002 recommending that\nCongress change the 100&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 ratio prescribed\nin the 1986 Act. The 1997 Report proposed a\n5&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 ratio. See United States Sentencing\nCommission, Special Report to Congress: Cocaine and Federal\nSentencing Policy 2 (Apr. 1997),\nhttp://www.ussc.gov/r_congress/newcrack.pdf. The 2002 Report\nrecommended lowering the ratio “at least” to 20 to 1. 2002\nReport viii. Neither proposal prompted congressional\naction. The Commission’s most recent report, issued in\n2007, again urged Congress to amend the 1986 Act to reduce the\n100&nbhyph;to&nbhyph;1 ratio. This time, however, the\nCommission did not simply await congressional action. Instead, the\nCommission adopted an ameliorating change in the Guidelines. See\n2007 Report 9. The alteration, which became effective on November\n1, 2007, reduces the base offense level associated with each\nquantity of crack by two levels. See Amendments to the Sentencing\nGuidelines for United States Courts, 72 Fed. Reg. 28571–28572\n(2007).[ Footnote 10 ] This\nmodest amendment yields sentences for crack offenses between two\nand five times longer than sentences for equal amounts of powder.\nSee ibid .[ Footnote\n11 ] Describing the amendment as “only … a partial remedy” for\nthe problems generated by the crack/powder disparity, the\nCommission noted that “[a]ny comprehensive solution requires\nappropriate legislative action by Congress.” 2007\nReport 10. III With this history of the\ncrack/powder sentencing ratio in mind, we next consider the status\nof the Guidelines tied to the ratio after our decision in United States v. Booker , 543\nU. S. 220 (2005). In Booker , the Court held that the\nmandatory Sentencing Guidelines system violated the Sixth\nAmendment. See id. , at 226–227. The Booker remedial opinion determined that the appropriate cure was to sever\nand excise the provision of the statute that rendered the\nGuidelines mandatory, 18 U. S. C. §3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp.\nIV).[ Footnote 12 ] This\nmodification of the federal sentencing statute, we explained,\n“makes the Guidelines effectively advisory.” 543 U. S., at 245. The statute, as modified by Booker , contains an overarching provision instructing\ndistrict courts to “impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater\nthan necessary” to accomplish the goals of sentencing, including\n“to reflect the seriousness of the offense,” “to promote respect\nfor the law,” “to provide just punishment for the offense,” “to\nafford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,” and “to protect\nthe public from fur",

    "fulltext": "SYLLABUS OCTOBER TERM, 2006 PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS V.SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO.\n1 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v .\nSEATTLE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1 et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the ninth circuit No. 05–908. Argued December 4, 2006—Decided June\n28, 2007 Respondent school districts voluntarily adopted\nstudent assignment plans that rely on race to determine which\nschools certain children may attend. The Seattle district, which\nhas never operated legally segregated schools or been subject to\ncourt-ordered desegregation, classified children as white or\nnonwhite, and used the racial classifications as a “tiebreaker” to\nallocate slots in particular high schools. The Jefferson County,\nKy., district was subject to a desegregation decree until 2000,\nwhen the District Court dissolved the decree after finding that the\ndistrict had eliminated the vestiges of prior segregation to the\ngreatest extent practicable. In 2001, the district adopted its plan\nclassifying students as black or “other” in order to make certain\nelementary school assignments and to rule on transfer requests. Petitioners, an organization\nof Seattle parents (Parents Involved) and the mother of a Jefferson\nCounty student (Joshua), whose children were or could be assigned\nunder the foregoing plans, filed these suits contending, inter\nalia, that allocating children to different public schools\nbased solely on their race violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s\nequal protection guarantee. In the Seattle case, the District Court\ngranted the school district summary judgment, finding, inter\nalia, that its plan survived strict scrutiny on the federal\nconstitutional claim because it was narrowly tailored to serve a\ncompelling government interest. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. In the\nJefferson County case, the District Court found that the school\ndistrict had asserted a compelling interest in maintaining racially\ndiverse schools, and that its plan was, in all relevant respects,\nnarrowly tailored to serve that interest. The Sixth Circuit\naffirmed. Held: The judgments are reversed, and\nthe cases are remanded. No. 05–908, 426 F. 3d 1162; No. 05–915, 416\nF. 3d 513, reversed and remanded. The Chief Justice delivered the\nopinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III–A, and III–C,\nconcluding: 1. The Court has jurisdiction in these\ncases. Seattle argues that Parents Involved lacks standing because\nits current members’ claimed injuries are not imminent and are too\nspeculative in that, even if the district maintains its current\nplan and reinstitutes the racial tiebreaker, those members will\nonly be affected if their children seek to enroll in a high school\nthat is oversubscribed and integration positive. This argument is\nunavailing; the group’s members have children in all levels of the\ndistrict’s schools, and the complaint sought declaratory and\ninjunctive relief on behalf of members whose elementary and middle\nschool children may be denied admission to the high schools of\ntheir choice in the future. The fact that those children may not be\ndenied such admission based on their race because of\nundersubscription or oversubscription that benefits them does not\neliminate the injury claimed. The group also asserted an interest\nin not being forced to compete in a race-based system that might\nprejudice its members’ children, an actionable form of injury under\nthe Equal Protection Clause, see, e.g., Adarand Constructors,\nInc. v. Pe&nacute;a , 515 U. S. 200 , 211. The\nfact that Seattle has ceased using the racial tiebreaker pending\nthe outcome here is not dispositive, since the district vigorously\ndefends its program’s constitutionality, and nowhere suggests that\nit will not resume using race to assign students if it prevails.\nSee Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental\nServices (TOC), Inc. , 528 U. S. 167 , 189.\nSimilarly, the fact that Joshua has been granted a transfer does\nnot eliminate the Court’s jurisdiction; Jefferson County’s racial\nguidelines apply at all grade levels and he may again be subject to\nrace-based assignment in middle school. Pp. 9–11. 2. The school districts have not carried\ntheir heavy burden of showing that the interest they seek to\nachieve justifies the extreme means they have chosen—discriminating\namong individual students based on race by relying upon racial\nclassifications in making school assignments. Pp. 11–17,\n25–28. (a) Because “racial classifications are\nsimply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection\nbetween justification and classification,” Fullilove v. Klutznick , 448 U. S. 448 , 537\n(Stevens, J., dissenting), governmental distributions of burdens or\nbenefits based on individual racial classifications are reviewed\nunder strict scrutiny, e.g., Johnson v. California , 543 U. S. 499 , 505–506.\nThus, the school districts must demonstrate that their use of such\nclassifications is “narrowly tailored” to achieve a “compelling”\ngovernment interest. Adarand, supra , at 227. Although remedying the effects of past\nintentional discrimination is a compelling interest under the\nstrict scrutiny test, see Freeman v. Pitts , 503 U. S. 467 ,\n494, that interest is not involved here because the Seattle schools\nwere never segregated by law nor subject to court-ordered\ndesegregation, and the desegregation decree to which the Jefferson\nCounty schools were previously subject has been dissolved.\nMoreover, these cases are not governed by Grutter v. Bollinger , 539 U. S. 306 , 328, in which the Court\nheld that, for strict scrutiny purposes, a government interest in\nstudent body diversity “in the context of higher education” is\ncompelling. That interest was not focused on race alone but\nencompassed “all factors that may contribute to student body\ndiversity,” id., at 337, including, e.g., having\n“overcome personal adversity and family hardship,” id., at\n338. Quoting Justice Powell’s articulation of diversity in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , 438 U. S. 265 ,\n314–315, the Grutter Court noted that “ ‘it is not an\ninterest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified\npercentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be\nmembers of selected ethnic groups,’ that can justify the use of\nrace,” 539 U. S., at 324–325, but “ ‘a far broader array of\nqualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin\nis but a single though important element, ’ ” id., at 325. In the present cases, by contrast, race is\nnot considered as part of a broader effort to achieve “exposure to\nwidely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints,” id., at 330; race, for some students, is determinative\nstanding alone. The districts argue that other factors, such as\nstudent preferences, affect assignment decisions under their plans,\nbut under each plan when race comes into play, it is decisive by\nitself. It is not simply one factor weighed with others in reaching\na decision, as in Grutter ; it is the factor. See Gratz v. Bollinger , 539 U. S. 244 , 275. Even\nas to race, the plans here employ only a limited notion of\ndiversity, viewing race exclusively in white/nonwhite terms in\nSeattle and black/“other” terms in Jefferson County. The Grutter Court expressly limited its holding—defining a\nspecific type of broad-based diversity and noting the unique\ncontext of higher education—but these limitations were largely\ndisregarded by the lower courts in extending Grutter to\nthe sort of classifications at issue here. Pp. 11–17. (b) Despite the\ndistricts’ assertion that they employed individual racial\nclassifications in a way necessary to achieve their stated ends,\nthe minimal effect these classifications have on student\nassignments suggests that other means would be effective. Seattle’s\nracial tiebreaker results, in the end, only in shifting a small\nnumber of students between schools. Similarly, Jefferson County\nadmits that its use of racial classifications has had a minimal\neffect, and claims only that its guidelines provide a firm\ndefinition of the goal of racially integrated schools, thereby\nproviding administrators with authority to collaborate with\nprincipals and staff to maintain schools within the desired range.\nClassifying and assigning schoolchildren according to a binary\nconception of race is an extreme approach in light of this Court’s\nprecedents and the Nation’s history of using race in public\nschools, and requires more than such an amorphous end to justify\nit. In Grutter , in contrast, the consideration of race was\nviewed as indispensable in more than tripling minority\nrepresentation at the law school there at issue. See 539 U. S., at\n320. While the Court does not suggest that greater use of\nrace would be preferable, the minimal impact of the districts’\nracial classifications on school enrollment casts doubt on the\nnecessity of using such classifications. The districts have also\nfailed to show they considered methods other than explicit racial\nclassifications to achieve their stated goals. Narrow tailoring\nrequires “serious, good faith consideration of workable\nrace-neutral alternatives,” id., at 339, and yet in\nSeattle several alternative assignment plans—many of which would\nnot have used express racial classifications—were rejected with\nlittle or no consideration. Jefferson County has failed to present\nany evidence that it considered alternatives, even though the\ndistrict already claims that its goals are achieved primarily\nthrough means other than the racial classifications.\nPp. 25–28. the Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia,\nJustice Thomas, and Justice Alito, concluded for additional reasons\nin Parts III–B and IV that the plans at issue are unconstitutional\nunder this Court’s precedents. Pp. 17–25, 28–41. 1. The Court need not resolve the\nparties’ dispute over whether racial diversity in schools has a\nmarked impact on test scores and other objective yardsticks or\nachieves intangible socialization benefits because it is clear that\nthe racial classifications at issue are not narrowly tailored to\nthe asserted goal. In design and operation, the plans are directed\nonly to racial balance, an objective this Court has repeatedly\ncondemned as illegitimate. They are tied to each district’s\nspecific racial demographics, rather than to any pedagogic concept\nof the level of diversity needed to obtain the asserted educational\nbenefits. Whatever those demographics happen to be drives the\nrequired “diversity” number in each district. The districts offer\nno evidence that the level of racial diversity necessary to achieve\nthe asserted educational benefits happens to coincide with the\nracial demographics of the respective districts, or rather the\ndistricts’ white/nonwhite or black/“other” balance, since that is\nthe only diversity addressed by the plans. In Grutter , the\nnumber of minority students the school sought to admit was an\nundefined “meaningful number” necessary to achieve a genuinely\ndiverse student body, 539 U. S., at 316, 335–336, and the Court\nconcluded that the law school did not count back from its applicant\npool to arrive at that number, id., at 335–336. Here, in\ncontrast, the schools worked backward to achieve a particular type\nof racial balance, rather than working forward from some\ndemonstration of the level of diversity that provides the purported\nbenefits. This is a fatal flaw under the Court’s existing\nprecedent. See, e.g., Freeman, supra , at 494.\nAccepting racial balancing as a compelling state interest would\njustify imposing racial proportionality throughout American\nsociety, contrary to the Court’s repeated admonitions that this is\nunconstitutional. While the school districts use various verbal\nformulations to describe the interest they seek to promote—racial\ndiversity, avoidance of racial isolation, racial integration—they\noffer no definition suggesting that their interest differs from\nracial balancing. Pp. 17–25. 2. If the need for the racial\nclassifications embraced by the school districts is unclear, even\non the districts’ own terms, the costs are undeniable. Government\naction dividing people by race is inherently suspect because such\nclassifications promote “notions of racial inferiority and lead to\na politics of racial hostility,” Croson , supra ,\nat 493, “reinforce the belief, held by too many for too much of our\nhistory, that individuals should be judged by the color of their\nskin,” Shaw v. Reno , 509 U. S. 630 , 657, and\n“endorse race-based reasoning and the conception of a Nation\ndivided into racial blocs, thus contributing to an escalation of\nracial hostility and conflict,” Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC , 497\nU. S. 547 , 603 (O’Connor, J., dissenting). When it comes to\nusing race to assign children to schools, history will be heard. In Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U. S. 483 , the Court\nheld that segregation deprived black children of equal educational\nopportunities regardless of whether school facilities and other\ntangible factors were equal, because the classification and\nseparation themselves denoted inferiority. Id., at\n493–494. It was not the inequality of the facilities but the fact\nof legally separating children based on race on which the Court\nrelied to find a constitutional violation in that case. Id., at 494. The districts here invoke the ultimate goal\nof those who filed Brown and subsequent cases to support\ntheir argument, but the argument of the plaintiff in Brown was that the Equal Protection Clause “prevents states from\naccording differential treatment to American children on the basis\nof their color or race,” and that view prevailed—this Court ruled\nin its remedial opinion that Brown required school\ndistricts “to achieve a system of determining admission to the\npublic schools on a nonracial basis .” Brown v. Board of Education , 349 U. S. 294 , 300–301\n(emphasis added). Pp. 28–41. Justice Kennedy agreed that the Court has\njurisdiction to decide these cases and that respondents’ student\nassignment plans are not narrowly tailored to achieve the\ncompelling goal of diversity properly defined, but concluded that\nsome parts of the plurality opinion imply an unyielding insistence\nthat race cannot be a factor in instances when it may be taken into\naccount. Pp. 1–9. (a) As part of its burden of proving that\nracial classifications are narrowly tailored to further compelling\ninterests, the government must establish, in detail, how decisions\nbased on an individual student’s race are made in a challenged\nprogram. The Jefferson County Board of Education fails to meet this\nthreshold mandate when it concedes it denied Joshua’s requested\nkindergarten transfer on the basis of his race under its\nguidelines, yet also maintains that the guidelines do not apply to\nkindergartners. This discrepancy is not some simple and\nstraightforward error that touches only upon the peripheries of the\ndistrict’s use of individual racial classifications. As becomes\nclearer when the district’s plan is further considered, Jefferson\nCounty has explained how and when it employs these classifications\nonly in terms so broad and imprecise that they cannot withstand\nstrict scrutiny. In its briefing it fails to make clear—even in the\nlimited respects implicated by Joshua’s initial assignment and\ntransfer denial—whether in fact it relies on racial classifications\nin a manner narrowly tailored to the interest in question, rather\nthan in the far-reaching, inconsistent, and ad hoc manner that a less forgiving reading of the record would suggest.\nWhen a court subjects governmental action to strict scrutiny, it\ncannot construe ambiguities in favor of the government. In the\nSeattle case, the school district has gone further in describing\nthe methods and criteria used to determine assignment decisions\nbased on individual racial classifications, but it has nevertheless\nfailed to explain why, in a district composed of a diversity of\nraces, with only a minority of the students classified as “white,”\nit has employed the crude racial categories of “white” and\n“non-white” as the basis for its assignment decisions. Far from\nbeing narrowly tailored, this system threatens to defeat its own\nends, and the district has provided no convincing explanation for\nits design. Pp. 2–6. (b) The plurality opinion is too\ndismissive of government’s legitimate interest in ensuring that all\npeople have equal opportunity regardless of their race. In\nadministering public schools, it is permissible to consider the\nschools’ racial makeup and adopt general policies to encourage a\ndiverse student body, one aspect of which is its racial\ncomposition. Cf. Grutter v. Bollinger , 539 U. S. 306 . School authorities\nconcerned that their student bodies’ racial compositions interfere\nwith offering an equal educational opportunity to all are free to\ndevise race-conscious measures to address the problem in a general\nway and without treating each student in different fashion based\nsolely on a systematic, individual typing by race. Such measures\nmay include strategic site selection of new schools; drawing\nattendance zones with general recognition of neighborhood\ndemographics; allocating resources for special programs; recruiting\nstudents and faculty in a targeted fashion; and tracking\nenrollments, performance, and other statistics by race. Each respondent has failed to provide the\nnecessary support for the proposition that there is no other way\nthan individual racial classifications to avoid racial isolation in\ntheir school districts. Cf. Richmond v. J. A. Croson\nCo. , 488 U. S.\n469 , 501. In these cases, the fact that the number of students\nwhose assignment depends on express racial classifications is small\nsuggests that the schools could have achieved their stated ends\nthrough different means, including the facially race-neutral means\nset forth above or, if necessary, a more nuanced, individual\nevaluation of school needs and student characteristics that might\ninclude race as a component. The latter approach would be informed\nby Grutter , though the criteria relevant to student\nplacement would differ based on the students’ age, the parents’\nneeds, and the schools’ role. Pp. 6–9.

MEREDITH, custodial parent and next\nfriend of JOSHUA RYAN McDONALD, PETITIONER 05–915 v. JEFFERSON COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION\net al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit [June 28, 2007] Chief Justice Roberts announced the judgment of the Court, and delivered the opinion of\nthe Court with respect to Parts I, II, III–A, and III–C, and an\nopinion with respect to Parts III–B and IV, in which Justices\nScalia, Thomas, and Alito join. The school districts in these\ncases voluntarily adopted student assignment plans that rely upon\nrace to determine which public schools certain children may attend.\nThe Seattle school district classifies children as white or\nnonwhite; the Jefferson County school district as black or “other.”\nIn Seattle, this racial classification is used to allocate slots in\noversubscribed high schools. In Jefferson County, it is used to\nmake certain elementary school assignments and to rule on transfer\nrequests. In each case, the school district relies upon an\nindividual student’s race in assigning that student to a particular\nschool, so that the racial balance at the school falls within a\npredetermined range based on the racial composition of the school\ndistrict as a whole. Parents of students denied assignment to\nparticular schools under these plans solely because of their race\nbrought suit, contending that allocating children to different\npublic schools on the basis of race violated the Fourteenth\nAmendment guarantee of equal protection. The Courts of Appeals\nbelow upheld the plans. We granted certiorari, and now reverse. I Both cases present the same\nunderlying legal question—whether a public school that had not\noperated legally segregated schools or has been found to be unitary\nmay choose to classify students by race and rely upon that\nclassification in making school assignments. Although we examine\nthe plans under the same legal framework, the specifics of the two\nplans, and the circumstances surrounding their adoption, are in\nsome respects quite different. A Seattle School District No. 1\noperates 10 regular public high schools. In 1998, it adopted the\nplan at issue in this case for assigning students to these schools.\nApp. in No. 05–908, pp. 90a–92a.[ Footnote 1 ] The plan allows incoming ninth graders to\nchoose from among any of the district’s high schools, ranking\nhowever many schools they wish in order of preference. Some schools are more popular\nthan others. If too many students list the same school as their\nfirst choice, the district employs a series of “tiebreakers” to\ndetermine who will fill the open slots at the oversubscribed\nschool. The first tiebreaker selects for admission students who\nhave a sibling currently enrolled in the chosen school. The next\ntiebreaker depends upon the racial composition of the particular\nschool and the race of the individual student. In the district’s\npublic schools approximately 41 percent of enrolled students are\nwhite; the remaining 59 percent, comprising all other racial\ngroups, are classified by Seattle for assignment purposes as\nnonwhite. Id., at 38a, 103a.[ Footnote 2 ] If an oversubscribed school is not within 10\npercentage points of the district’s overall white/nonwhite racial\nbalance, it is what the district calls “integration positive,” and\nthe district employs a tiebreaker that selects for assignment\nstudents whose race “will serve to bring the school into balance.” Id., at 38a. See Parents Involved VII, 426\nF. 3d 1162, 1169–1170 (CA9 2005) (en banc).[ Footnote 3 ] If it is still necessary to select\nstudents for the school after using the racial tiebreaker, the next\ntiebreaker is the geographic proximity of the school to the\nstudent’s residence. App. in No. 05–908, at 38a. Seattle has never operated segregated\nschools—legally separate schools for students of different\nraces—nor has it ever been subject to court-ordered desegregation.\nIt nonetheless employs the racial tiebreaker in an attempt to\naddress the effects of racially identifiable housing patterns on\nschool assignments. Most white students live in the northern part\nof Seattle, most students of other racial backgrounds in the\nsouthern part. Parents Involved VII , supra , at\n1166. Four of Seattle’s high schools are located in the\nnorth—Ballard, Nathan Hale, Ingraham, and Roosevelt—and five in the\nsouth—Rainier Beach, Cleveland, West Seattle, Chief Sealth, and\nFranklin. One school—Garfield—is more or less in the center of\nSeattle. App. in No. 05–908, at 38a–39a, 45a. For the 2000–2001 school year, five of these\nschools were oversubscribed—Ballard, Nathan Hale, Roosevelt,\nGarfield, and Franklin—so much so that 82 percent of incoming ninth\ngraders ranked one of these schools as their first choice. Id., at 38a. Three of the oversubscribed schools were\n“integration positive” because the school’s white enrollment the\nprevious school year was greater than 51 percent—Ballard, Nathan\nHale, and Roosevelt. Thus, more nonwhite students (107, 27, and 82,\nrespectively) who selected one of these three schools as a top\nchoice received placement at the school than would have been the\ncase had race not been considered, and proximity been the next\ntiebreaker. Id., at 39a–40a. Franklin was “integration\npositive” because its nonwhite enrollment the previous school year\nwas greater than 69 percent; 89 more white students were assigned\nto Franklin by operation of the racial tiebreaker in the 2000–2001\nschool year than otherwise would have been. Ibid. Garfield\nwas the only oversubscribed school whose composition during the\n1999–2000 school year was within the racial guidelines, although in\nprevious years Garfield’s enrollment had been predominantly\nnonwhite, and the racial tiebreaker had been used to give\npreference to white students. Id., at 39a. Petitioner Parents Involved in Community\nSchools (Parents Involved) is a nonprofit corporation comprising\nthe parents of children who have been or may be denied assignment\nto their chosen high school in the district because of their race.\nThe concerns of Parents Involved are illustrated by Jill Kurfirst,\nwho sought to enroll her ninth-grade son, Andy Meeks, in Ballard\nHigh School’s special Biotechnology Career Academy. Andy suffered\nfrom attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia, but had\nmade good progress with hands-on instruction, and his mother and\nmiddle school teachers thought that the smaller biotechnology\nprogram held the most promise for his continued success. Andy was\naccepted into this selective program but, because of the racial\ntiebreaker, was denied assignment to Ballard High School. Id., at 143a–146a, 152a–160a. Parents Involved commenced\nthis suit in the Western District of Washington, alleging that\nSeattle’s use of race in assignments violated the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment,[ Footnote 4 ] Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964,[ Footnote 5 ] and the\nWashington Civil Rights Act.[ Footnote 6 ] Id., at 28a–35a. The District Court granted summary judgment to\nthe school district, finding that state law did not bar the\ndistrict’s use of the racial tiebreaker and that the plan survived\nstrict scrutiny on the federal constitutional claim because it was\nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. 137\nF. Supp. 2d 1224, 1240 (WD Wash. 2001) ( Parents Involved\nI ). The Ninth Circuit initially reversed based on its\ninterpretation of the Washington Civil Rights Act, 285 F. 3d\n1236, 1253 (2002) ( Parents Involved II ), and enjoined the\ndistrict’s use of the integration tiebreaker, id., at\n1257. Upon realizing that the litigation would not be resolved in\ntime for assignment decisions for the 2002–2003 school year, the\nNinth Circuit withdrew its opinion, 294 F. 3d 1084 (2002)\n( Parents Involved III ), vacated the injunction, and,\npursuant to Wash. Rev. Code §2.60.020 (2006), certified the\nstate-law question to the Washington Supreme Court, 294 F. 3d\n1085, 1087 (2002) ( Parents Involved IV ). The Washington Supreme Court determined that\nthe State Civil Rights Act bars only preferential treatment\nprograms “where race or gender is used by government to select a\nless qualified applicant over a more qualified applicant,” and not\n“[p]rograms which are racially neutral, such as the [district’s]\nopen choice plan.” Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist., No. 1, 149 Wash. 2d 660, 689–690,\n663, 72 P. 3d 151, 166, 153 (2003) (en banc) ( Parents\nInvolved V ). The state court returned the case to the Ninth\nCircuit for further proceedings. Id., at 690, 72\nP. 3d, at 167. A panel of the Ninth Circuit then again\nreversed the District Court, this time ruling on the federal\nconstitutional question. Parents Involved VI, 377\nF. 3d 949 (2004). The panel determined that while achieving\nracial diversity and avoiding racial isolation are compelling\ngovernment interests, id., at 964, Seattle’s use of the\nracial tiebreaker was not narrowly tailored to achieve these\ninterests, id., at 980. The Ninth Circuit granted\nrehearing en banc, 395 F. 3d 1168 (2005), and overruled the\npanel decision, affirming the District Court’s determination that\nSeattle’s plan was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling\ngovernment interest, Parents Involved VII , 426 F. 3d,\nat 1192–1193. We granted certiorari. 547 U. S. __ (2006). B Jefferson County Public Schools\noperates the public school system in metropolitan Louisville,\nKentucky. In 1973 a federal court found that Jefferson County had\nmaintained a segregated school system, Newburg Area Council,\nInc. v. Board of Ed. of Jefferson Cty. , 489\nF. 2d 925, 932 (CA6), vacated and remanded, 418 U. S. 918 ,\nreinstated with modifications, 510 F. 2d 1358, 1359 (CA6\n1974), and in 1975 the District Court entered a desegregation\ndecree. See Hampton v. Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Ed. ,\n72 F. Supp. 2d 753, 762–764 (WD Ky. 1999). Jefferson County\noperated under this decree until 2000, when the District Court\ndissolved the decree after finding that the district had achieved\nunitary status by eliminating “[t]o the greatest extent\npracticable” the vestiges of its prior policy of segregation. Hampton v. Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Ed. , 102\nF. Supp. 2d 358, 360 (2000). See Board of Ed. of Oklahoma\nCity Public Schools v. Dowell , 498 U. S. 237 , 249–250\n(1991); Green v. School Bd. of New Kent Cty. , 391 U. S. 430 ,\n435–436 (1968). In 2001, after the decree had\nbeen dissolved, Jefferson County adopted the voluntary student\nassignment plan at issue in this case. App. in No. 05–915, p. 77.\nApproximately 34 percent of the district’s 97,000 students are\nblack; most of the remaining 66 percent are white. McFarland v. Jefferson Cty. Public Schools , 330\nF. Supp. 2d 834, 839–840, and n. 6 (WD Ky. 2004)\n( McFarland I ). The plan requires all nonmagnet schools to\nmaintain a minimum black enrollment of 15 percent, and a maximum\nblack enrollment of 50 percent. App. in No. 05–915, at 81; McFarland I , supra , at 842. At the elementary school level, based on his\nor her address, each student is designated a “resides” school to\nwhich students within a specific geographic area are assigned;\nelementary resides schools are “grouped into clusters in order to\nfacilitate integration.” App. in No. 05–915, at 82. The district\nassigns students to nonmagnet schools in one of two ways: Parents\nof kindergartners, first-graders, and students new to the district\nmay submit an application indicating a first and second choice\namong the schools within their cluster; students who do not submit\nsuch an application are assigned within the cluster by the\ndistrict. “Decisions to assign students to schools within each\ncluster are based on available space within the schools and the\nracial guidelines in the District’s current student assignment\nplan.” Id., at 38. If a school has reached the “extremes\nof the racial guidelines,” a student whose race would contribute to\nthe school’s racial imbalance will not be assigned there. Id., at 38–39, 82. After assignment, students at all grade\nlevels are permitted to apply to transfer between nonmagnet schools\nin the district. Transfers may be requested for any number of\nreasons, and may be denied because of lack of available space or on\nthe basis of the racial guidelines. Id., at 43.[ Footnote 7 ] When petitioner Crystal Meredith moved into\nthe school district in August 2002, she sought to enroll her son,\nJoshua McDonald, in kindergarten for the 2002–2003 school year. His\nresides school was only a mile from his new home, but it had no\navailable space—assignments had been made in May, and the class was\nfull. Jefferson County assigned Joshua to another elementary school\nin his cluster, Young Elementary. This school was 10 miles from\nhome, and Meredith sought to transfer Joshua to a school in a\ndifferent cluster, Bloom Elementary, which—like his resides\nschool—was only a mile from home. See Tr. in McFarland I, pp. 1–49 through 1–54 (Dec. 8, 2003). Space was available at\nBloom, and intercluster transfers are allowed, but Joshua’s\ntransfer was nonetheless denied because, in the words of Jefferson\nCounty, “[t]he transfer would have an adverse effect on\ndesegregation compliance” of Young. App. in No. 05–915, at\n97.[ Footnote 8 ] Meredith brought suit in the Western District\nof Kentucky, alleging violations of the Equal Protection Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court found that Jefferson\nCounty had asserted a compelling interest in maintaining racially\ndiverse schools, and that the assignment plan was (in all relevant\nrespects) narrowly ta",
    "textpassage": "The Seattle school district classifies children as white or nonwhite; the Jefferson County school district as black or “other.” In each case, the school district relies upon an individual student’s race in assigning that student to a particular school, so that the racial balance at the school falls within a predetermined range based on the racial composition of the school district as a whole."

WYNER\net al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the eleventh circuit No. 06–531. Argued April 17, 2007—Decided June 4,\n2007 In private actions under 42 U. S. C. §1983,\nfederal district courts may “allow the prevailing party … a\nreasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs.” §1988(b).\nPlaintiff-respondent Wyner notified the Florida Department of\nEnvironmental Protection (DEP), in mid-January 2003, of her\nintention to create on Valentine’s Day, within MacArthur State\nBeach Park, an antiwar artwork consisting of nude individuals\nassembled into a peace sign. Responding on February 6, DEP informed\nWyner that her display would be lawful only if the participants\ncomplied with Florida’s “Bathing Suit Rule,” which requires patrons\nof state parks to wear, at a minimum, a thong and, if female, a\nbikini top. To safeguard her display, and future nude expressive\nactivities, against police interference, Wyner and a coplaintiff\n(collectively Wyner or plaintiff) sued Florida officials in the\nFederal District Court on February 12. Invoking the First\nAmendment’s protection of expressive conduct, Wyner requested\nimmediate injunctive relief against interference with the peace\nsign display and permanent injunctive relief against interference\nwith future activities similarly involving nudity. An attachment to\nthe complaint set out a 1995 settlement with DEP permitting Wyner\nto stage a play with nude performers at MacArthur Beach provided\nthe area was screened off to shield beachgoers who did not wish to\nsee the play. Although disconcerted by the hurried character of the\nproceeding, the District Court granted Wyner a preliminary\ninjunction on February 13, suggesting that a curtain or screen\ncould satisfy the interests of both the State and Wyner. The peace\nsymbol display that took place the next day was set up outside a\nbarrier apparently put up by the State. Once disassembled from the\npeace symbol formation, participants went into the water in the\nnude. Thereafter, Wyner pursued her demand for a permanent\ninjunction, noting that she intended to put on another Valentine’s\nDay production at MacArthur Beach, again involving nudity. After\ndiscovery, both sides moved for summary judgment. At a January 21,\n2004 hearing, Wyner’s counsel acknowledged that the peace symbol\ndisplay participants had set up in front of the barrier. The court\ndenied plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and granted\ndefendants’ motion for summary final judgment. The deliberate\nfailure of Wyner and her coparticipants to stay behind the screen\nat the 2003 Valentine’s Day display, the court concluded,\ndemonstrated that the Bathing Suit Rule’s prohibition of nudity was\nessential to protect the visiting public. While Wyner ultimately\nfailed to prevail on the merits, the court added, she did obtain a\npreliminary injunction, and therefore qualified as a prevailing\nparty to that extent. Reasoning that the preliminary injunction\ncould not be revisited at the second stage of the litigation\nbecause it had expired, the court awarded plaintiff counsel fees\ncovering the first phase of the litigation. The Florida officials\nappealed, challenging both the preliminary injunction and the\ncounsel fees award. The Eleventh Circuit held first that\ndefendants’ challenges to the preliminary injunction were moot. The\ncourt then affirmed the counsel fees award, reasoning that the\npreliminary order allowed Wyner to present the peace symbol display\nunimpeded by adverse state action. Held: Prevailing party status does\nnot attend achievement of a preliminary injunction that is\nreversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone by the final decision in\nthe same case. Pp. 6–11. (a) “The touchstone of the\nprevailing party inquiry” this Court has stated, is “the material\nalteration of the legal relationship of the parties in a manner\nwhich Congress sought to promote in the fee statute.” Texas\nState Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School\nDist. , 489 U.\nS. 782 , 792–793. At the preliminary injunction stage, the court\nis called upon to assess the probability of the plaintiff’s\nultimate success on the merits. The foundation for that assessment\nwill be more or less secure depending on the thoroughness of the\nexploration undertaken by the parties and the court. In this case,\nthe preliminary injunction hearing was necessarily hasty and\nabbreviated. There was no time for discovery, nor for adequate\nreview of documents or preparation and presentation of witnesses.\nThe provisional relief granted expired before appellate review\ncould be gained, and the court’s threshold ruling would have no\npreclusive effect in the continuing litigation, as both the\nDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals considered the preliminary\ninjunction moot once the display took place. The provisional\nrelief’s tentative character, in view of the continuation of the\nlitigation to definitively resolve the controversy, would have made\na fee request at the initial stage premature. Of controlling\nimportance, the eventual ruling on the merits for defendants, after\nboth sides considered the case fit for final adjudication,\nsuperseded the preliminary ruling. Wyner’s temporary success rested\non a premise—the understanding that a curtain or screen would\nadequately serve Florida’s interest in shielding the public from\nnudity—that the District Court, with the benefit of a fuller\nrecord, ultimately rejected. Wyner contends that the preliminary\ninjunction was not undermined by the subsequent merits adjudication\nbecause the decision to grant preliminary relief was an “as\napplied” ruling based on the officials’ impermissible content-based\nadministration of the Bathing Suit Rule. But the District Court\nassumed content neutrality for purposes of its preliminary order.\nThe final decision in Wyner’s case rejected the same claim she\nadvanced in her preliminary injunction motion: that the state law\nbanning nudity in parks was unconstitutional as applied to\nexpressive, nonerotic nudity. At the end of the fray, Florida’s\nBathing Suit Rule remained intact. Wyner had gained no enduring\n“chang[e] [in] the legal relationship” between herself and the\nstate officials she sued. See Texas State Teachers Assn. ,\n489 U. S., at 792. Pp. 6–10. (b) Wyner is not a prevailing party, for\nher initial victory was ephemeral. This Court expresses no view on\nwhether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a\nclaim for permanent injunctive relief, success in gaining a\npreliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel\nfees. It decides only that a plaintiff who gains a preliminary\ninjunction does not qualify for an award of counsel fees under\n§1988(b) if the merits of the case are ultimately decided against\nher. Pp. 10–11. 179 Fed. Appx. 566, reversed and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the\nopinion for a unanimous Court. OPINION OF THE COURT SOLE V. WYNER 551 U. S. ____ (2007) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 06-531 MICHAEL W. SOLE, SECRETARY, FLORIDA DEPART- MENT OF\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, et al., PETITIONERS v. T. A. WYNER et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eleventh circuit [June 4, 2007] Justice Ginsburg delivered the\nopinion of the Court. For private actions brought under\n42 U. S. C. §1983 and other specified measures designed to\nsecure civil rights, Congress established an exception to the\n“American Rule” that “the prevailing litigant is ordinarily not\nentitled to collect [counsel fees] from the loser.” Alyeska\nPipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society , 421 U. S. 240 , 247\n(1975). That exception, codified in 42 U. S. C. §1988(b),\nauthorizes federal district courts, in their discretion, to “allow\nthe prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of\nthe costs.” This case presents a sole question: Does a plaintiff\nwho gains a preliminary injunction after an abbreviated hearing,\nbut is denied a permanent injunction after a dispositive\nadjudication on the merits, qualify as a “prevailing party” within\nthe compass of §1988(b)? Viewing the two stages of the litigation as\ndiscrete episodes, plaintiffs below, respondents here, maintain\nthat they prevailed at the preliminary injunction stage, and\ntherefore qualify for a fee award for their counsels’ efforts to\nobtain that interim relief. Defendants below, petitioners here,\nregard the case as a unit; they urge that a preliminary injunction\nholds no sway once fuller consideration yields rejection of the\nprovisional order’s legal or factual underpinnings. We agree with\nthe latter position and hold that a final decision on the merits\ndenying permanent injunctive relief ordinarily determines who\nprevails in the action for purposes of §1988(b). A plaintiff who\nachieves a transient victory at the threshold of an action can gain\nno award under that fee-shifting provision if, at the end of the\nlitigation, her initial success is undone and she leaves the\ncourthouse emptyhanded. I In mid-January 2003,\nplaintiff-respondent T. A. Wyner notified the Florida Department of\nEnvironmental Protection (DEP) of her intention to create on\nValentine’s Day, February 14, 2003, within John D. MacArthur Beach\nState Park, an antiwar artwork. The work would consist of nude\nindividuals assembled into a peace sign. By letter dated February\n6, DEP informed Wyner that her peace sign display would be lawful\nonly if the participants complied with the “Bathing Suit Rule” set\nout in Florida Administrative Code §62D–2.014(7)(b) (2005). That\nrule required patrons, in all areas of Florida’s state parks, to\nwear, at a minimum, a thong and, if female, a bikini top.[ Footnote 1 ] To safeguard the Valentine’s Day\ndisplay, and future expressive activities of the same order,\nagainst police interference, Wyner filed suit in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Florida on February 12,\n2003. She invoked the First Amendment’s protection of expressive\nconduct, and named as defendants the Secretary of DEP and the\nManager of MacArthur Beach Park.[ Footnote 2 ] Her complaint requested immediate injunctive\nrelief against interference with the peace sign display, App. 18,\nand permanent injunctive relief against interference with “future\nexpressive activities that may include non-erotic displays of nude\nhuman bodies,” id ., at 19. An exhibit attached to the\ncomplaint set out a May 12, 1995 Stipulation for Settlement with\nDEP. Id ., at 22–23. That settlement had facilitated a\nFebruary 19, 1996 play Wyner coordinated at MacArthur Beach, a\nproduction involving nude performers. A term of the settlement\nprovided that Wyner would “arrange for placement of a bolt of cloth\nin a semi-circle around the area where the play [would] be\nperformed,” id ., at 23, so that beachgoers who did not\nwish to see the play would be shielded from the nude\nperformers. The day after the complaint was filed, on\nFebruary 13, 2003, the District Court heard Wyner’s emergency\nmotion for a preliminary injunction. Although disconcerted by the\nhurried character of the proceeding, see id ., at 37, 93,\n95, the court granted the preliminary injunction. “The choice,” the\ncourt explained, “need not be either/or.” Wyner v. Struhs , 254 F. Supp. 2d 1297, 1303 (SD Fla. 2003).\nPointing to the May 1995 settlement laying out “agreed-upon manner\nrestrictions,” the court determined that “[p]laintiff[’s] desired\nexpression and the interests of the state may both be satisfied\nsimultaneously.” Ibid. In this regard, the court had\ninquired of DEP’s counsel at the preliminary injunction hearing:\n“Why wouldn’t the curtain or screen solve the problem of somebody\n[who] doesn’t want to see . . . nudity? Seems like that would solve\n[the] problem, wouldn’t it?” App. 86. Counsel for DEP responded:\n“That’s an option. I don’t think necessarily [defendants] would be\nopposed to that … .” Ibid . ; see id. , at 74 (testimony of Chief of Operations for Florida\nPark Service at the preliminary injunction hearing that the\nService’s counsel, on prior occasions, had advised: “[I]f they go\nbehind the screen and they liv[e] up to the agreement then it’s\nokay. If they don’t go behind the screen and they don’t live up to\nthe agreement then it’s not okay.”). The peace symbol display took place at\nMacArthur Beach the next day. A screen was put up, apparently by\nthe State, as the District Court anticipated. See id ., at\n108. See also id. , at 94 (District Judge’s statement at\nthe conclusion of the preliminary injunction hearing: “I want to\nmake it clear . . . that the [preliminary] injunction doesn’t\npreclude the department, if it chooses, from using … some sort of\nbarrier . . . .”). But the display was set up outside the barrier,\nand participants, once disassembled from the peace symbol\nformation, went into the water in the nude. See id ., at\n108; Deposition of T. A. Wyner in Civ. Action No. 03–80103 (SD\nFla., Nov. 14, 2003), pp. 99–100. Thereafter, Wyner pursued her demand for a\npermanent injunction. Her counsel represented that on February 14,\n2004, Wyner intended to put on another production at MacArthur\nBeach, again involving nudity. See App. 107. After discovery, both\nsides moved for summary judgment. At the hearing on the motions,\nheld January 21, 2004, the District Court asked Wyner’s counsel\nabout the screen put up around the preceding year’s peace symbol\ndisplay. Counsel acknowledged that the participants in that display\nignored the barrier and set up in front of the screen. Id ., at 108. A week later, having unsuccessfully urged the\nparties to resolve the case as “[they] did before in [the 1995]\nsettlement,” id ., at 143, the court denied plaintiff’s\nmotion for summary judgment and granted defendants’ motion for\nsummary final judgment. The deliberate failure of Wyner and her\ncoparticipants to remain behind the screen at the 2003 Valentine’s\nDay display, the court concluded, demonstrated that the Bathing\nSuit Rule’s prohibition of nudity was “no greater than is essential\n. . . to protect the experiences of the visiting public.” Wyner v. Struhs , Case No. 03–80103–CIV (SD Fla.,\nJan. 28, 2004) (Summary Judgment Order), App. to Pet. for Cert.\n42a. While Wyner ultimately failed to prevail on the merits, the\ncourt added, she did obtain a preliminary injunction prohibiting\npolice interference with the Valentine’s Day 2003 temporary art\ninstallation, id ., at 45a, and therefore qualified as a\nprevailing party to that extent, see Wyner v. Struhs , Case No. 03–80103–CIV (SD Fla., Aug. 16, 2004)\n(Omnibus Order), App. to Brief in Opposition 5a–13a. The\npreliminary injunction could not be revisited at the second stage\nof the litigation, the court noted, for it had “expired on its own\nterms.” Id. , at 4a. So reasoning, the court awarded\nplaintiff counsel fees covering the first phase of the\nlitigation. The Florida officials appealed, challenging\nboth the order granting a preliminary injunction and the award of\ncounsel fees. Wyner, however, pursued no appeal from the final\norder denying a permanent injunction. The Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit held first that defendants’ challenges to the\npreliminary injunction were moot because they addressed “a finite\nevent that occurred and ended on a specific, past date.” Wyner v. Struhs , 179 Fed. Appx. 566, 567,\nn. 1 (2006) (per curiam) . The court then affirmed the\ncounsel fees award, reasoning that plaintiff had gained through the\npreliminary injunction “the primary relief [she] sought,” i.e. , the preliminary order allowed her to present the\npeace symbol display unimpeded by adverse state action. Id. , at 569. Wyner would not have qualified for an award of\ncounsel fees, the court recognized, had the preliminary injunction\nrested on a mistake of law. Id. , at 568, 569–570. But it\nwas “new developments,” the court said, id ., at 569, not\nany legal error, that accounted for her failure “to achieve actual\nsuccess on the merits at the permanent injunction stage,” id. , at 569, n. 7. Plaintiff and others participating\nin the display, as Wyner’s counsel admitted, did not stay behind\nthe barrier at the peace symbol display, id. , at 569;\nfurther, the court noted, “a fair reading of the record show[ed]\nthat [p]laintif[f] had no intention of remaining behind a [barrier]\nduring future nude expressive works,” ibid . The likelihood\nof success shown at the preliminary injunction stage, the court\nexplained, id. , at 569, n. 7, had been overtaken by\nthe subsequent “demonstrat[ion] that the less restrictive\nalternative,” i.e. , a cloth screen or other barrier, “was\nnot sufficient to protect the government’s interest,” id. ,\nat 569. But that demonstration, the court concluded, did not bar an\naward of fees, because the “new facts” emerged only at the summary\njudgment stage. Ibid . We granted certiorari, Struhs v. Wyner , 549 U. S. ___ (2007), and now\nreverse. II “The touchstone of the prevailing\nparty inquiry,” this Court has stated, is “the material alteration\nof the legal relationship of the parties in a manner which Congress\nsought to promote in the fee statute.” Texas State Teachers\nAssn. v. Garland Independent School Dist. , 489 U. S. 782 , 792–793\n(1989). See Hewitt v. Helms , 482 U. S. 755 , 760\n(1987) (plaintiff must “receive at least some relief on the merits\nof his claim before he can be said to prevail”); Maher v. Gagne , 448\nU. S. 122 , 129 (1980) (upholding fees where plaintiffs settled\nand obtained a consent decree); cf. Buckhannon Board & Care\nHome, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human\nResources , 532 U. S. 598 , 605 (2001) (precedent\n“counsel[s] against holding that the term ‘prevailing party’\nauthorizes an award of attorney’s fees without a\ncorresponding alteration in the legal relationship of the\nparties”).[ Footnote 3 ] The\npetitioning state officials maintain that plaintiff here does not\nsatisfy that standard for, as a consequence of the final summary\njudgment, “[t]he state law whose constitutionality [Wyner] attacked\n[ i.e ., the Bathing Suit Rule,] remains valid and\nenforceable today.” Brief for Petitioners 3. The District Court\nleft no doubt on that score, the state officials emphasize;\nordering final judgment for defendants, the court expressed, in the\nbottom line of its opinion, its “hope” that plaintiff would\ncontinue to use the park, “albeit not in the nude.” Summary\nJudgment Order, App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a. Wyner, on the other hand, urges\nthat despite the denial of a permanent injunction, she got\nprecisely what she wanted when she commenced this litigation:\npermission to create the nude peace symbol without state\ninterference. That fleeting success, however, did not establish\nthat she prevailed on the gravamen of her plea for injunctive\nrelief, i.e ., her charge that the state officials had\ndenied her and other participants in the peace symbol display “the\nright to engage in constitutionally protected expressive\nactivities.” App. 18. Prevailing party status, we hold, does not\nattend achievement of a preliminary injunction that is reversed,\ndissolved, or otherwise undone by the final decision in the same\ncase.[ Footnote 4 ] At the preliminary injunction stage, the\ncourt is called upon to assess the probability of the plaintiff’s\nultimate success on the merits. See, e.g ., Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union , 542 U. S. 656 ,\n666 (2004); Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc. , 422 U. S. 922 , 931\n(1975). The foundation for that assessment will be more or less\nsecure depending on the thoroughness of the exploration undertaken\nby the parties and the court. In some cases, the proceedings prior\nto a grant of temporary relief are searching; in others, little\ntime and resources are spent on the threshold contest. In this case, the preliminary injunction\nhearing was necessarily hasty and abbreviated. Held one day after\nthe complaint was filed and one day before the event, the timing\nafforded the state officer defendants little opportunity to oppose\nWyner’s emergency motion. Counsel for the state defendants appeared\nonly by telephone. App. 36. The emergency proceeding allowed no\ntime for discovery, nor for adequate review of documents or\npreparation and presentation of witnesses. See id ., at\n38–39. The provisional relief immediately granted expired before\nappellate review could be gained, and the court’s threshold ruling\nwould have no preclusive effect in the continuing litigation. Both\nthe District Court and the Court of Appeals considered the\npreliminary injunction a moot issue, not fit for reexamination or\nreview, once the display took place. See Summary Judgment Order,\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 34a; Omnibus Order, App. to Brief in\nOpposition 3a–4a; 179 Fed. Appx., at 567, n. 1; cf. Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp. , 494 U. S. 472 , 477–479\n(1990). In short, the provisional relief granted terminated only\nthe parties’ opening engagement. Its tentative character, in view\nof the continuation of the litigation to definitively resolve the\ncontroversy, would have made a fee request at the initial stage\npremature. Of controlling importance to our decision, the\neventual ruling on the merits for defendants, after both sides\nconsidered the case fit for final adjudication, superseded the\npreliminary ruling. Wyner’s temporary success rested on a premise\nthe District Court ultimately rejected. That court granted\npreliminary relief on the understanding that a curtain or screen\nwould adequately serve Florida’s interest in shielding the public\nfrom nudity that recreational beach users did not wish to see. See supra , at 3–4; 254 F. Supp. 2d, at 1303\n(noting that the parties had previously agreed upon “a number of .\n. . manner restrictions that are far less restrictive than the\ntotal ban on nudity”). At the summary judgment stage, with the\nbenefit of a fuller record, the District Court recognized that its\ninitial assessment was incorrect. Participants in the peace symbol\ndisplay were in fact unwilling to stay behind a screen that\nseparated them from other park visitors. See Summary Judgment\nOrder, App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a. See also App. 108\n(acknowledgment by Wyner’s counsel that participants in the\nFebruary 14, 2003 protest “in effec[t] ignored the screen”). In\nlight of the demonstrated inadequacy of the screen to contain the\nnude display, the District Court determined that enforcement of the\nBathing Suit Rule was necessary to “preserv[e] park aesthetics” and\n“protect the experiences of the visiting public.” Summary Judgment\nOrder, App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a, 42a. Wyner contends that the\npreliminary injunction was not undermined by the subsequent\nadjudication on the merits because the decision to grant\npreliminary relief was an “as applied” ruling. In developing this\nargument, she asserts that the officials engaged in impermissible\ncontent-based administration of the Bathing Suit Rule. But the\nDistrict Court assumed, “for the purposes of [its initial] order,”\nthe content neutrality of the state officials’ conduct. See 254\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1302. See also 179 Fed. Appx., at 568, and n.\n4 (reiterating that, “for the sake of the preliminary injunction\norder,” the District Court “assumed content neutrality”). That\nspecification is controlling. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 65(d)\n(requiring every injunction to “set forth the reasons for its\nissuance” and “be specific in terms”). See also Schmidt v. Lessard , 414 U. S. 473 , 476\n(1974) (per curiam) (Rule 65(d) “was designed to prevent\nuncertainty and confusion on the part of those faced with\ninjunctive orders.”). The final decision in Wyner’s case\nrejected the same claim she advanced in her preliminary injunction\nmotion: that the state law banning nudity in parks was\nunconstitutional as applied to expressive, nonerotic nudity. At the\nend of the fray, Florida’s Bathing Suit Rule remained intact, and\nWyner had gained no enduring “chang[e] [in] the legal relationship”\nbetween herself and the state officials she sued. See Texas\nState Teachers Assn. , 489 U. S., at 792. III Wyner is not a\nprevailing party, we conclude, for her initial victory was\nephemeral. A plaintiff who “secur[es] a preliminary injunction,\nthen loses on the merits as the case plays out and judgment is\nentered against [her],” has “[won] a battle but los[t] the war.” Watson v. County of Riverside , 300 F. 3d\n1092, 1096 (CA9 2002). We are presented with, and therefore decide,\nno broader issue in this case. We express no view on\nwhether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a\nclaim for permanent injunctive relief, success in gaining a\npreliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel\nfees. We decide only that a plaintiff who gains a preliminary\ninjunction does not qualify for an award of counsel fees under\n§1988(b) if the merits of the case are ultimately decided against\nher. *  *  * For the reasons\nstated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for proceedings consistent with this\nopinion. It is so ordered. Footnote 1 The rule reads: “In every area of\na park including bathing areas no individual shall expose the\nhuman, male or female genitals, pubic area, the entire buttocks or\nfemale breast below the top of the nipple, with less than a fully\nopaque covering.” Fla. Admin. Code Ann. §62D–2.014(7)(b)\n(2005). Footnote 2 Wyner was joined by coplaintiff\nGeorge Simon, who served as a videographer for expressive\nactivities Wyner previously organized at MacArthur Beach. See App.\n13. For convenience, we refer to the coplaintiffs collectively as\nWyner or plaintiff. Footnote 3 Buckhannon Board & Care\nHome, Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human\nResources , 532 U. S. 598 , 600 (2001), held that\nthe term “prevailing party” in the fee-shifting provisions of the\nFair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the Americans with\nDisabilities Act of 1990 does not “includ[e] a party that has\nfailed to secure a judgment on the merits or a court-ordered\nconsent decree, but has nonetheless achieved the desired result\nbecause the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the\ndefendant’s conduct.” The dissent in Buckhannon would have\ndeemed such a plaintiff “prevailing,” not because of any temporary relief gained (in that case, a consent stay\npending litigation), but because the lawsuit caused the State to\namend its laws, terminating the controversy between the parties,\nand permanently giving plaintiff the real-world outcome it\nsought. See id., at 622, 624–625 (opinion of Ginsburg,\nJ.). Our decision today is consistent with the views of both the\nmajority and the dissenters in Buckhannon . Footnote 4 In resolving Wyner’s claim for\ncounsel fees, we express no opinion on the dimensions of the First\nAmendment’s protection for artworks that involve nudity.",

MAX RETTELE et al. on petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit No. 06–605. Decided May 21, 2007 Per Curiam. Deputies of the Los Angeles\nCounty Sheriff’s Department obtained a valid warrant to search a\nhouse, but they were unaware that the suspects being sought had\nmoved out three months earlier. When the deputies searched the\nhouse, they found in a bedroom two residents who were of a\ndifferent race than the suspects. The deputies ordered these\ninnocent residents, who had been sleeping unclothed, out of bed.\nThe deputies required them to stand for a few minutes before\nallowing them to dress. The residents brought suit under Rev. Stat.\n§1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983, naming the deputies and other\nparties and accusing them of violating the Fourth Amendment right\nto be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The District\nCourt granted summary judgment to all named defendants. The Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, concluding both that the\ndeputies violated the Fourth Amendment and that they were not\nentitled to qualified immunity because a reasonable deputy would\nhave stopped the search upon discovering that respondents were of a\ndifferent race than the suspects and because a reasonable deputy\nwould not have ordered respondents from their bed. We grant the\npetition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals by this summary disposition. I From September to December 2001,\nLos Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Deputy Dennis Watters\ninvestigated a fraud and identity-theft crime ring. There were four\nsuspects of the investigation. One had registered a 9-millimeter\nGlock handgun. The four suspects were known to be\nAfrican-Americans. On December 11, Watters obtained\na search warrant for two houses in Lancaster, California, where he\nbelieved he could find the suspects. The warrant authorized him to\nsearch the homes and three of the suspects for documents and\ncomputer files. In support of the search warrant an affidavit cited\nvarious sources showing the suspects resided at respondents’ home.\nThe sources included Department of Motor Vehicles reports, mailing\naddress listings, an outstanding warrant, and an Internet telephone\ndirectory. In this Court respondents do not dispute the validity of\nthe warrant or the means by which it was obtained. What Watters did not know was that one of the\nhouses (the first to be searched) had been sold in September to a\nMax Rettele. He had purchased the home and moved into it three\nmonths earlier with his girlfriend Judy Sadler and Sadler’s\n17-year-old son Chase Hall. All three, respondents here, are\nCaucasians. On the morning of December 19, Watters briefed\nsix other deputies in preparation for the search of the houses.\nWatters informed them they would be searching for three\nAfrican-American suspects, one of whom owned a registered handgun.\nThe possibility a suspect would be armed caused the deputies\nconcern for their own safety. Watters had not obtained special\npermission for a night search, so he could not execute the warrant\nuntil 7 a.m. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. §1533 (West 2000). Around\n7:15 Watters and six other deputies knocked on the door and\nannounced their presence. Chase Hall answered. The deputies entered\nthe house after ordering Hall to lie face down on the ground. The deputies’ announcement awoke Rettele and\nSadler. The deputies entered their bedroom with guns drawn and\nordered them to get out of their bed and to show their hands. They\nprotested that they were not wearing clothes. Rettele stood up and\nattempted to put on a pair of sweatpants, but deputies told him not\nto move. Sadler also stood up and attempted, without success, to\ncover herself with a sheet. Rettele and Sadler were held at\ngunpoint for one to two minutes before Rettele was allowed to\nretrieve a robe for Sadler. He was then permitted to dress. Rettele\nand Sadler left the bedroom within three to four minutes to sit on\nthe couch in the living room. By that time the deputies realized they had\nmade a mistake. They apologized to Rettele and Sadler, thanked them\nfor not becoming upset, and left within five minutes. They\nproceeded to the other house the warrant authorized them to search,\nwhere they found three suspects. Those suspects were arrested and\nconvicted. Rettele and Sadler, individually and as\nguardians ad litem for Hall, filed this §1983 suit against Los\nAngeles County, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, Deputy\nWatters, and other members of the sheriff’s department. Respondents\nalleged petitioners violated their Fourth Amendment rights by\nobtaining a warrant in reckless fashion and conducting an\nunreasonable search and detention. The District Court held that the\nwarrant was obtained by proper procedures and the search was\nreasonable. It concluded in the alternative that any Fourth\nAmendment rights the deputies violated were not clearly established\nand that, as a result, the deputies were entitled to qualified\nimmunity. On appeal respondents did not challenge the\nvalidity of the warrant; they did argue that the deputies had\nconducted the search in an unreasonable manner. A divided panel of\nthe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in an\nunpublished opinion. 186 Fed. Appx. 765 (2006). The majority held\nthat “because (1) no African-Americans lived in\n[respondents’] home; (2) [respondents], a Caucasian couple,\npurchased the residence several months before the search and the\ndeputies did not conduct an ownership inquiry; (3) the\nAfrican-American suspects were not accused of a crime that required\nan emergency search; and (4) [respondents] were ordered out of bed\nnaked and held at gunpoint while the deputies searched their\nbedroom for the suspects and a gun, we find that a reasonable jury\ncould conclude that the search and detention were ‘unnecessarily\npainful, degrading, or prolonged,’ and involved ‘an undue invasion\nof privacy,’ Franklin v. Foxworth , 31\nF. 3d 873, 876 (9th Cir. 1994).” Id., at 766. Turning to whether respondents’ Fourth Amendment\nrights were clearly established, the majority held that a\nreasonable deputy should have known the search and detention were\nunlawful. Judge Cowen dissented. In his view the\ndeputies had authority to detain respondents for the duration of\nthe search and were justified in ordering respondents from their\nbed because weapons could have been concealed under the bedcovers.\nHe also concluded that, assuming a constitutional violation, the\nlaw was not clearly established. The Court of Appeals denied rehearing and\nrehearing en banc. II Because respondents were of a\ndifferent race than the suspects the deputies were seeking, the\nCourt of Appeals held that “[a]fter taking one look at\n[respondents], the deputies should have realized that [respondents]\nwere not the subjects of the search warrant and did not pose a\nthreat to the deputies’ safety.” Ibid. We need not pause\nlong in rejecting this unsound proposition. When the deputies\nordered respondents from their bed, they had no way of knowing\nwhether the African-American suspects were elsewhere in the house.\nThe presence of some Caucasians in the residence did not eliminate\nthe possibility that the suspects lived there as well. As the\ndeputies stated in their affidavits, it is not uncommon in our\nsociety for people of different races to live together. Just as\npeople of different races live and work together, so too might they\nengage in joint criminal activity. The deputies, who were searching\na house where they believed a suspect might be armed, possessed\nauthority to secure the premises before deciding whether to\ncontinue with the search. In Michigan v. Summers , 452 U. S. 692 (1981),\nthis Court held that officers executing a search warrant for\ncontraband may “detain the occupants of the premises while a proper\nsearch is conducted.” Id., at 705. In weighing whether the\nsearch in Summers was reasonable the Court first found\nthat “detention represents only an incremental intrusion on\npersonal liberty when the search of a home has been authorized by a\nvalid warrant.” Id. , at 703. Against that interest, it\nbalanced “preventing flight in the event that incriminating\nevidence is found”; “minimizing the risk of harm to the officers”;\nand facilitating “the orderly completion of the search.” Id., at 702–703; see Muehler v. Mena , 544 U. S. 93 (2005). In executing a search warrant officers may\ntake reasonable action to secure the premises and to ensure their\nown safety and the efficacy of the search. Id., at 98–100;\nsee also id., at 103 (Kennedy, J., concurring); Summers , supra , at 704–705. The test of\nreasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is an objective one. Graham v. Connor , 490 U. S. 386 , 397\n(1989) (addressing the reasonableness of a seizure of the person).\nUnreasonable actions include the use of excessive force or\nrestraints that cause unnecessary pain or are imposed for a\nprolonged and unnecessary period of time. Mena , supra , at 100; Graham , supra , at\n396–399. The orders by the police to the occupants, in\nthe context of this lawful search, were permissible, and perhaps\nnecessary, to protect the safety of the deputies. Blankets and\nbedding can conceal a weapon, and one of the suspects was known to\nown a firearm, factors which underscore this point. The\nConstitution does not require an officer to ignore the possibility\nthat an armed suspect may sleep with a weapon within reach. The\nreports are replete with accounts of suspects sleeping close to\nweapons. See United States v. Enslin , 327\nF. 3d 788, 791 (CA9 2003) (“When [the suspect] put his hands\nin the air and began to sit up, his movement shifted the covers and\nthe marshals could see a gun in the bed next to him”); see also United States v. Jones , 336 F. 3d 245, 248\n(CA3 2003) (suspect kept a 9-millimeter Luger under his pillow\nwhile he slept); United States v. Hightower , 96\nF. 3d 211 (CA7 1996) (suspect kept a loaded five-shot handgun\nunder his pillow); State v. Willis , 36,759–KA,\np. 3 (La. App. 4/9/03), 843 So. 2d 592, 595 (officers\n“pulled back the bed covers and found a .38 caliber Model 10 Smith\nand Wesson revolver located near where defendant’s left hand had\nbeen”); State v. Kypreos , 115 Wash. App. 207, 61\nP. 3d 352 (2002) (suspect kept a handgun in the bed). The deputies needed a moment to secure the\nroom and ensure that other persons were not close by or did not\npresent a danger. Deputies were not required to turn their backs to\nallow Rettele and Sadler to retrieve clothing or to cover\nthemselves with the sheets. Rather, “[t]he risk of harm to both the\npolice and the occupants is minimized if the officers routinely\nexercise unquestioned command of the situation.” Summers ,\n452 U. S., at 702–703. This is not to say, of course, that the\ndeputies were free to force Rettele and Sadler to remain motionless\nand standing for any longer than necessary. We have recognized that\n“special circumstances, or possibly a prolonged detention” might\nrender a search unreasonable. See id., at 705, n. 21.\nThere is no accusation that the detention here was prolonged. The\ndeputies left the home less than 15 minutes after arriving. The\ndetention was shorter and less restrictive than the 2- to 3-hour\nhandcuff detention upheld in Mena . See 544 U. S., at 100.\nAnd there is no allegation that the deputies prevented Sadler and\nRettele from dressing longer than necessary to protect their\nsafety. Sadler was unclothed for no more than two minutes, and\nRettele for only slightly more time than that. Sadler testified\nthat once the police were satisfied that no immediate threat was\npresented, “they wanted us to get dressed and they were pressing us\nreally fast to hurry up and get some clothes on.” Deposition of\nJudy Lorraine Sadler in No. CV–0206262–RSWL (RNBX) (CD Cal., June\n10, 2003), Doc. 26, Exh. 4, p. 55. The Fourth Amendment allows warrants to issue\non probable cause, a standard well short of absolute certainty.\nValid warrants will issue to search the innocent, and people like\nRettele and Sadler unfortunately bear the cost. Officers executing\nsearch warrants on occasion enter a house when residents are\nengaged in private activity; and the resulting frustration,\nembarrassment, and humiliation may be real, as was true here. When\nofficers execute a valid warrant and act in a reasonable manner to\nprotect themselves from harm, however, the Fourth Amendment is not\nviolated. As respondents’ constitutional rights were not\nviolated, “there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning\nqualified immunity.” Saucier v. Katz , 533 U. S. 194 , 201\n(2001). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion. It is so ordered. Justice Souter would deny the\npetition for a writ of certiorari.",

    "fulltext": "SYLLABUS OCTOBER TERM, 2007 DAVIS V. FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES DAVIS v . FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION appeal from the united states district court for\nthe district of columbia No. 07–320. Argued April 22, 2008—Decided June 26,\n2008 Federal-law limits on the amount of contributions a\nHouse of Representatives candidate and his authorized committee may\nreceive from an individual, and the amount his party may devote to\ncoordinated campaign expenditures, 2 U. S. C. §§441a(a)(1)(A),\n(a)(3)(A), (c), and (d), normally apply equally to all competitors\nfor a seat and their authorized committees. However, §319(a) of the\nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 2 U. S. C.\n§441a–1(a), part of the so-called “Millionaire’s Amendment,”\nfundamentally alters this scheme when, as a result of a candidate’s\nexpenditure of personal funds, the “opposition personal funds\namount” (OPFA) exceeds $350,000. The OPFA is a statistic comparing\ncompeting candidates’ personal expenditures and taking account of\ncertain other fundraising. When a “self-financing” candidate’s\npersonal expenditure causes the OPFA to pass $350,000, a new,\nasymmetrical regulatory scheme comes into play. The self-financing\ncandidate remains subject to the normal limitations, but his\nopponent, the “non-self-financing” candidate, may receive\nindividual contributions at treble the normal limit from\nindividuals who have reached the normal limit on aggregate\ncontributions, and may accept coordinated party expenditures\nwithout limit. See §§441a–1(a)(1)(A)–(C). Because calculating the\nOPFA requires certain information about the self-financing\ncandidate’s campaign assets and personal expenditures, §319(b)\nrequires him to file an initial “declaration of intent” revealing\nthe amount of personal funds the candidate intends to spend in\nexcess of $350,000, and to make additional disclosures to the other\ncandidates, their national parties, and the Federal Election\nCommission (FEC) as his personal expenditures exceed certain\nbenchmarks. Appellant Davis, a candidate\nfor a House seat in 2004 and 2006 who lost both times to the\nincumbent, notified the FEC for the 2006 election, in compliance\nwith §319(b), that he intended to spend $1 million in personal\nfunds. After the FEC informed him it had reason to believe he had\nviolated §319 by failing to report personal expenditures during the\n2004 campaign, he filed this suit for a declaration that §319 is\nunconstitutional and an injunction preventing the FEC from\nenforcing the section during the 2006 election. The District Court\nconcluded sU. S.onte that Davis had standing, but rejected\nhis claims on the merits and granted the FEC summary judgment. Held: 1. This Court has\njurisdiction to hear Davis’ appeal. Pp. 6–10. (a) Davis has\nstanding to challenge §319(b)’s disclosure requirements. When he\nfiled suit, he had already declared his 2006 candidacy and had been\nforced by §319(b) to disclose to his opponent that he intended to\nspend more than $350,000 in personal funds. He also faced the\nimminent threat that he would have to follow up on that disclosure\nwith further notifications once he passed the $350,000 mark.\nSecuring a declaration that §319(b) is unconstitutional and an\ninjunction against its enforcement would have spared him from\nmaking those disclosures and also would have removed the real\nthreat that the FEC would pursue an enforcement action based on\nalleged §319(b) violations during his 2004 campaign. Davis also has\nstanding to challenge §319(a)’s asymmetrical contribution limits.\nThe standing inquiry focuses on whether the party invoking\njurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit\nwas filed, see, e.g., Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc. , 528 U. S. 167 , 180, and\na party facing prospective injury has standing where the threatened\ninjury is real, immediate, and direct, see, e.g., Los\nAngeles v. Lyons , 461 U. S. 95 , 102. Davis\nfaced the requisite injury from §319(a) when he filed suit: He had\nalready declared his candidacy and his intent to spend more than\n$350,000 of personal funds in the general election campaign whose\nonset was rapidly approaching. Section 319(a) would shortly burden\nhis personal expenditure by allowing his opponent to receive\ncontributions on more favorable terms, and there was no indication\nthat his opponent would forgo that opportunity. Pp. 6–8. (b) The FEC’s argument\nthat the Court lacks jurisdiction because Davis’ claims are moot\nalso fails. In Federal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin\nRight to Life, Inc. (WRTL) , 551 U. S. ___, this Court rejected\na very similar claim of mootness, finding that the case “fit\ncomfortably within the established exception to mootness for\ndisputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.” Id., at ___. That “exception applies where ‘(1) the challenged action is\nin its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation\nor expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the\nsame complaining party will be subject to the same action\nagain.’ ” Ibid. First, despite BCRA’s command that\nthe case be expedited to the greatest possible extent and Davis’\nrequest that his case be resolved before the 2006 election, the\ncase could not be resolved before the 2006 election. See id., at ___. Second, the FEC has conceded that Davis’\n§319(a) claim would be capable of repetition if he planned to\nself-finance another bid for a House seat, and he subsequently made\na public statement expressing his intent to do so. See id., at ___ . Pp. 8–9. 2. Sections 319(a) and (b) violate the\nFirst Amendment. If §319(a)’s elevated contribution limits applied\nacross the board to all candidates, Davis would have no\nconstitutional basis for challenging them. Section 319(a), however,\nraises the limits only for non-self-financing candidates and only\nwhen the self-financing candidate’s expenditure of personal funds\ncauses the OPFA threshold to be exceeded. This Court has never\nupheld the constitutionality of a law that imposes different\ncontribution limits for candidates competing against each other,\nand it agrees with Davis that this scheme impermissibly burdens his\nFirst Amendment right to spend his own money for campaign speech.\nIn Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U. S. 1 , the Court\nsoundly rejected a cap on a candidate’s expenditure of personal\nfunds to finance campaign speech, holding that a “candidate … has a\nFirst Amendment right to … vigorously and tirelessly … advocate his\nown election,” and that a cap on personal expenditures imposes “a\nsubstantial,” “clea[r,]” and “direc[t]” restraint on that right, id., at 52–53. It found the cap at issue not justified by\n“[t]he primary governmental interest” in “the prevention of actual\nand apparent corruption of the political process,” id., at\n53, or by “[t]he ancillary interest in equalizing the relative\nfinancial resources of candidates competing for elective office,” id., at 54. Buckley is instructive here. While\nBCRA does not impose a cap on a candidate’s expenditure of personal\nfunds, it imposes an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who\nrobustly exercises that First Amendment right, requiring him to\nchoose between the right to engage in unfettered political speech\nand subjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations. The\nresulting drag on First Amendment rights is not constitutional\nsimply because it attaches as a consequence of a statutorily\nimposed choice. Id., at 54–57, and n. 65, distinguished.\nThe burden is not justified by any governmental interest in\neliminating corruption or the perception of corruption, see id., at 53. Nor can an interest in leveling electoral\nopportunities for candidates of different personal wealth justify\n§319(a)’s asymmetrical limits, see id., at 56–57. The\nCourt has never recognized this interest as a legitimate objective\nand doing so would have ominous implications for the voters’\nauthority to evaluate the strengths of candidates competing for\noffice. Finally, the Court rejects the Government’s argument that\n§319(a) is justified because it ameliorates the deleterious effects\nresulting from the tight limits federal election law places on\nindividual campaign contributions and coordinated party\nexpenditures. Whatever this argument’s merits as an original\nmatter, it is fundamentally at war with Buckley ’s analysis\nof expenditure and contributions limits, which this Court has\napplied in subsequent cases. Pp. 10–17. (c) Because §319(a) is\nunconstitutional, §319(b)’s disclosure requirements, which were\ndesigned to implement the asymmetrical contribution limits, are as\nwell. “[C]ompelled disclosure, in itself, can seriously infringe on\nprivacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First\nAmendment,” Buckley, 424 U. S., at 64, so the Court\nclosely scrutinizes such requirements, id., at 75. For\nsignificant encroachments to survive, there must be “a ‘relevant\ncorrelation’ or ‘substantial relation’ between the governmental\ninterest and the information required to be disclosed” and the\ngovernmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the burden on\nFirst Amendment rights. Ibid . Given §319(a)’s\nunconstitutionality, the burden imposed by the §319(b) requirements\ncannot be justified. P. 18. 501 F. Supp. 2d 22, reversed and remanded.

S. ____ (2008) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 07-320 JACK DAVIS, APPELLANT v. FEDERAL ELECTION\nCOMMISSION on appeal from the united states district court for\nthe district of columbia [June 26, 2008] Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court in which Justice Stevens, Justice Souter,\nJustice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer joined as to Part II. In this appeal, we consider the\nconstitutionality of federal election law provisions that, under\ncertain circumstances, impose different campaign contribution\nlimits on candidates competing for the same congressional seat. I A Federal law limits the amount of\nmoney that a candidate for the House of Representatives and the\ncandidate’s authorized committee may receive from an individual, as\nwell as the amount that the candidate’s party may devote to\ncoordinated campaign expenditures. 2 U. S. C. §441a (2006\ned.).[ Footnote 1 ] Under the\nusual circumstances, the same restrictions apply to all the\ncompetitors for a seat and their authorized committees.\nContributions from individual donors during a 2-year election cycle\nare subject to a cap, which is currently set at $2,300. See\n§§441a(a)(1)(A), (c); 72 Fed. Reg. 5295 (2007). In addition, no\nfunds may be accepted from an individual whose aggregate\ncontributions to candidates and their committees during the\nelection cycle have reached the legal limit, currently $42,700. See\n2 U. S. C. §§441a(a)(3)(A), (c); 72 Fed. Reg. 5295. A\ncandidate also may not accept general election coordinated\nexpenditures by national or state political party committees that\nexceed an imposed limit. See 2 U. S. C. §§441a(c), (d).\nCurrently, the limit for candidates in States with more than one\nHouse seat is $40,900. 72 Fed. Reg. 5294.[ Footnote 2 ] Section 319(a) of the Bipartisan\nCampaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), 116 Stat. 109, 2 U. S. C.\n§441a–1(a),[ Footnote 3 ] part of\nthe so-called “Millionaire’s Amendment,” fundamentally alters this\nscheme when, as a result of a candidate’s expenditure of personal\nfunds, the “opposition personal funds amount” (OPFA) exceeds\n$350,000.[ Footnote 4 ] The OPFA,\nin simple terms, is a statistic that compares the expenditure of\npersonal funds by competing candidates and also takes into account\nto some degree certain other fundraising.[ Footnote 5 ] See §441a–1(a). When a candidate’s\nexpenditure of personal funds causes the OPFA to pass the $350,000\nmark (for convenience, such candidates will be referred to as\n“self-financing”), a new, asymmetrical regulatory scheme comes into\nplay. The self-financing candidate remains subject to the\nlimitations noted above, but the candidate’s opponent (the\n“non-self-financing” candidate) may receive individual\ncontributions at treble the normal limit (e.g., $6,900\nrather than the current $2,300), even from individuals who have\nreached the normal aggregate contributions cap, and may accept\ncoordinated party expenditures without limit. See\n§§441a–1(a)(1)(A)–(C). Once the non-self-financing candidate’s\nreceipts exceed the OPFA, the prior limits are revived.\n§441a–1(a)(3). A candidate who does not spend the contributions\nreceived under the asymmetrical limits must return them.\n§441a–1(a)(4). In order to calculate the OPFA, certain\ninformation is needed about the self-financing candidate’s campaign\nassets and personal expenditures. Section 319(b) thus requires\nself-financing candidates to make three types of disclosures.\nFirst, within 15 days after entering a race, a candidate must file\na “[d]eclaration of intent” revealing the amount of personal funds\nthe candidate intends to spend in excess of $350,000. 2 U.\nS. C. §441a–1(b)(1)(B). A candidate who does not intend to\ncross this threshold may simply declare an intent to spend no\npersonal funds. 11 CFR §400.20(a)(2) (2008). Second, within 24\nhours of crossing or becoming obligated to cross the $350,000 mark,\nthe candidate must file an “[i]nitial notification.” 2 U.\nS. C. §441a–1(b)(1)(C). Third, the candidate must file an\n“[a]dditional notification” within 24 hours of making or becoming\nobligated to make each additional expenditure of $10,000 or more\nusing personal funds. §441a–1(b)(1)(D). The initial and additional\nnotifications must provide the date and amount of each expenditure\nfrom personal funds, and all notifications must be filed with the\nFederal Election Commission (FEC), all other candidates for the\nseat, and the national parties of all those candidates.\n§441a–1(b)(1)(E). Failure to comply with the reporting requirements\nmay result in civil and criminal penalties. §§437g(a)(5)–(6),\n(d)(1). A non-self-financing candidate and the\ncandidate’s committee face less extensive disclosure requirements.\nWithin 24 hours after receiving an “initial” or “additional”\nnotification filed by a self-financing opponent, a\nnon-self-financing candidate must provide notice to the FEC and the\nnational and state committees of the candidate’s party if the\nnon-self-financing candidate concludes based on the newly acquired\ninformation that the OPFA has passed the $350,000 mark. 11 CFR\n§400.30(b)(2). In addition, when the additional contributions that\na non-self-financing candidate is authorized to receive pursuant to\nthe asymmetrical limitations scheme equals the OPFA, the\nnon-self-financing candidate must notify the FEC and the\nappropriate national and state committees within 24 hours.\n§400.31(e)(1)(ii). The non-self-financing candidate must also\nprovide notice regarding any refunds of “excess funds” (funds\nreceived under the increased limits but not used in the campaign).\n§§400.50, 400.54. For their part, political parties must notify the\nFEC and the candidate they support within 24 hours of making any\nexpenditures that exceed the normal limit for coordinated party\nexpenditures. §400.30(c)(2). B Appellant Jack Davis was the\nDemocratic candidate for the House of Representatives from New\nYork’s 26th Congressional District in 2004 and 2006. In both\nelections, he lost to the incumbent. In his brief, Davis discloses\nhaving spent $1.2 million, principally his own funds, on his 2004\ncampaign. Brief for Appellant 4. He reports spending $2.3 million\nin 2006, all but $126,000 of which came from personal funds. Id. , at 13. His opponent in 2006 spent no personal funds.\nIndeed, although the OPFA calculation provided the opportunity for\nDavis’ opponent to raise nearly $1.5 million under §319(a)’s\nasymmetrical limits, Davis’ opponent adhered to the normal\ncontribution limits. Davis’ 2006 candidacy began in\nMarch 2006, when he filed with the FEC a “Statement of Candidacy”\nand, in compliance with §319(b), declared that he intended to spend\n$1 million in personal funds during the general election. Two\nmonths later, in anticipation of this expenditure and its §319\nconsequences, Davis filed suit against the FEC, requesting that\n§319 be declared unconstitutional and that the FEC be enjoined from\nenforcing it during the 2006 election. After Davis declared his candidacy but before\nhe filed suit, the FEC’s general counsel notified him that it had\nreason to believe that he had violated §319 by failing to report\npersonal expenditures during the 2004 campaign. The FEC proposed a\nconciliation agreement under which Davis would pay a substantial\ncivil penalty. Davis responded by agreeing to toll the limitations\nperiod for an FEC enforcement action until resolution of this\nsuit. Davis filed this action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, and a three-judge\npanel was convened. BCRA §403, 116 Stat. 113, note following 2 U.\nS. C. §437h. While Davis requested that the case be decided\nbefore the general election campaign began on September 12, 2006,\nthe FEC opposed the request, asserting the need for extensive\ndiscovery, and the request was denied. Ultimately, the parties\nfiled cross-motions for summary judgment. Ruling on those motions, the District Court\nbegan by addressing Davis’ standing sua sponte . The Court\nconcluded that Davis had standing, but rejected his claims on the\nmerits and granted summary judgment for the FEC. 501 F. Supp.\n2d 22 (2007). Davis then invoked BCRA’s exclusive avenue for\nappellate review—direct appeal to this Court. Note following §437h.\nWe deferred full consideration of our jurisdiction, 552 U. S. ___\n(2008), and we now reverse. II Like the District Court, we must\nfirst ensure that we have jurisdiction to hear Davis’ appeal.\nArticle III restricts federal courts to the resolution of cases and\ncontroversies. Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona , 520\nU. S. 43 , 64 (1997). That restriction requires that the party\ninvoking federal jurisdiction have standing—the “personal interest\nthat must exist at the commencement of the litigation.” Friends\nof Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC),\nInc. , 528 U. S.\n167 , 189 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). But it is\nnot enough that the requisite interest exist at the outset. “To\nqualify as a case fit for federal-court adjudication, ‘an actual\ncontroversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at\nthe time the complaint is filed.’ ” Arizonans for Official\nEnglish, supra, at 67. The FEC argues that Davis’ appeal fails\nto present a constitutional case or controversy because Davis lacks\nstanding and because his claims are moot. We address each of these\nissues in turn. A As noted, the requirement that a\nclaimant have “standing is an essential and unchanging part of the\ncase-or-controversy requirement of Article III.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U. S. 555 , 560\n(1992); see also Arizonans for Official English, supra, at\n64. To qualify for standing, a claimant must present an injury that\nis concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly\ntraceable to the defendant’s challenged behavior; and likely to be\nredressed by a favorable ruling. Lujan, supra, at\n560–561. The District Court held, and the\nparties do not dispute, that Davis possesses standing to challenge\nthe disclosure requirements of §319(b). When Davis filed suit, he\nhad already declared his 2006 candidacy and had been forced by\n§319(b) to disclose to his opponent that he intended to spend more\nthan $350,000 in personal funds. At that time, Davis faced the\nimminent threat that he would have to follow up on that disclosure\nwith further notifications after he in fact passed the $350,000\nmark. Securing a declaration that §319(b)’s requirements are\nunconstitutional and an injunction against their enforcement would\nhave spared him from making those disclosures. That relief also\nwould have removed the real threat that the FEC would pursue an\nenforcement action based on alleged violations of §319(b) during\nhis 2004 campaign. As a result, Davis possesses standing to\nchallenge §319(b)’s disclosure requirement. The fact that Davis has standing to challenge\n§319(b) does not necessarily mean that he also has standing to\nchallenge the scheme of contribution limitations that applies when\n§319(a) comes into play. “[S]tanding is not dispensed in gross.” Lewis v. Casey , 518 U. S. 343 , 358,\nn. 6 (1996). Rather, “a plaintiff must demonstrate standing\nfor each claim he seeks to press” and “ ‘for each form of\nrelief’ ” that is sought. DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno , 547\nU. S. 332 , 352 (2006) (quoting Friends of Earth,\nsupra, at 185). In light of these principles, the FEC argues\nthat Davis lacks standing to attack §319(a)’s asymmetrical limits.\nWhen Davis commenced this action, his opponent had not yet\nqualified for the asymmetrical limits, and later, when his opponent\ndid qualify to take advantage of those limits, he chose not to do\nso. Accordingly, the FEC argues that §319(a) did not cause Davis\nany injury. While the proof required to establish standing\nincreases as the suit proceeds, see Lujan, supra, at 561,\nthe standing inquiry remains focused on whether the party invoking\njurisdiction had the requisite stake in the outcome when the suit\nwas filed. Friends of Earth , supra, at 180; Arizonans for Official English , supra, at 68, n.\n22. As noted above, the injury required for standing need not be\nactualized. A party facing prospective injury has standing to sue\nwhere the threatened injury is real, immediate, and direct. Los\nAngeles v. Lyons , 461 U. S. 95 , 102 (1983);\nsee also Babbitt v. Farm Workers , 442 U. S. 289 , 298\n(1979) (A plaintiff may challenge the prospective operation of a\nstatute that presents a realistic and impending threat of direct\ninjury). Davis faced such an injury from the operation of §319(a)\nwhen he filed suit. Davis had declared his candidacy and his intent\nto spend more than $350,000 of personal funds in the general\nelection campaign whose onset was rapidly approaching. Section\n319(a) would shortly burden his expenditure of personal funds by\nallowing his opponent to receive contributions on more favorable\nterms, and there was no indication that his opponent would forgo\nthat opportunity. Indeed, the record at summary judgment indicated\nthat most candidates who had the opportunity to receive expanded\ncontributions had done so. App. 89. In these circumstances, we\nconclude that Davis faced the requisite injury from §319(a) when he\nfiled suit and has standing to challenge that provision’s\nasymmetrical contribution scheme. B The FEC’s mootness argument also\nfails. This case closely resembles Federal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. , 551 U. S. ___ (2007).\nThere, Wisconsin Right to Life (WRTL), a nonprofit, ideological\nadvocacy corporation, wished to run radio and TV ads within 30 days\nof the 2004 Washington primary, contrary to a restriction imposed\nby BCRA. WRTL sued the FEC, seeking declaratory and injunctive\nrelief. Although the suit was not resolved before the 2004\nelection, we rejected the FEC’s claim of mootness, finding that the\ncase “fit comfortably within the established exception to mootness\nfor disputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8). That “exception applies\nwhere ‘(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be\nfully litigated prior to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is\na reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be\nsubject to the same action again.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Spencer v. Kemna , 523 U. S. 1 , 17\n(1998)). In WRTL , “despite BCRA’s\ncommand that the cas[e] be expedited ‘to the greatest possible\nextent,’ ” WRTL’s claims could not reasonably be resolved\nbefore the election concluded. 551 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8)\n(quoting §403(a)(4), 116 Stat. 113, note following 2 U. S. C.\n§437h). Similarly, in this case despite BCRA’s mandate to expedite\nand Davis’ request that his case be resolved before the 2004\ngeneral election season commenced, Davis’ case could not be\nresolved before the 2006 election concluded, demonstrating that his\nclaims are capable of evading review. As to the second prong of the exception, even\nthough WRTL raised an as-applied challenge, we found its suit\ncapable of repetition where “WRTL credibly claimed that it planned\non running ‘materially similar’ future” ads subject to BCRA’s\nprohibition and had, in fact, sought an injunction that would\npermit such an ad during the 2006 election. 551 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 9) (some internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the FEC\nconceded in its brief that Davis’ §319(a) claim would be capable of\nrepetition if Davis planned to self-finance another bid for a House\nseat. Brief for Appellee 14, 20–21, and n. 5. Davis\nsubsequently made a public statement expressing his intent to do\nso. See Reply Brief 16 (citing Terreri, Democrat Davis Confirms\nHe’ll Run Again for Congress, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle,\nMar. 27, 2008, p. 5B). As a result, we are satisfied that\nDavis’ facial challenge is not moot.[ Footnote 6 ] III We turn to the merits of Davis’\nclaim that the First Amendment is violated by the contribution\nlimits that apply when §319(a) comes into play. Under this scheme,\nas previously noted, when a candidate spends more than $350,000 in\npersonal funds and creates what the statute apparently regards as a\nfinancial imbalance, that candidate’s opponent may qualify to\nreceive both larger individual contributions than would otherwise\nbe allowed and unlimited coordinated party expenditures. Davis\ncontends that §319(a) unconstitutionally burdens his exercise of\nhis First Amendment right to make unlimited expenditures of his\npersonal funds because making expenditures that create the\nimbalance has the effect of enabling his opponent to raise more\nmoney and to use that money to finance speech that counteracts and\nthus diminishes the effectiveness of Davis’ own speech. A If §319(a) simply raised the\ncontribution limits for all candidates, Davis’ argument would\nplainly fail. This Court has previously sustained the facial\nconstitutionality of limits on discrete and aggregate individual\ncontributions and on coordinated party expenditures. Buckley v. Valeo , 424 U. S. 1 , 23–35, 38,\n46–47, and n. 53 (1976) (per curiam); Federal\nElection Comm’n v. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign\nComm. , 533 U.\nS. 431 , 437, 465 (2001) (Colorado II) . At the same\ntime, the Court has recognized that such limits implicate First\nAmendment interests and that they cannot stand unless they are\n“closely drawn” to serve a “sufficiently important interest,” such\nas preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption. See, e.g., McConnell v. Federal Election\nComm’n, 540 U. S. 93 , 136, 138, n. 40\n(2003); Colorado II, supra, at 456; Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC , 528 U. S. 377 , 387–388\n(2000); Buckley, supra, at 25–30, 38. When contribution\nlimits are challenged as too restrictive, we have extended a\nmeasure of deference to the judgment of the legislative body that\nenacted the law. See, e.g., Randall v. Sorrell , 548 U. S. 230 , 248\n(2006) (plurality opinion); Nixon, supra, at 396–397; Buckley, supra, at 30, 111, 103–104. But we have held that\nlimits that are too low cannot stand. Randall, supra, at\n246–262; id ., at 263 (Alito, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in judgment). There is, however, no\nconstitutional basis for attacking contribution limits on the\nground that they are too high. Congress has no constitutional\nobligation to limit contributions at all; and if Congress concludes\nthat allowing contributions of a certain amount does not create an\nundue risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption, a\ncandidate who wishes to restrict an opponent’s fundraising cannot\nargue that the Constitution demands that contributions be regulated\nmore strictly. Consequently, if §319(a)’s elevated contribution\nlimits applied across the board, Davis would not have any basis for\nchallenging those limits. B Section 319(a), however, does not\nraise the contribution limits across the board. Rather, it raises\nthe limits only for the non-self-financing candidate and does so\nonly when the self-financing candidate’s expenditure of personal\nfunds causes the OPFA threshold to be exceeded. We have never\nupheld the constitutionality of a law that imposes different\ncontribution limits for candidates who are competing against each\nother, and we agree with Davis that this scheme impermissibly\nburdens his First Amendment right to spend his own money for\ncampaign speech. In Buckley , we soundly\nrejected a cap on a candidate’s expenditure of personal funds to\nfinance campaign speech. We held that a “candidate … has a First\nAmendment right to engage in the discussion of public issues and\nvigorously and tirelessly to advocate his own election” and that a\ncap on personal expenditures imposes “a substantial,” “clea[r]” and\n“direc[t]” restraint on that right. 424 U. S., at 52–53. We found\nthat the cap at issue was not justified by “[t]he primary\ngovernmental interest” proffered in its defense, i.e. ,\n“the prevention of actual and apparent corruption of the political\nprocess.” Id., at 53. Far from preventing these evils,\n“the use of personal funds,” we observed, “reduces the candidate’s\ndependence on outside contributions and thereby counteracts the\ncoercive pressures and attendant risks of abuse to which …\ncontribution limitations are directed.” Ibid. We also\nrejected the argument that the expenditure cap could be justified\non the ground that it served “[t]he ancillary interest in\nequalizing the relative financial resources of candidates competing\nfor elective office.” Id., at 54. This putative interest,\nwe noted, was “clearly not sufficient to justify the … infringement\nof fundamental First Amendment rights.” Ibid. Buckley ’s emphasis on the fundamental\nnature of the right to spend personal funds for campaign speech is\ninstructive. While BCRA does not impose a cap on a candidate’s\nexpenditure of personal funds, it imposes an unprecedented penalty\non any candidate who robustly exercises that First Amendment right.\nSection 319(a) requires a candidate to choose between the First\nAmendment right to engage in unfettered political speech and\nsubjection to discriminatory fundraising limitations. Many\ncandidates who can afford to make large personal expenditures to\nsupport their campaigns may choose to do so despite §319(a), but\nthey must shoulder a special and potentially significant burden if\nthey make that choice. See Day v. Holahan , 34\nF. 3d 1356, 1359–1360 (CA8 1994) (concluding that a Minnesota\nlaw that increased a candidate’s expenditure limits and eligibility\nfor public funds based on independent expenditures against her\ncandidacy burdened the speech of those making the independent\nexpenditures); Brief for Appellee 29 (conceding that “[§]319 does\nimpose some consequences on a candidate’s choice to self-finance\nbeyond certain amounts”). Under §319(a), the vigorous exercise of\nthe right to use personal funds to finance campaign speech produces\nfundraising advantages for opponents in the competitive context of\nelectoral politics. Cf. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. Public Util. Comm’n of Cal. , 475 U. S. 1 , 14 (1986)\n(plurality opinion) (finding infringement on speech rights where if\nthe plaintiff spoke it could “be forced … to help disseminate\nhostile views”). The resulting drag on First Amendment rights\nis not constitutional simply because it attaches as a consequence\nof a statutorily imposed choice. In Buckley , we held that\nCongress “may engage in public financing of election campaigns and\nmay condition acceptance of public funds on an agreement by the\ncandidate to abide by specified expenditure limitations” even\nthough we found an independent limit on overall campaign\nexpenditures to be unconstitutional. 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65; see id., at 54–58. But the choice involved in Buckley was quite different from the choice imposed by §319(a). In Buckley, a candidate, by forgoing public financing, could\nretain the unfettered right to make unlimited personal\nexpenditures. Here, §319(a) does not provide any way in which a\ncandidate can exercise that right without abridgment. Instead, a\ncandidate who wishes to exercise that right has two choices: abide\nby a limit on personal expenditures or end",

    "fulltext": "SYLLABUS OCTOBER TERM, 2007 CBOCS WEST, INC. V. HUMPHRIES SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES CBOCS WEST, INC. v . HUMPHRIES certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the seventh circuit No. 06–1431. Argued February 20, 2008—Decided May\n27, 2008 Claiming that petitioner CBOCS West, Inc.,\ndismissed him because he is black and because he complained to\nmanagers that a black co-employee was also dismissed for race-based\nreasons, respondent Humphries filed suit charging that CBOCS’\nactions violated both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and\n42 U. S. C. §1981, the latter of which gives “[a]ll persons …\nthe same right … to make and enforce contracts … as is enjoyed by\nwhite citizens.” The District Court dismissed the Title VII claims\nfor failure to timely pay filing fees and granted CBOCS summary\njudgment on the §1981 claims. The Seventh Circuit affirmed on the\ndirect discrimination claim, but remanded for a trial on Humphries’\n§1981 retaliation claim, rejecting CBOCS’ argument that §1981 did\nnot encompass such a claim. Held: Section 1981 encompasses\nretaliation claims. Pp. 2–14. (a) Because this conclusion\nrests in significant part upon stare decisis principles , the Court examines the pertinent interpretive\nhistory. (1) In 1969, Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park,\nInc. , 396 U. S.\n229 , 237, as later interpreted and relied on by Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed. , 544 U. S. 167 , 176,\nrecognized that retaliation actions are encompassed by 42 U.\nS. C. §1982, which provides that “[a]ll citizens … shall have\nthe same right, … , as is enjoyed by white citizens … to inherit,\npurchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal\nproperty.” (2) This Court has long interpreted §§1981 and 1982\nalike because they were enacted together, have common language, and\nserve the same purpose of providing black citizens the same legal\nrights as enjoyed by other citizens. See, e.g., Runyon v. McCrary , 427 U. S. 160 , 183, 197,\n190. (3) In 1989, Patterson v. McLean Credit\nUnion , 491 U.\nS. 164 , 177, without mention of retaliation, narrowed §1981 by\nexcluding from its scope conduct occurring after formation of the\nemployment contract, where retaliation would most likely be found.\nSubsequently, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which\nwas designed to supersede Patterson, see Jones v. R. R. Donnelley & Sons Co. , 541 U. S. 369 , 383, by\nexplicitly defining §1981’s scope to include\npost-contract-formation conduct, §1981(b). (4) Since 1991, the\nFederal Courts of Appeals have uniformly interpreted §1981 as\nencompassing retaliation actions. Sullivan, as interpreted\nby Jackson, as well as a long line of related cases where\nthe Court construes §§1981 and 1982 similarly, lead to the\nconclusion that the view that §1981 encompasses retaliation claims\nis well embedded in the law. Stare decisis considerations\nstrongly support the Court’s adherence to that view. Such\nconsiderations impose a considerable burden on those who would seek\na different interpretation that would necessarily unsettle many\nCourt precedents. Pp. 2–8. (b) CBOCS’ several arguments, taken\nseparately or together, cannot justify a departure from this\nwell-embedded interpretation of §1981. First, while CBOCS is\ncorrect that §1981’s plain text does not expressly refer to\nretaliation, that alone is not sufficient to carry the day, given\nthis Court’s long recognition that §1982 provides protection\nagainst retaliation; Jackson ’s recent holding that Title\nIX of the Education Amendments of 1972 includes an antiretaliation\nremedy, despite Title IX’s failure to use the word “retaliation,”\n544 U. S., at 173–174, 176; and Sullivan ’s refusal to\nembrace a similar argument, see 396 U. S., at 241. Second, contrary\nto CBOCS’ assertion, Congress’ failure to include an explicit antiretaliation provision in its 1991 amendment\nof §1981 does not demonstrate an intention not to cover\nretaliation, but is more plausibly explained by the fact that,\ngiven Sullivan and the new statutory language nullifying Patterson, there was no need to include explicit\nretaliation language. Third, the argument that applying §1981 to\nemployment-related retaliation actions would create an overlap with\nTitle VII, allegedly allowing a retaliation plaintiff to circumvent\nTitle VII’s detailed administrative and procedural mechanisms and\nthereby undermine their effectiveness, proves too much. Precisely\nthe same kind of Title VII/§1981 “overlap” and potential\ncircumvention exists in respect to employment-related direct\ndiscrimination, yet Congress explicitly and intentionally created\nthat overlap, Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co. , 415 U. S. 36 ,\n48–49. Fourth, contrary to its arguments, CBOCS cannot find support\nin Burlington N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White , 548 U. S. 53 , 63,\nand Domino’s Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald , 546 U. S. 470 . While Burlington distinguished discrimination based on status\n( e.g., as women or black persons) from discrimination\nbased on conduct ( e.g., whistle-blowing that leads to\nretaliation), it did not suggest that Congress must separate the\ntwo in all events. Moreover, while Domino’s Pizza and\nother more recent cases may place greater emphasis on statutory\nlanguage than did Sullivan, any arguable change in\ninterpretive approach would not justify reexamination of\nwell-established prior law under s tare decisis principles.\nPp. 9–14. 474 F. 3d 387, affirmed. Breyer, J., delivered the opinion\nof the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Stevens, Kennedy,\nSouter, Ginsburg, and Alito, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed a\ndissenting opinion, in which Scalia, J., joined. OPINION OF THE COURT CBOCS WEST, INC. V. HUMPHRIES 553 U. S. ____ (2008) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 06-1431 CBOCS WEST, INC., PETITIONER v. HEDRICK G.\nHUMPHRIES on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the seventh circuit [May 27, 2008] Justice Breyer delivered the\nopinion of the Court. A longstanding civil rights law,\nfirst enacted just after the Civil War, provides that “[a]ll\npersons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the\nsame right in every State and Territory to make and enforce\ncontracts . . . as is enjoyed by white citizens.” Rev. Stat. §1977,\n42 U. S. C. §1981(a). The basic question before us is whether\nthe provision encompasses a complaint of retaliation against a\nperson who has complained about a violation of another person’s\ncontract-related “right.” We conclude that it does. I The case before us arises out of\na claim by respondent, Hedrick G. Humphries, a former assistant\nmanager of a Cracker Barrel restaurant, that CBOCS West, Inc.\n(Cracker Barrel’s owner) dismissed him (1) because of racial bias\n(Humphries is a black man) and (2) because he had complained to\nmanagers that a fellow assistant manager had dismissed another\nblack employee, Venus Green, for race-based reasons. Humphries\ntimely filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (EEOC), pursuant to 42 U. S. C. §2000e–5, and\nreceived a “right to sue” letter. He then filed a complaint in\nFederal District Court charging that CBOCS’ actions violated both\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as\namended, 42 U. S. C. §2000e et seq ., and the older\n“equal contract rights” provision here at issue, §1981. The\nDistrict Court dismissed Humphries’ Title VII claims for failure to\npay necessary filing fees on a timely basis. It then granted CBOCS’\nmotion for summary judgment on Humphries’ two §1981 claims.\nHumphries appealed. The U. S. Court of Appeals for\nthe Seventh Circuit ruled against Humphries and upheld the District\nCourt’s grant of summary judgment in respect to his direct\ndiscrimination claim. But it ruled in Humphries’ favor and remanded\nfor a trial in respect to his §1981 retaliation claim. In doing so,\nthe Court of Appeals rejected CBOCS’ argument that §1981 did not\nencompass a claim of retaliation. 474 F. 3d 387 (2007). CBOCS\nsought certiorari, asking us to consider this last-mentioned legal\nquestion. And we agreed to do so. See 551 U. S.___ (2007). II The question before us is whether\n§1981 encompasses retaliation claims. We conclude that it does. And\nbecause our conclusion rests in significant part upon principles of stare decisis, we begin by examining the pertinent\ninterpretive history. A The Court first considered a\ncomparable question in 1969, in Sullivan v. Little\nHunting Park, Inc. , 396 U. S. 229 . The case\narose under 42 U. S. C. §1982, a statutory provision that\nCongress enacted just after the Civil War, along with §1981, to\nprotect the rights of black citizens. The provision was similar to\n§1981 except that it focused, not upon rights to make and to\nenforce contracts, but rights related to the ownership of property.\nThe statute provides that “[a]ll citizens of the United States\nshall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is\nenjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease,\nsell, hold, and convey real and personal property.” §1982. Paul E. Sullivan , a\nwhite man, had rented his house to T. R. Freeman, Jr., a black man.\nHe had also assigned Freeman a membership share in a corporation,\nwhich permitted the owner to use a private park that the\ncorporation controlled. Because of Freeman’s race, the corporation,\nLittle Hunting Park, Inc., refused to approve the share assignment.\nAnd, when Sullivan protested, the association expelled Sullivan and\ntook away his membership shares. Sullivan sued Little Hunting Park, claiming\nthat its actions violated §1982. The Court upheld Sullivan’s claim.\nIt found that the corporation’s refusal “to approve the assignment\nof the membership share . . . was clearly an interference with\nFreeman’s [the black lessee’s] right to ‘lease.’ ” 396 U. S.,\nat 237. It added that Sullivan, the white lessor, “has standing to\nmaintain this action,” ibid ., because, as the Court had\npreviously said, “the white owner is at times ‘the only effective\nadversary’ of the unlawful restrictive covenant.” Ibid. (quoting Barrows v. Jackson , 346 U. S. 249 (1953)).\nThe Court noted that to permit the corporation to punish Sullivan\n“for trying to vindicate the rights of minorities protected by\n§1982” would give “impetus to the perpetuation of racial\nrestrictions on property.” 396 U. S., at 237. And this Court has\nmade clear that Sullivan stands for the proposition that\n§1982 encompasses retaliation claims. See Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed. , 544 U. S. 167 , 176\n(2005) (“[I]n Sullivan we interpreted a general\nprohibition on racial discrimination [in §1982] to cover\nretaliation against those who advocate the rights of groups\nprotected by that prohibition”). While the Sullivan decision\ninterpreted §1982, our precedents have long construed §§1981 and\n1982 similarly. In Runyon v. McCrary , 427 U. S. 160 , 173\n(1976), the Court considered whether §1981 prohibits private acts\nof discrimination. Citing Sullivan , along with Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. , 392 U. S. 409 (1968) and Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Assn., Inc. , 410 U. S. 431 (1973), the Court reasoned that this case law “necessarily requires\nthe conclusion that §1981, like §1982, reaches private conduct.”\n427 U. S., at 173. See also id. , at 187 (Powell, J.,\nconcurring) (“Although [Sullivan and Jones] involved §1982, rather than §1981, I agree that their considered\nholdings with respect to the purpose and meaning of §1982\nnecessarily apply to both statutes in view of their common\nderivation”); id ., at 190 (Stevens, J., concurring) (“[I]t\nwould be most incongruous to give those two sections [§§1981 and\n1982] a fundamentally different construction”). See also Shaare\nTefila Congregation v. Cobb , 481 U. S. 615 , 617–618\n(1987) (applying to §1982 the discussion and holding of Saint\nFrancis College v. Al-Khazraji , 481 U. S. 604 , 609–613\n(1987), a case interpreting §1981). As indicated in Runyon , the Court has\nconstrued §§1981 and 1982 alike because it has recognized the\nsister statutes’ common language, origin, and purposes. Like §1981,\n§1982 traces its origin to §1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14\nStat. 27. See General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania , 458 U. S. 375 , 383–384\n(1982) (noting shared historical roots of the two provisions); Tillman, supra, at 439–440 (same). Like §1981, §1982\nrepresents an immediately post-Civil War legislative effort to\nguarantee the then newly freed slaves the same legal rights that\nother citizens enjoy. See General Building Contractors Assn.,\nsupra, at 388 (noting strong purposive connection between the\ntwo provisions). Like §1981, §1982 uses broad language that says\n“[a]ll citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in\nevery State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens\n… .” Compare §1981’s language set forth above, supra ,\nat 1. See Jones, supra , at 441, n. 78 (noting the close\nparallel language of the two provisions). Indeed, §1982 differs\nfrom §1981 only in that it refers, not to the “right . . . to make\nand enforce contracts,” 42 U. S. C. §1981(a), but to the\n“right . . . to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey\nreal and personal property,” §1982. In light of these precedents, it is not\nsurprising that following Sullivan , federal appeals courts\nconcluded, on the basis of Sullivan or its reasoning, that\n§1981 encompassed retaliation claims. See, e.g ., Choudhury v. Polytechnic Inst . of\nN. Y., 735 F. 2d 38, 42–43 (CA2 1984); Goff v. Continental Oil Co ., 678 F. 2d 593, 598–599 (CA5\n1982), overruled, Carter v. South Central Bell ,\n912 F. 2d 832 (CA5 1990); Winston v. Lear-Siegler, Inc ., 558 F. 2d 1266, 1270 (CA6\n1977). B In 1989, 20 years after Sullivan, this Court in Patterson v. McLean\nCredit Union , 491 U. S. 164 ,\nsignificantly limited the scope of §1981. The Court focused upon\n§1981’s words “to make and enforce contracts” and interpreted the\nphrase narrowly. It wrote that the statutory phrase did not apply\nto “conduct by the employer after the contract relation has\nbeen established , including breach of the terms of the\ncontract or imposition of discriminatory working conditions.” Id., at 177 (emphasis added). The Court added that the\nword “enforce” does not apply to post-contract-formation conduct\nunless the discrimination at issue “ infects the legal\nprocess in ways that prevent one from enforcing contract\nrights.” Ibid . (emphasis added). Thus §1981 did not\nencompass the claim of a black employee who charged that her\nemployer had violated her employment contract by harassing her and\nfailing to promote her, all because of her race. Ibid. Since victims of an\nemployer’s retaliation will often have opposed discriminatory\nconduct taking place after the formation of the employment\ncontract, Patterson’ s holding, for a brief time, seems in\npractice to have foreclosed retaliation claims. With one exception,\nwe have found no federal court of appeals decision between the time\nwe decided Patterson and 1991 that permitted a §1981\nretaliation claim to proceed. See, e.g ., Walker v. South Central Bell Tel. Co. , 904 F. 2d 275, 276\n(CA5 1990) (per curiam); Overby v. Chevron\nUSA, Inc ., 884 F. 2d 470, 473 (CA9 1989); Sherman v. Burke Contracting, Inc ., 891\nF. 2d 1527, 1534–1535 (CA11 1990) (per curiam) . See\nalso Malhotra v. Cotter & Co ., 885 F. 2d\n1305, 1312–1314 (CA7 1989) (questioning without deciding the\nviability of retaliation claims under §1981 after Patterson ). But see Hicks v. Brown Group,\nInc ., 902 F. 2d 630, 635–638 (CA8 1990) (allowing a claim\nfor discriminatory discharge to proceed under §1981), vacated and\nremanded, 499 U. S.\n914 (1991) (ordering reconsideration in light of what became\nthe Eighth Circuit’s en banc opinion in Taggart v. Jefferson Cty. Child Support Enforcement Unit , 935\nF. 2d 947 (1991), which held that racially discriminatory\ndischarge claims under §1981 are barred). In 1991, however, Congress weighed in on the\nmatter. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, §101, 105\nStat. 1071, with the design to supersede Patterson . Jones v. R. R. Donnelley & Sons Co. , 541 U. S. 369 ,\n383 (2004). Insofar as is relevant here, the new law changed 42 U.\nS. C. §1981 by reenacting the former provision, designating it\nas §1981(a), and adding a new subsection, (b), which, says: “ ‘Make and enforce contracts’ defined “For purposes of this section, the term ‘make and enforce\ncontracts’ includes the making, performance, modification, and\ntermination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits,\nprivileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual\nrelationship.” An accompanying Senate Report\npointed out that the amendment superseded Patterson by\nadding a new subsection (b) that would “reaffirm that the right ‘to\nmake and enforce contracts’ includes the enjoyment of all benefits,\nprivileges, terms and conditions of the contractual relationship.”\nS. Rep. No. 101–315, p. 6 (1990). Among other things, it would\n“ensure that Americans may not be harassed, fired or\notherwise discriminated against in contracts because of their\nrace.” Ibid . (emphasis added). An accompanying House\nReport said that in “cutting back the scope of the rights to ‘make’\nand ‘enforce’ contracts[,] Patterson . . . has been\ninterpreted to eliminate retaliation claims that the courts had\npreviously recognized under section 1981.” H. R. Rep. No.\n102–40, pt. 1, pp. 92–93, n. 92 (1991). It added that the\nprotections that subsection (b) provided, in “the context of\nemployment discrimination … would include, but not be\nlimited to, claims of harassment, discharge, demotion, promotion,\ntransfer, retaliation , and hiring.” Id ., at 92\n(emphasis added). It also said that the new law “would restore\nrights to sue for such retaliatory conduct.” Id ., at 93,\nn. 92. After enactment of the new law, the Federal\nCourts of Appeals again reached a broad consensus that §1981, as\namended, encompasses retaliation claims. See, e.g ., Hawkins v. 1115 Legal Serv. Care , 163 F. 3d\n684, 693 (CA2 1998); Aleman v. Chugach Support Servs.,\nInc ., 485 F. 3d 206, 213–214 (CA4 2007); Foley v. University of Houston System , 355 F. 3d 333,\n338–339 (CA5 2003); Johnson v. University of\nCincinnati , 215 F. 3d 561, 575–576 (CA6 2000); 474\nF. 3d, at 403 (case below); Manatt v. Bank of\nAmerica, NA , 339 F. 3d 792, 800–801, and n. 11 (CA9\n2003); Andrews v. Lakeshore Rehabilitation\nHospital , 140 F. 3d 1405, 1411–1413 (CA11 1998). The upshot is this: (1) in 1969, Sullivan , as interpreted by Jackson , recognized\nthat §1982 encompasses a retaliation action; (2) this Court has\nlong interpreted §§1981 and 1982 alike; (3) in 1989, Patterson , without mention of retaliation, narrowed §1981\nby excluding from its scope conduct, namely post-contract-formation\nconduct, where retaliation would most likely be found; but in 1991,\nCongress enacted legislation that superseded Patterson and\nexplicitly defined the scope of §1981 to include\npost-contract-formation conduct; and (4) since 1991, the lower\ncourts have uniformly interpreted §1981 as encompassing retaliation\nactions. C Sullivan , as interpreted\nand relied upon by Jackson , as well as the long line of\nrelated cases where we construe §§1981 and 1982 similarly, lead us\nto conclude that the view that §1981 encompasses retaliation claims\nis indeed well embedded in the law. That being so, considerations\nof stare decisis strongly support our adherence to that\nview. And those considerations impose a considerable burden upon\nthose who would seek a different interpretation that would\nnecessarily unsettle many Court precedents. See, e.g. , Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public\nTransp. , 483 U.\nS. 468 , 494–495 (1987) (plurality opinion) (describing\nimportance of stare decisis ); Patterson , 491 U.\nS., at 172 (considerations of stare decisis “have special\nforce in the area of statutory interpretation”); John R. Sand\n& Gravel Co. v. United States , 552 U. S. ___, ___\n(2008) (slip op., at 8–9) (same). III In our view, CBOCS’ several\narguments, taken separately or together, cannot justify a departure\nfrom what we have just described as the well-embedded\ninterpretation of §1981. First, CBOCS points to the plain text of\n§1981—a text that says that “ [a]ll persons . . . shall\nhave the same right . . . to make and enforce contracts . . . as is\nenjoyed by white citizens. ” 42 U. S. C. §1981(a)\n(emphasis added). CBOCS adds that, insofar as Humphries complains\nof retaliation, he is complaining of a retaliatory action that the\nemployer would have taken against him whether he was black or\nwhite, and there is no way to construe this text to cover that kind\nof deprivation. Thus the text’s language, CBOCS concludes, simply\n“does not provide for a cause of action based on retaliation.”\nBrief for Petitioner 8. We agree with CBOCS that the\nstatute’s language does not expressly refer to the claim of an\nindividual (black or white) who suffers retaliation because he has\ntried to help a different individual, suffering direct racial\ndiscrimination, secure his §1981 rights. But that fact alone is not\nsufficient to carry the day. After all, this Court has long held\nthat the statutory text of §1981’s sister statute, §1982, provides\nprotection from retaliation for reasons related to the enforcement of the express statutory right. See supra , at 3. Moreover, the Court has recently read another\nbroadly worded civil rights statute, namely, Title IX of the\nEducation Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, as amended, 20 U.\nS. C. §1681 et seq ., as including an antiretaliation\nremedy. In 2005 in Jackson , the Court considered whether\nstatutory language prohibiting “discrimination [on the basis of\nsex] under any education program or activity receiving Federal\nfinancial assistance,” §1681(a), encompassed claims of retaliation\nfor complaints about sex discrimination. 544 U. S., at 173–174.\nDespite the fact that Title IX does not use the word “retaliation,”\nthe Court held in Jackson that the statute’s language\nencompassed such a claim, in part because: (1) “Congress enacted\nTitle IX just three years after Sullivan was decided”; (2)\nit is “ ‘realistic to presume that Congress was thoroughly\nfamiliar’ ” with Sullivan; and (3) Congress\nconsequently “ ‘expected its enactment’ ” of Title IX\n“ ‘to be interpreted in conformity with’ ” Sullivan . Jackson, supra , at 176. The Court in Jackson explicitly rejected the arguments the dissent\nadvances here—that Sullivan was merely a standing case,\nsee post , at 8–11 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Compare Jackson , 544 U. S., at 176, n. 1\n(“ Sullivan ’s holding was not so limited. It plainly held\nthat the white owner could maintain his own private cause\nof action under §1982 if he could show that he was ‘punished for\ntrying to vindicate the rights of minorities’ ” (emphasis in\noriginal)), with id ., at 194 (Thomas, J., dissenting). Regardless, the linguistic argument that CBOCS\nmakes was apparent at the time the Court decided Sullivan .\nSee 396 U. S., at 241 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (noting the\nconstruction of §1982 in Jones , 392 U. S. 409 was “in no way required\nby [the statute’s] language,”—one of the bases of Justice Harlan’s\ndissent in Jones —and further contending that the Court in Sullivan had gone “yet beyond” Jones ). And we\nbelieve it is too late in the day in effect to overturn the holding\nin that case (nor does CBOCS ask us to do so) on the basis of a\nlinguistic argument that was apparent, and which the Court did not\nembrace at that time. Second, CBOCS argues that Congress, in 1991\nwhen it reenacted §1981 with amendments, intended the reenacted\nstatute not to cover retaliation. CBOCS rests this\nconclusion primarily upon the fact that Congress did not include an explicit antiretaliation provision or the word\n“retaliation” in the new statutory language—although Congress has\nincluded explicit antiretaliation language in other civil rights\nstatutes. See, e.g., National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.\nS. C. §158(a)(4); Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.\nS. C. §215(a)(3); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U. S. C. §2000e–3(a); Age Discrimination in Employment Act\nof 1967, 29 U. S. C. §623(d); Americans with Disabilities Act\nof 1990, 42 U. S. C. §§12203(a)–(b); Family and Medical Leave\nAct of 1993, 29 U. S. C. §2615. We believe, however, that the circumstances to\nwhich CBOCS points find a far more plausible explanation in the\nfact that, given Sullivan and the new statutory language\nnullifying Patterson, there was no need for Congress to\ninclude explicit language about retaliation. After all, the 1991\namendments themselves make clear that Congress intended to\nsupersede the result in Patterson and embrace\npre- Patterson law. And pre- Patterson law included Sullivan . See Part II, supra . Nothing in the\nstatute’s text or in the surrounding circumstances suggests any\ncongressional effort to supersede Sullivan or the\ninterpretation that courts have subsequently given that case. To\nthe contrary, the amendments’ history indicates that Congress\nintended to restore that interpretation. See, e.g. ,\nH. R. Rep. No. 102–40, at 92 (noting that §1981(b) in the\n“context of employment discrimination … would include … claims of …\nretaliation”). Third, CBOCS points out that §1981, if applied\nto employment-related retaliation actions, would overlap with Title\nVII. It adds that Title VII requires that those who invoke its\nremedial powers satisfy certain procedural and administrative\nrequirements that §1981 does not contain. See, e.g. , 42 U.\nS. C. §2000e–5(e)(1) (charge of discrimination must be brought\nbefore EEOC within 180 days of the discriminatory act);\n§2000e–5(f)(1) (suit must be filed within 90 days of obtaining an\nEEOC right-to-sue letter). And CBOCS says that permitting a §1981\nretaliation action would allow a retaliation plaintiff to\ncircumvent Title VII’s “specific administrative and procedural\nmechanisms,” thereby undermining their effectiveness. Brief for\nPetitioner 25. This argument, however, proves too much.\nPrecisely the same kind of Title VII/§1981 “overlap” and potential\ncircumvention exists in respect to employment-related direct\ndiscrimination. Yet Congress explicitly created the overlap in\nrespect to direct employment discrimination. Nor is it obvious how\nwe can interpret §1981 to avoid employment- related overlap\nwithout eviscerating §1981 in respect to non- employment\ncontracts where no such overlap exists. Regardless, we have previously acknowledged a\n“necessary overlap” between Title VII and §1981. Patterson , 491 U. S., at 181. We have added that the\n“remedies available under Title VII and under §1981, although\nrelated, and although directed to most of the same ends, are\nseparate, distinct, and independent.” Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc. , 421 U. S. 454 , 461\n(1975). We have pointed out that Title VII provides important\nadministrative remedies and other benefits that §1981 lacks. See id., at 457–458 (detailing the benefits of Title VII to\nthose aggrieved by race-based employment discrimination). And we\nhave concluded that “Title VII was designed to supplement, rather\nthan supplant, existing laws and institutions relating to\nemployment discrimination.” Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co. , 415 U. S. 36 , 48–49\n(1974) . In a word, we have previously held that the\n“overlap” reflects congressional design. See ibid . We have\nno reason to reach a different conclusion in this case. Fourth, CBOCS says it finds support for its\nposition in two of our recent cases, Burlington N. & S. F.\nR. Co. v. White , 548 U. S. 53 (2006), and Domino’s Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald , 546 U. S. 470 (2006). In Burlington , a Title VII case, we distinguished between\ndiscrimination that harms individuals because of “who they are, i.e ., their status,” for example, as women or as black\npersons, and discrimination that harms “individuals based on what\nthey do, i.e ., their conduct,” for example,\nwhistle-blowing that leads to retaliation. 548 U. S., at 63. CBOCS\nsays that we should draw a similar distinction here and conclude\nthat §1981 only encompasses status-based discrimination. In Burlington , however, we used the status/conduct\ndistinction to help explain why Congress might have wanted its\nexplicit Title VII antiretaliation provision to sweep more broadly\n( i.e ., to include conduct outside the workplace)\nthan its substantive Title VII (status-based) antidiscrimination\nprovision. Burlington did not suggest that Congress must\nseparate the two in all events. The dissent argues that the distinction made\nin Burlington is meaningful here because it purportedly\n“underscores the fact that status-based discrimination and\nconduct-based retaliation are distinct harms that call for tailored\nlegislative treatment.” Post , at 5. The Court’s\nconstruction of a general ban on discrimination such as that\ncontained in §1981 to cover retaliation claims, the dissent\ncontinues, would somehow render the separate antiretaliation\nprovisions in other statutes “superfluous.” Ibid . But the\nCourt in Burlington did not find that Title VII’s\nantiretaliation provision was redundant; it found that the\nprovision had a broader reach than the statute’s substantive\nprovision. And in any case, we have held that “legislative\nenactments in this area have long evinced a general intent to\naccord parallel or overlapping remedies against discrimination.” Alexander , supra , at 47. See Great American\nFed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Novotny , 442 U. S. 366 , 377\n(1979) (“[S]ubstantive rights conferred in the 19th century [civil\nrights acts] were not withdrawn, sub silentio , by the\nsubsequent passage of the modern statutes”). Accordingly, the Court\nhas accepted overlap between a number of civil rights statutes. See ibid . (discussing interrelation of fair housing provisions\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1968 and §1982; between §1981 and Title\nVII). See also supra , at 11–12 (any overlap in reach\nbetween §1981 and Title VII, the statute at issue in Burlington , is by congressional design). CBOCS highlights the second case, Domino’s\nPizza , along with Patterson , and cites Cort v. Ash , 422\nU. S. 66 (1975) and Rodriguez v. United\nStates , 480 U.\nS. 522 (1987) (per curiam) , to show that this Court\nnow follows an approach to statutory interpretation that emphasizes\ntext. And that newer approach, CBOCS claims, should lead us to\nrevisit the holding in Sullivan, an older case, where the\nCourt placed less weight upon the textual language itself. But even\nwere we to posit for argument’s sake that changes in interpretive\napproach take place from time to time, we could not agree that the\nexistence of such a change would justify reexamination of\nwell-established prior law. Principles of s tare decisis, after all, demand respect for precedent whether judicial methods of\ninterpretation change or stay the same. Were that not so, those\nprinciples would fail to achieve the legal stability that they seek\nand upon which the rule of law depends. See, e.g., John R. Sand\n& Gravel Co., 552 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n8–9) . IV We conclude that\nconsiderations of stare decisis strongly support our adherence\nto Sullivan and the long line of related cases where we\ninterpret §§1981 and 1982 similarly.

LOUISIANA certiorari to the supreme court of louisiana No. 06–10119. Argued December 4, 2007—Decided March\n19, 2008 During voir dire in petitioner’s capital\nmurder case, the prosecutor used peremptory strikes to eliminate\nblack prospective jurors who had survived challenges for cause. The\njury convicted petitioner and sentenced him to death. Both on\ndirect appeal and on remand in light of Miller-El v. Dretke , 545\nU. S. 231 , the Louisiana Supreme Court rejected petitioner’s\nclaim that the prosecution’s peremptory strikes of certain\nprospective jurors, including Mr. Brooks, were based on race, in\nviolation of Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 . Held: The trial judge committed clear\nerror in rejecting the Batson objection to the strike of\nMr. Brooks. Pp. 3–13. (a) Under Batson ’s\nthree-step process for adjudicating claims such as petitioner’s,\n(1) a defendant must make a prima facie showing that the challenge\nwas based on race; (2) if so, “ ‘the prosecution must offer a\nrace-neutral basis for striking the juror in question’ ”; and\n(3) “ ‘in light of the parties’ submissions, the trial court\nmust determine whether the defendant has shown purposeful\ndiscrimination.’ ” Miller-El , supra, at 277\n(Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U. S. 322 , 328–329).\nUnless it is clearly erroneous, the trial court’s ruling must be\nsustained on appeal. The trial court’s role is pivotal, for it must\nevaluate the demeanor of the prosecutor exercising the challenge\nand the juror being excluded. Pp. 3–4. (b) While all of the circumstances\nbearing on the racial-animosity issue must be consulted in\nconsidering a Batson objection or reviewing a ruling\nclaimed to be a Batson error, the explanation given for\nstriking Mr. Brooks, a college senior attempting to fulfill his\nstudent-teaching obligation, is insufficient by itself and suffices\nfor a Batson error determination. Pp. 4–13. (1) It cannot be\npresumed that the trial court credited the prosecution’s first\nrace-neutral reason, that Mr. Brooks looked nervous. Deference is\nowed to a trial judge’s finding that an attorney credibly relied on\ndemeanor in exercising a strike, but here, the trial judge simply\nallowed the challenge without explanation. Since Mr. Brooks was not\nchallenged until the day after he was questioned and thus after\ndozens of other jurors had been called, the judge might not have\nrecalled his demeanor. Or he may have found such consideration\nunnecessary, instead basing his ruling on the second proffered\nreason for the strike. P. 6. (2) That reason—Mr.\nBrooks’ student-teaching obligation—fails even under the highly\ndeferential standard of review applicable here. Mr. Brooks was 1 of\nmore than 50 venire members expressing concern that jury service or\nsequestration would interfere with work, school, family, or other\nobligations. Although he was initially concerned about making up\nlost teaching time, he expressed no further concern once a law\nclerk reported that the school’s dean would work with Mr. Brooks if\nhe missed time for a trial that week, and the prosecutor did not\nquestion him more deeply about the matter. The proffered reason\nmust be evaluated in light of the circumstances that the colloquy\nand law clerk report took place on Tuesday, the prosecution struck\nMr. Brooks on Wednesday, the trial’s guilt phase ended on Thursday,\nand its penalty phase ended on Friday. The prosecutor’s\nscenario—that Mr. Brooks would have been inclined to find\npetitioner guilty of a lesser included offense to obviate the need\nfor a penalty phase—is both highly speculative and unlikely. Mr.\nBrooks would be in a position to shorten the trial only if most or\nall of the jurors had favored a lesser verdict. Perhaps most\ntelling, the trial’s brevity, which the prosecutor anticipated on\nthe record during voir dire, meant that jury service would\nnot have seriously interfered with Mr. Brooks’ ability to complete\nhis student teaching. The dean offered to work with him, and the\ntrial occurred relatively early in the fall term, giving Mr. Brooks\nseveral weeks to make up the time. The implausibility of the\nprosecutor’s explanation is reinforced by his acceptance of white\njurors who disclosed conflicting obligations that appear to have\nbeen at least as serious as Mr. Brooks’. Under Batson ’s\nthird stage, the prosecution’s pretextual explanation gives rise to\nan inference of discriminatory intent. There is no need to decide\nhere whether, in Batson cases, once a discriminatory\nintent is shown to be a motivating factor, the burden shifts to the\nprosecution to show that the discriminatory factor was not\ndeterminative. It is enough to recognize that a peremptory strike\nshown to have been motivated in substantial part by discriminatory\nintent could not be sustained based on any lesser showing by the\nprosecution. The record here does not show that the prosecution\nwould have pre-emptively challenged Mr. Brooks based on his\nnervousness alone, and there is no realistic possibility that the\nsubtle question of causation could be profitably explored further\non remand more than a decade after petitioner’s trial.\nPp. 6–13. 942 So. 2d 484, reversed and remanded. Alito, J., delivered the opinion\nof the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Stevens, Kennedy,\nSouter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed a\ndissenting opinion, in which Scalia, J., joined. OPINION OF THE COURT SNYDER V. LOUISIANA 552 U. S. ____ (2008) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 06-10119 ALLEN SNYDER, PETITIONER v. LOUISIANA on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nlouisiana [March 19, 2008] Justice Alito delivered the\nopinion of the Court. Petitioner Allen Snyder was\nconvicted of first-degree murder in a Louisiana court and was\nsentenced to death. He asks us to review a decision of the\nLouisiana Supreme Court rejecting his claim that the prosecution\nexercised some of its peremptory jury challenges based on race, in\nviolation of Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986). We\nhold that the trial court committed clear error in its ruling on a Batson objection, and we therefore reverse. I The crime for which petitioner\nwas convicted occurred in August 1995. At that time, petitioner and\nhis wife, Mary, had separated. On August 15, they discussed the\npossibility of reconciliation, and Mary agreed to meet with\npetitioner the next day. That night, Mary went on a date with\nHoward Wilson. During the evening, petitioner repeatedly attempted\nto page Mary, but she did not respond. At approximately 1:30 a.m.\non August 16, Wilson drove up to the home of Mary’s mother to drop\nMary off. Petitioner was waiting at the scene armed with a knife.\nHe opened the driver’s side door of Wilson’s car and repeatedly\nstabbed the occupants, killing Wilson and wounding Mary. The State charged petitioner with first-degree\nmurder and sought the death penalty based on the aggravating\ncircumstance that petitioner had knowingly created a risk of death\nor great bodily harm to more than one person. See La. Code Crim.\nProc. Ann., Art. 905.4(A)(4) (West Supp. 2008). Voir dire began on Tuesday, August\n27, 1996, and proceeded as follows. During the first phase, the\ntrial court screened the panel to identify jurors who did not meet\nLouisiana’s requirements for jury service or claimed that service\non the jury or sequestration for the duration of the trial would\nresult in extreme hardship. More than 50 prospective jurors\nreported that they had work, family, or other commitments that\nwould interfere with jury service. In each of those instances, the\nnature of the conflicting commitments was explored, and some of\nthese jurors were dismissed. App. 58–164. In the next phase, the court randomly selected\npanels of 13 potential jurors for further questioning. Id., at 166–167. The defense and prosecution addressed\neach panel and questioned the jurors both as a group and\nindividually. At the conclusion of this questioning, the court\nruled on challenges for cause. Then, the prosecution and the\ndefense were given the opportunity to use peremptory challenges\n(each side had 12) to remove remaining jurors. The court continued\nthis process of calling 13-person panels until the jury was filled.\nIn accordance with Louisiana law, the parties were permitted to\nexercise “backstrikes.” That is, they were allowed to use their\nperemptories up until the time when the final jury was sworn and\nthus were permitted to strike jurors whom they had initially\naccepted when the jurors’ panels were called. See La. Code Crim.\nProc. Ann., Art. 795(b)(1); State v. Taylor ,\n93–2201, pp. 22–23 (La. 2/28/96), 669 So. 2d 364, 376. Eighty-five prospective jurors were questioned\nas members of a panel. Thirty-six of these survived challenges for\ncause; 5 of the 36 were black; and all 5 of the prospective black\njurors were eliminated by the prosecution through the use of\nperemptory strikes. The jury found petitioner guilty of\nfirst-degree murder and determined that he should receive the death\npenalty. On direct appeal, the Louisiana Supreme Court\nconditionally affirmed petitioner’s conviction. The court rejected\npetitioner’s Batson claim but remanded the case for a nunc pro tunc determination of petitioner’s competency to\nstand trial. State v. Snyder, 98–1078 (La.\n4/14/99), 750 So. 2d 832. Two justices dissented and would\nhave found a Batson violation. See id., at 866\n(Johnson, J., dissenting), 863 (Lemmon, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). On remand, the trial court found that\npetitioner had been competent to stand trial, and the Louisiana\nSupreme Court affirmed that determination. State v. Snyder, 1998–1078 (La. 4/14/04), 874 So. 2d 739.\nPetitioner petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, and\nwhile his petition was pending, this Court decided Miller-El v. Dretke , 545 U. S. 231 (2005). We\nthen granted the petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded the\ncase to the Louisiana Supreme Court for further consideration in\nlight of Miller-El . See Snyder v. Louisiana , 545 U. S. 1137 (2005).\nOn remand, the Louisiana Supreme Court again rejected Snyder’s Batson claim, this time by a vote of 4 to 3. See 1998–1078\n(La. 9/6/06), 942 So. 2d 484. We again granted certiorari, 551\nU. S. ___ (2007), and now reverse. II Batson provides a\nthree-step process for a trial court to use in adjudicating a claim\nthat a peremptory challenge was based on race: “ ‘First, a defendant must make a prima facie\nshowing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis\nof race[; s]econd, if that showing has been made, the prosecution\nmust offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in\nquestion[; and t]hird, in light of the parties’ submissions, the\ntrial court must determine whether the defendant has shown\npurposeful discrimination.’ ” Miller-El v. Dretke , supra, at 277 (Thomas, J., dissenting)\n(quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U. S. 322 , 328–329\n(2003)). On appeal, a trial court’s ruling\non the issue of discriminatory intent must be sustained unless it\nis clearly erroneous. See Hernandez v. New York , 500 U. S. 352 ,\n369 (1991) (plurality opinion); id. , at 372 (O’Connor, J.,\njoined by Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). The trial court has\na pivotal role in evaluating Batson claims. Step three of\nthe Batson inquiry involves an evaluation of the\nprosecutor’s credibility, see 476 U. S., at 98, n. 21, and\n“the best evidence [of discriminatory intent] often will be the\ndemeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge,” Hernandez , 500 U. S., at 365 (plurality opinion). In\naddition, race-neutral reasons for peremptory challenges often\ninvoke a juror’s demeanor ( e.g. , nervousness,\ninattention), making the trial court’s first-hand observations of\neven greater importance. In this situation, the trial court must\nevaluate not only whether the prosecutor’s demeanor belies a\ndiscriminatory intent, but also whether the juror’s demeanor can\ncredibly be said to have exhibited the basis for the strike\nattributed to the juror by the prosecutor. We have recognized that\nthese determinations of credibility and demeanor lie\n“ ‘peculiarly within a trial judge’s province,’ ” ibid. (quoting Wainwright v. Witt , 469 U. S. 412 ,\n428 (1985)), and we have stated that “in the absence of exceptional\ncircumstances, we would defer to [the trial court].” 500 U. S., at\n366. III Petitioner centers his Batson claim on the prosecution’s strikes of two black\njurors, Jeffrey Brooks and Elaine Scott. Because we find that the\ntrial court committed clear error in overruling petitioner’s Batson objection with respect to Mr. Brooks, we have no\nneed to consider petitioner’s claim regarding Ms. Scott. See, e.g., United States v. Vasquez-Lopez , 22\nF. 3d 900, 902 (CA9 1994) (“[T]he Constitution forbids\nstriking even a single prospective juror for a discriminatory\npurpose”); United States v. Lane, 866 F. 2d\n103, 105 (CA4 1989); United States v. Clemons, 843 F. 2d 741, 747 (CA3 1988); United States v. Battle , 836 F. 2d 1084, 1086 (CA8 1987); United\nStates v. David , 803 F. 2d 1567, 1571 (CA11\n1986). In Miller-El v. Dretke , the Court made it clear that in considering a Batson objection, or in reviewing a ruling claimed to be Batson error, all of the circumstances that bear upon the\nissue of racial animosity must be consulted. 545 U. S., at 239.\nHere, as just one example, if there were persisting doubts as to\nthe outcome, a court would be required to consider the strike of\nMs. Scott for the bearing it might have upon the strike of Mr.\nBrooks. In this case, however, the explanation given for the strike\nof Mr. Brooks is by itself unconvincing and suffices for the\ndetermination that there was Batson error. When defense counsel made a Batson objection concerning the strike of Mr. Brooks, a college senior who\nwas attempting to fulfill his student-teaching obligation, the\nprosecution offered two race-neutral reasons for the strike. The\nprosecutor explained: “I thought about it last night. Number 1, the main\nreason is that he looked very nervous to me throughout the\nquestioning. Number 2, he’s one of the fellows that came up at the\nbeginning [of voir dire ] and said he was going to miss\nclass. He’s a student teacher. My main concern is for that reason,\nthat being that he might, to go home quickly, come back with guilty\nof a lesser verdict so there wouldn’t be a penalty phase. Those are\nmy two reasons.” App. 444. Defense counsel disputed both explanations, id., at 444–445, and the trial judge ruled as follows:\n“All right. I’m going to allow the challenge. I’m going to allow\nthe challenge.” Id., at 445. We discuss the prosecution’s\ntwo proffered grounds for striking Mr. Brooks in turn. A With respect to the first reason,\nthe Louisiana Supreme Court was correct that “nervousness cannot be\nshown from a cold transcript, which is why … the [trial] judge’s\nevaluation must be given much deference.” 942 So. 2d, at 496.\nAs noted above, deference is especially appropriate where a trial\njudge has made a finding that an attorney credibly relied on\ndemeanor in exercising a strike. Here, however, the record does not\nshow that the trial judge actually made a determination concerning\nMr. Brooks’ demeanor. The trial judge was given two explanations\nfor the strike. Rather than making a specific finding on the record\nconcerning Mr. Brooks’ demeanor, the trial judge simply allowed the\nchallenge without explanation. It is possible that the judge did\nnot have any impression one way or the other concerning Mr. Brooks’\ndemeanor. Mr. Brooks was not challenged until the day after he was\nquestioned, and by that time dozens of other jurors had been\nquestioned. Thus, the trial judge may not have recalled Mr. Brooks’\ndemeanor. Or, the trial judge may have found it unnecessary to\nconsider Mr. Brooks’ demeanor, instead basing his ruling completely\non the second proffered justification for the strike. For these\nreasons, we cannot presume that the trial judge credited the\nprosecutor’s assertion that Mr. Brooks was nervous. B The second reason proffered for\nthe strike of Mr. Brooks—his student-teaching obligation—fails even\nunder the highly deferential standard of review that is applicable\nhere. At the beginning of voir dire , when the trial court\nasked the members of the venire whether jury service or\nsequestration would pose an extreme hardship, Mr. Brooks was 1 of\nmore than 50 members of the venire who expressed concern that jury\nservice or sequestration would interfere with work, school, family,\nor other obligations. When Mr. Brooks came forward, the\nfollowing exchange took place: “MR. JEFFREY BROOKS: … I’m a\nstudent at Southern University, New Orleans. This is my last\nsemester. My major requires me to student teach, and today I’ve\nalready missed a half a day. That is part of my—it’s required for\nme to graduate this semester. “[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Mr. Brooks, if you—how\nmany days would you miss if you were sequestered on this jury? Do\nyou teach every day? “MR. JEFFREY BROOKS: Five days a week. “[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Five days a week. “MR. JEFFREY BROOKS: And it’s 8:30 through\n3:00. “[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If you missed this week,\nis there any way that you could make it up this semester? “MR. JEFFREY BROOKS: Well, the first two weeks\nI observe, the remaining I begin teaching, so there is something\nI’m missing right now that will better me towards my teaching\ncareer. “[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Is there any way that you\ncould make up the observed observation [sic] that you’re\nmissing today, at another time? “MR. JEFFREY BROOKS: It may be possible, I’m\nnot sure. “[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. So that— “THE COURT: Is there anyone we could call,\nlike a Dean or anything, that we could speak to? “MR. JEFFREY BROOKS: Actually, I spoke to my\nDean, Doctor Tillman, who’s at the university probably right\nnow. “THE COURT: All right. “MR. JEFFREY BROOKS: Would you like to speak\nto him? “THE COURT: Yeah. “MR. JEFFREY BROOKS: I don’t have his card on\nme. “THE COURT: Why don’t you give [a law clerk]\nhis number, give [a law clerk] his name and we’ll call him and\nwe’ll see what we can do. “(MR. JEFFREY BROOKS LEFT THE BENCH).” App.\n102–104. Shortly thereafter, the court\nagain spoke with Mr. Brooks: “THE LAW CLERK: Jeffrey Brooks,\nthe requirement for his teaching is a three hundred clock hour\nobservation. Doctor Tillman at Southern University said that as\nlong as it’s just this week, he doesn’t see that it would cause a\nproblem with Mr. Brooks completing his observation time within this\nsemester. “(MR. BROOKS APPROACHED THE BENCH) “THE COURT: We talked to Doctor Tillman and he\nsays he doesn’t see a problem as long as it’s just this week, you\nknow, he’ll work with you on it. Okay? “MR. JEFFREY BROOKS: Okay. “(MR. JEFFREY BROOKS LEFT THE BENCH).” Id., at 116. Once Mr. Brooks heard the law\nclerk’s report about the conversation with Doctor Tillman, Mr.\nBrooks did not express any further concern about serving on the\njury, and the prosecution did not choose to question him more\ndeeply about this matter. The colloquy with Mr. Brooks and the law\nclerk’s report took place on Tuesday, August 27; the prosecution\nstruck Mr. Brooks the following day, Wednesday, August 28; the\nguilt phase of petitioner’s trial ended the next day, Thursday,\nAugust 29; and the penalty phase was completed by the end of the\nweek, on Friday, August 30. The prosecutor’s second proffered reason for\nstriking Mr. Brooks must be evaluated in light of these\ncircumstances. The prosecutor claimed to be apprehensive that Mr.\nBrooks, in order to minimize the student-teaching hours missed\nduring jury service, might have been motivated to find petitioner\nguilty, not of first-degree murder, but of a lesser included\noffense because this would obviate the need for a penalty phase\nproceeding. But this scenario was highly speculative. Even if Mr.\nBrooks had favored a quick resolution, that would not have\nnecessarily led him to reject a finding of first-degree murder. If\nthe majority of jurors had initially favored a finding of\nfirst-degree murder, Mr. Brooks’ purported inclination might have\nled him to agree in order to speed the deliberations. Only if all\nor most of the other jurors had favored the lesser verdict would\nMr. Brooks have been in a position to shorten the trial by favoring\nsuch a verdict. Perhaps most telling, the brevity of\npetitioner’s trial—something that the prosecutor anticipated on the\nrecord during voir dire[ Footnote 1 ] —meant that serving on the jury would not\nhave seriously interfered with Mr. Brooks’ ability to complete his\nrequired student teaching. As noted, petitioner’s trial was\ncompleted by Friday, August 30. If Mr. Brooks, who reported to\ncourt and was peremptorily challenged on Wednesday, August 28, had\nbeen permitted to serve, he would have missed only two additional\ndays of student teaching, Thursday, August 29, and Friday, August\n30. Mr. Brooks’ dean promised to “work with” Mr. Brooks to see that\nhe was able to make up any student-teaching time that he missed due\nto jury service; the dean stated that he did not think that this\nwould be a problem; and the record contains no suggestion that Mr.\nBrooks remained troubled after hearing the report of the dean’s\nremarks. In addition, although the record does not include the\nacademic calendar of Mr. Brooks’ university, it is apparent that\nthe trial occurred relatively early in the fall semester. With many\nweeks remaining in the term, Mr. Brooks would have needed to make\nup no more than an hour or two per week in order to compensate for\nthe time that he would have lost due to jury service. When all of\nthese considerations are taken into account, the prosecutor’s\nsecond proffered justification for striking Mr. Brooks is\nsuspicious. The implausibility of this explanation is\nreinforced by the prosecutor’s acceptance of white jurors who\ndisclosed conflicting obligations that appear to have been at least\nas serious as Mr. Brooks’. We recognize that a retrospective\ncomparison of jurors based on a cold appellate record may be very\nmisleading when alleged similarities were not raised at trial. In\nthat situation, an appellate court must be mindful that an\nexploration of the alleged similarities at the time of trial might\nhave shown that the jurors in question were not really comparable.\nIn this case, however, the shared characteristic, i.e. ,\nconcern about serving on the jury due to conflicting obligations,\nwas thoroughly explored by the trial court when the relevant jurors\nasked to be excused for cause.[ Footnote 2 ] A comparison between Mr. Brooks and Roland\nLaws, a white juror, is particularly striking. During the initial\nstage of voir dire , Mr. Laws approached the court and\noffered strong reasons why serving on the sequestered jury would\ncause him hardship. Mr. Laws stated that he was “a self-employed\ngeneral contractor,” with “two houses that are nearing completion,\none [with the occupants] … moving in this weekend.” Id. ,\nat 129. He explained that, if he served on the jury, “the people\nwon’t [be able to] move in.” Id., at 130. Mr. Laws also\nhad demanding family obligations: “[M]y wife just had a hysterectomy, so I’m running\nthe kids back and forth to school, and we’re not originally from\nhere, so I have no family in the area, so between the two things,\nit’s kind of bad timing for me.” Ibid. Although these obligations seem substantially\nmore pressing than Mr. Brooks’, the prosecution questioned Mr. Laws\nand attempted to elicit assurances that he would be able to serve\ndespite his work and family obligations. See ibid. (prosecutor\nasking Mr. Laws “[i]f you got stuck on jury duty anyway … would you\ntry to make other arrangements as best you could?”). And the\nprosecution declined the opportunity to use a peremptory strike on\nMr. Laws. Id., at 549. If the prosecution had been\nsincerely concerned that Mr. Brooks would favor a lesser verdict\nthan first-degree murder in order to shorten the trial, it is hard\nto see why the prosecution would not have had at least as much\nconcern regarding Mr. Laws. The situation regarding another white juror,\nJohn Donnes, although less fully developed, is also significant. At\nthe end of the first day of voir dire , Mr. Donnes\napproached the court and raised the possibility that he would have\nan important work commitment later that week. Id., at 349.\nBecause Mr. Donnes stated that he would know the next morning\nwhether he would actually have a problem, the court suggested that\nMr. Donnes raise the matter again at that time. Ibid. The\nnext day, Mr. Donnes again expressed concern about serving, stating\nthat, in order to serve, “I’d have to cancel too many things,”\nincluding an urgent appointment at which his presence was\nessential. Id., at 467–468. Despite Mr. Donnes’ concern,\nthe prosecution did not strike him. Id., at 490. As previously noted, the question presented at\nthe third stage of the Batson inquiry is “ ‘whether\nthe defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.’ ” Miller-El v. Dretke , 545 U. S., at 277. The\nprosecution’s proffer of this pretextual explanation naturally\ngives rise to an inference of discriminatory intent. See id. , at 252 (noting the “pretextual significance” of a\n“stated reason [that] does not hold up”); Purkett v. Elem , 514\nU. S. 765 , 768 (1995) (per curiam) (“At [the third]\nstage, implausible or fantastic justifications may (and probably\nwill) be found to be pretexts for purposeful discrimination”); Hernandez , 500 U. S., at 365 (plurality opinion) (“In the\ntypical peremptory challenge inquiry, the decisive question will be\nwhether counsel’s race-neutral explanation for a peremptory chal-\nlenge should be believed”). Cf. St. Mary’s Honor Center v. Hicks , 509\nU. S. 502 , 511 (1993) (“[R]ejection of the de- fendant’s\nproffered [nondiscriminatory] reasons will permit the\ntrier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional\ndiscrimination”). In other circumstances, we have held that,\nonce it is shown that a discriminatory intent was a substantial or\nmotivating factor in an action taken by a state actor, the burden\nshifts to the party defending the action to show that this factor\nwas not determinative. See Hunter v. Underwood , 471 U. S. 222 ,\n228 (1985). We have not previously applied this rule in a Batson case, and we need not decide here whether that\nstandard governs in this context. For present purposes, it is\nenough to recognize that a peremptory strike shown to have been\nmotivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent could not be\nsustained based on any lesser showing by the prosecution. And in\nlight of the circumstances here—including absence of anything in\nthe record showing that the trial judge credited the claim that Mr.\nBrooks was nervous, the prosecution’s description of both of its\nproffered explanations as “main concern[s],” App. 444, and the\nadverse inference noted above—the record does not show that the\nprosecution would have pre-emptively challenged Mr. Brooks based on\nhis nervousness alone. See Hunter , supra , at 228.\nNor is there any realistic possibility that this subtle question of\ncausation could be profitably explored further on remand at this\nlate date, more than a decade after petitioner’s trial. *  *  * We therefore reverse the judgment\nof the Louisiana Supreme Court and remand the case for further\nproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Footnote 1 See, e.g., App. 98, 105, 111, 121,\n130, 204. Footnote 2 The Louisiana Supreme Court did not hold that\npetitioner had procedurally defaulted reliance on a comparison of\nthe African-American jurors whom the prosecution struck with white\njurors whom the prosecution accepted. On the contrary, the State\nSupreme Court itself made such a comparison. See 942 So. 2d\n484, 495–496 (2006).",

FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the eighth circuit No. 08–441. Argued March 31, 2009—Decided June 18,\n2009 Petitioner Gross filed suit, alleging that\nrespondent (FBL) demoted him in violation of the Age Discrimination\nin Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), which makes it unlawful for an\nemployer to take adverse action against an employee “because of\nsuch individual’s age,” 29 U. S. C. §623(a). At the close of\ntrial, and over FBL’s objections, the District Court instructed the\njury to enter a verdict for Gross if he proved, by a preponderance\nof the evidence, that he was demoted and his age was a motivating\nfactor in the demotion decision, and told the jury that age was a\nmotivating factor if it played a part in the demotion. It also\ninstructed the jury to return a verdict for FBL if it proved that\nit would have demoted Gross regardless of age. The jury returned a\nverdict for Gross. The Eighth Circuit reversed and remanded for a\nnew trial, holding that the jury had been incorrectly instructed\nunder the standard established in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins , 490 U. S. 228 , for cases\nunder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when an employee\nalleges that he suffered an adverse employment action because of\nboth permissible and impermissible considerations— i.e. , a\n“mixed-motives” case. Held: A plaintiff bringing an ADEA\ndisparate-treatment claim must prove, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that age was the “but-for” cause of the challenged\nadverse employment action. The burden of persuasion does not shift\nto the employer to show that it would have taken the action\nregardless of age, even when a plaintiff has produced some evidence\nthat age was one motivating factor in that decision.\nPp. 4–12. (a) Because Title VII is\nmaterially different with respect to the relevant burden of\npersuasion, this Court’s interpretation of the ADEA is not governed\nby Title VII decisions such as Price Waterhouse and Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa , 539 U. S. 90 , 94–95. This\nCourt has never applied Title VII’s burden-shifting framework to\nADEA claims and declines to do so now. When conducting statutory\ninterpretation, the Court “must be careful not to apply rules\napplicable under one statute to a different statute without careful\nand critical examination.” Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki , 552 U. S. ___, ___. Unlike Title VII, which has\nbeen amended to explicitly authorize discrimination claims where an\nimproper consideration was “a motivating factor” for the adverse\naction, see 42 U. S. C. §§2000e–2(m) and 2000e–5(g)(2)(B), the\nADEA does not provide that a plaintiff may establish discrimination\nby showing that age was simply a motivating factor. Moreover,\nCongress neglected to add such a provision to the ADEA when it\nadded §§2000e–2(m) and 2000e–5(g)(2)(B) to Title VII, even though\nit contemporaneously amended the ADEA in several ways. When\nCongress amends one statutory provision but not another, it is\npresumed to have acted intentionally, see EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co. , 499 U. S. 244 , 256, and\n“negative implications raised by disparate provisions are\nstrongest” where the provisions were “considered simultaneously\nwhen the language raising the implication was inserted,” Lindh v. Murphy , 521 U. S. 320 , 330.\nPp. 5–6. (b) The ADEA’s text does not authorize an\nalleged mixed-motives age discrimination claim. The ordinary\nmeaning of the ADEA’s requirement that an employer took adverse\naction “because of” age is that age was the “reason” that the\nemployer decided to act. See Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins , 507 U. S. 604 , 610. To\nestablish a disparate-treatment claim under this plain language, a\nplaintiff must prove that age was the “but-for” cause of the\nemployer’s adverse decision. See Bridge v. Phoenix\nBond & Indemnity Co. , 553 U. S. ___, ___. It follows that\nunder §623(a)(1), the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion to\nestablish that “but-for” cause. This Court has previously held this\nto be the burden’s proper allocation in ADEA cases, see, e.g ., Kentucky Retirement Systems v. EEOC , 554 U. S. ___, ___–___, ___–___, and nothing in the\nstatute’s text indicates that Congress has carved out an exception\nfor a subset of ADEA cases. Where a statute is “silent on the\nallocation of the burden of persuasion,” “the ordinary default rule\n[is] that plaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their\nclaims.” Schaffer v. Weast , 546 U. S. 49 , 56. Hence,\nthe burden of persuasion is the same in alleged mixed-motives cases\nas in any other ADEA disparate-treatment action. Pp. 7–9. (c) This Court rejects petitioner’s\ncontention that the proper interpretation of the ADEA is\nnonetheless controlled by Price Waterhouse , which\ninitially established that the burden of persuasion shifted in\nalleged mixed-motives Title VII claims. It is far from clear that\nthe Court would have the same approach were it to consider the\nquestion today in the first instance. Whatever Price\nWaterhouse ’s deficiencies in retrospect, it has become evident\nin the years since that case was decided that its burden-shifting\nframework is difficult to apply. The problems associated with its\napplication have eliminated any perceivable benefit to extending\nits framework to ADEA claims. Cf. Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc. , 433 U. S. 36 , 47.\nPp. 10–11. 526 F. 3d 356, vacated and remanded. Thomas, J., delivered the opinion\nof the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Scalia, Kennedy,\nand Alito, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in\nwhich Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. Breyer, J., filed\na dissenting opinion, in which Souter and Ginsburg, JJ.,\njoined. OPINION OF THE COURT GROSS V. FBL FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. 557 U. S. ____ (2009) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 08-441 JACK GROSS, PETITIONER v. FBL FINANCIAL\nSERVICES, INC. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eighth circuit [June 18, 2009] Justice Thomas delivered the\nopinion of the Court. The question presented by the\npetitioner in this case is whether a plaintiff must present direct\nevidence of age discrimination in order to obtain a mixed-motives\njury instruction in a suit brought under the Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U.\nS. C. §621 et seq . Because we hold that such a jury\ninstruction is never proper in an ADEA case, we vacate the decision\nbelow. I Petitioner Jack Gross began\nworking for respondent FBL Financial Group, Inc. (FBL), in 1971. As\nof 2001, Gross held the position of claims administration director.\nBut in 2003, when he was 54 years old, Gross was reassigned to the\nposition of claims project coordinator. At that same time, FBL\ntransferred many of Gross’ job responsibilities to a newly created\nposition—claims administration manager. That position was given to\nLisa Kneeskern, who had previously been supervised by Gross and who\nwas then in her early forties. App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a (District\nCourt opinion). Although Gross (in his new position) and Kneeskern\nreceived the same compensation, Gross considered the reassignment a\ndemotion because of FBL’s reallocation of his former job\nresponsibilities to Kneeskern. In April 2004, Gross filed suit\nin District Court, alleging that his reassignment to the position\nof claims project coordinator violated the ADEA, which makes it\nunlawful for an employer to take adverse action against an employee\n“because of such individual’s age.” 29 U. S. C. §623(a). The\ncase proceeded to trial, where Gross introduced evidence suggesting\nthat his reassignment was based at least in part on his age. FBL\ndefended its decision on the grounds that Gross’ reassignment was\npart of a corporate restructuring and that Gross’ new position was\nbetter suited to his skills. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a\n(District Court opinion). At the close of trial, and over FBL’s\nobjections, the District Court instructed the jury that it must\nreturn a verdict for Gross if he proved, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that FBL “demoted [him] to claims projec[t] coordinator”\nand that his “age was a motivating factor” in FBL’s decision to\ndemote him. App. 9–10. The jury was further instructed that Gross’\nage would qualify as a “ ‘motivating factor,’ if [it] played a\npart or a role in [FBL]’s decision to demote [him].” Id. ,\nat 10. The jury was also instructed regarding FBL’s burden of\nproof. According to the District Court, the “verdict must be for\n[FBL] … if it has been proved by the preponderance of the evidence\nthat [FBL] would have demoted [Gross] regardless of his age.” Ibid. The jury returned a verdict for Gross, awarding him\n$46,945 in lost compensation. Id. , at 8. FBL challenged the jury instructions on\nappeal. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\nreversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the jury had\nbeen incorrectly instructed under the standard established in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins , 490 U. S. 228 (1989).\nSee 526 F. 3d 356, 358 (2008). In Price Waterhouse ,\nthis Court addressed the proper allocation of the burden of\npersuasion in cases brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964, 78 Stat. 253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. §2000e et\nseq ., when an employee alleges that he suffered an adverse\nemployment action because of both permissible and impermissible\nconsiderations— i.e. , a “mixed-motives” case. 490 U. S., at\n232, 244–247 (plurality opinion). The Price Waterhouse decision was splintered. Four Justices joined a plurality opinion,\nsee id. , at 231–258, Justices White and O’Connor\nseparately concurred in the judgment, see id. , at 258–261\n(opinion of White, J.); id. , at 261–279 (opinion of\nO’Connor, J.), and three Justices dissented, see id. , at\n279–295 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Six Justices ultimately agreed\nthat if a Title VII plaintiff shows that discrimination was a\n“motivating” or a “ ‘substantial’ ” factor in the\nemployer’s action, the burden of persuasion should shift to the\nemployer to show that it would have taken the same action\nregardless of that impermissible consideration. See id. ,\nat 258 (plurality opinion); id. , at 259–260 (opinion of\nWhite, J.); id. , at 276 (opinion of O’Connor, J.). Justice\nO’Connor further found that to shift the burden of persuasion to\nthe employer, the employee must present “direct evidence that an\nillegitimate criterion was a substantial factor in the [employment]\ndecision.” Id. , at 276. In accordance with Circuit precedent, the\nCourt of Appeals identified Justice O’Connor’s opinion as\ncontrolling. See 526 F. 3d, at 359 (citing Erickson v. Farmland Industries, Inc. , 271 F. 3d 718, 724 (CA8\n2001)). Applying that standard, the Court of Appeals found that\nGross needed to present “[d]irect evidence … sufficient to support\na finding by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate\ncriterion actually motivated the adverse employment action.” 526\nF. 3d, at 359 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the Court\nof Appeals’ view, “direct evidence” is only that evidence that\n“show[s] a specific link between the alleged discriminatory animus\nand the challenged decision.” Ibid. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Only upon a presentation of such evidence, the\nCourt of Appeals held, should the burden shift to the employer\n“ ‘to convince the trier of fact that it is more likely than\nnot that the decision would have been the same absent consideration\nof the illegitimate factor.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Price Waterhouse , supra , at 276 (opinion of\nO’Connor, J.)). The Court of Appeals thus concluded that the\nDistrict Court’s jury instructions were flawed because they allowed\nthe burden to shift to FBL upon a presentation of a preponderance\nof any category of evidence showing that age was a\nmotivating factor—not just “direct evidence” related to FBL’s\nalleged consideration of age. See 526 F. 3d, at 360. Because\nGross conceded that he had not presented direct evidence of\ndiscrimination, the Court of Appeals held that the District Court\nshould not have given the mixed-motives instruction. Ibid. Rather, Gross should have been held to the burden of persuasion\napplicable to typical, non-mixed-motives claims; the jury thus\nshould have been instructed only to determine whether Gross had\ncarried his burden of “prov[ing] that age was the determining\nfactor in FBL’s employment action.” See ibid. We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2008),\nand now vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals. II The parties have asked us to\ndecide whether a plaintiff must “present direct evidence of\ndiscrimination in order to obtain a mixed-motive instruction in a\nnon-Title VII discrimination case.” Pet. for Cert. i. Before\nreaching this question, however, we must first determine whether\nthe burden of persuasion ever shifts to the party defending an\nalleged mixed-motives discrimination claim brought under the\nADEA.[ Footnote 1 ] We hold that\nit does not. A Petitioner relies on this Court’s\ndecisions construing Title VII for his interpretation of the ADEA.\nBecause Title VII is materially different with respect to the\nrelevant burden of persuasion, however, these decisions do not\ncontrol our construction of the ADEA. In Price Waterhouse , a\nplurality of the Court and two Justices concurring in the judgment\ndetermined that once a “plaintiff in a Title VII case proves that\n[the plaintiff’s membership in a protected class] played a\nmotivating part in an employment decision, the defendant may avoid\na finding of liability only by proving by a preponderance of the\nevidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had\nnot taken [that factor] into account.” 490 U. S., at 258; see also id. , at 259–260 (opinion of White, J.); id. , at\n276 (opinion of O’Connor, J.). But as we explained in Desert\nPalace, Inc. v. Costa , 539 U. S. 90 , 94–95 (2003), Congress\nhas since amended Title VII by explicitly authorizing\ndiscrimination claims in which an improper consideration was “a\nmotivating factor” for an adverse employment decision. See 42 U.\nS. C. §2000e–2(m) (providing that “an unlawful employment\npractice is established when the complaining party demonstrates\nthat race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a\nmotivating factor for any employment practice, even though\nother factors also motivated the practice” (emphasis added));\n§2000e–5(g)(2)(B) (restricting the remedies available to plaintiffs\nproving violations of §2000e–2(m)). This Court has never held that this\nburden-shifting framework applies to ADEA claims. And, we decline\nto do so now. When conducting statutory interpretation, we “must be\ncareful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a\ndifferent statute without careful and critical examination.” Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki , 552 U. S.\n___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 2). Unlike Title VII, the ADEA’s text\ndoes not provide that a plaintiff may establish discrimination by\nshowing that age was simply a motivating factor. Moreover, Congress\nneglected to add such a provision to the ADEA when it amended Title\nVII to add §§2000e–2(m) and 2000e–5(g)(2)(B), even though it\ncontemporaneously amended the ADEA in several ways, see Civil\nRights Act of 1991, §115, 105 Stat. 1079; id. , §302, at\n1088. We cannot ignore Congress’ decision to amend\nTitle VII’s relevant provisions but not make similar changes to the\nADEA. When Congress amends one statutory provision but not another,\nit is presumed to have acted intentionally. See EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co. , 499 U. S. 244 , 256\n(1991). Furthermore, as the Court has explained, “negative\nimplications raised by disparate provisions are strongest” when the\nprovisions were “considered simultaneously when the language\nraising the implication was inserted.” Lindh v. Murphy , 521\nU. S. 320 , 330 (1997). As a result, the Court’s interpretation\nof the ADEA is not governed by Title VII decisions such as Desert Palace and Price Waterhouse .[ Footnote 2 ] B Our inquiry therefore must focus\non the text of the ADEA to decide whether it authorizes a\nmixed-motives age discrimination claim. It does not. “Statutory\nconstruction must begin with the language employed by Congress and\nthe assumption that the ordinary meaning of that language\naccurately expresses the legislative purpose.” Engine Mfrs.\nAssn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist. , 541 U. S. 246 ,\n252 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The ADEA provides,\nin relevant part, that “[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer … to\nfail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise\ndiscriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s age.” 29 U. S. C.\n§623(a)(1) (emphasis added). The words “because of” mean “by\nreason of: on account of.” 1 Webster’s Third New International\nDictionary 194 (1966); see also 1 Oxford English Dictionary 746\n(1933) (defining “because of” to mean “By reason of , on\naccount of ” (italics in original)); The Random House\nDictionary of the English Language 132 (1966) (defining “because”\nto mean “by reason; on account”). Thus, the ordinary meaning of the\nADEA’s requirement that an employer took adverse action “because\nof” age is that age was the “reason” that the employer decided to\nact. See Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins , 507 U. S. 604 , 610\n(1993) (explaining that the claim “cannot succeed unless the\nemployee’s protected trait actually played a role in [the\nemployer’s decisionmaking] process and had a determinative\ninfluence on the outcome ” (emphasis added)). To establish a\ndisparate-treatment claim under the plain language of the ADEA,\ntherefore, a plaintiff must prove that age was the “but-for” cause\nof the employer’s adverse decision. See Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co. , 553 U. S. ___, ___\n(2008) (slip op., at 14) (recognizing that the phrase, “by reason\nof,” requires at least a showing of “but for” causation (internal\nquotation marks omitted)); Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Burr , 551 U.\nS. 47 , 63–64, and n. 14 (2007) (observing that “[i]n common\ntalk, the phrase ‘based on’ indicates a but-for causal relationship\nand thus a necessary logical condition” and that the statutory\nphrase, “based on,” has the same meaning as the phrase, “because\nof” (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. W. Keeton, D. Dobbs,\nR. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 265\n(5th ed. 1984) (“An act or omission is not regarded as a cause of\nan event if the particular event would have occurred without\nit”).[ Footnote 3 ] It follows, then, that under §623(a)(1), the\nplaintiff retains the burden of persuasion to establish that age\nwas the “but-for” cause of the employer’s adverse action. Indeed,\nwe have previously held that the burden is allocated in this manner\nin ADEA cases. See Kentucky Retirement Systems v. EEOC , 554 U. S. ___, ___–___, ___–___ (2008) (slip op., at\n2–4, 11–13); Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products,\nInc. , 530 U. S. 133 , 141, 143 (2000). And\nnothing in the statute’s text indicates that Congress has carved\nout an exception to that rule for a subset of ADEA cases. Where the\nstatutory text is “silent on the allocation of the burden of\npersuasion,” we “begin with the ordinary default rule that\nplaintiffs bear the risk of failing to prove their claims.” Schaffer v. Weast , 546 U. S. 49 , 56 (2005);\nsee also Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power\nLaboratory , 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 6)\n(“Absent some reason to believe that Congress intended otherwise, …\nwe will conclude that the burden of persuasion lies where it\nusually falls, upon the party seeking relief” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). We have no warrant to depart from the general rule\nin this setting. Hence, the burden of persuasion necessary to\nestablish employer liability is the same in alleged mixed-motives\ncases as in any other ADEA disparate-treatment action. A plaintiff\nmust prove by a preponderance of the evidence (which may be direct\nor circumstantial), that age was the “but-for” cause of the\nchallenged employer decision. See Reeves , supra ,\nat 141–143, 147.[ Footnote\n4 ] III Finally, we reject petitioner’s\ncontention that our interpretation of the ADEA is controlled by Price Waterhouse , which initially established that the\nburden of persuasion shifted in alleged mixed-motives Title VII\nclaims.[ Footnote 5 ] In any\nevent, it is far from clear that the Court would have the same\napproach were it to consider the question today in the first\ninstance. Cf. 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett , 556 U.\nS. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21) (declining to “introduc[e] a\nqualification into the ADEA that is not found in its text”); Meacham , supra , at ___ (slip op., at 16)\n(explaining that the ADEA must be “read … the way Congress wrote\nit”). Whatever the deficiencies of Price Waterhouse in retrospect, it has become evident in\nthe years since that case was decided that its burden-shifting\nframework is difficult to apply. For example, in cases tried to a\njury, courts have found it particularly difficult to craft an\ninstruction to explain its burden-shifting framework. See, e.g. , Tyler v. Bethlehem Steel Corp. ,\n958 F. 2d 1176, 1179 (CA2 1992) (referring to “the murky water\nof shifting burdens in discrimination cases”); Visser v. Packer Engineering Associates, Inc. , 924 F. 2d 655,\n661 (CA7 1991) (en banc) (Flaum, J., dissenting) (“The difficulty\njudges have in formulating [burden-shifting] instructions and\njurors have in applying them can be seen in the fact that jury\nverdicts in ADEA cases are supplanted by judgments notwithstanding\nthe verdict or reversed on appeal more frequently than jury\nverdicts generally”). Thus, even if Price Waterhouse was\ndoctrinally sound, the problems associated with its application\nhave eliminated any perceivable benefit to extending its framework\nto ADEA claims. Cf. Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE\nSylvania Inc. , 433 U. S. 36 , 47 (1977)\n(reevaluating precedent that was subject to criticism and\n“continuing controversy and confusion”); Payne v. Tennessee , 501 U. S. 808 , 839–844\n(1991) (Souter, J., concurring).[ Footnote 6 ] IV We hold that a plaintiff bringing\na disparate-treatment claim pursuant to the ADEA must prove, by a\npreponderance of the evidence, that age was the “but-for” cause of\nthe challenged adverse employment action. The burden of persuasion\ndoes not shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the\naction regardless of age, even when a plaintiff has produced some\nevidence that age was one motivating factor in that decision.\nAccordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the case for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion. It is so ordered. Footnote 1 Although the parties did not specifically\nframe the question to include this threshold inquiry, “[t]he\nstatement of any question presented is deemed to comprise every\nsubsidiary question fairly included therein.” This Court’s Rule\n14.1; see also City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of\nN. Y. , 544\nU. S. 197 , 214, n. 8 (2005) (“ ‘Questions not\nexplicitly mentioned but essential to the analysis of the decisions\nbelow or to the correct disposition of the other issues have been\ntreated as subsidiary issues fairly comprised by the question\npresented’ ” (quoting R. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, &\nK. Geller, Supreme Court Practice 414 (8th ed. 2002))); Ballard v. Commissioner , 544 U. S. 40 , 46–47, and\nn. 2 (2005) (evaluating “a question anterior” to the\n“questions the parties raised”). Footnote 2 Justice Stevens argues that the Court must\nincorporate its past interpretations of Title VII into the ADEA\nbecause “the substantive provisions of the ADEA were derived in\nhaec verba from Title VII,” post , at 4 (dissenting\nopinion) (internal quotation marks omitted), and because the Court\nhas frequently applied its interpretations of Title VII to the\nADEA, see post, at 4–6. But the Court’s approach to\ninterpreting the ADEA in light of Title VII has not been uniform.\nIn General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline , 540 U. S. 581 (2004), for example, the Court declined to interpret the phrase\n“because of … age” in 29 U. S. C. §623(a) to bar\ndiscrimination against people of all ages, even though the Court\nhad previously interpreted “because of … race [or] sex” in Title\nVII to bar discrimination against people of all races and both\nsexes, see 540 U. S., at 584, 592, n. 5. And the Court has not\ndefinitively decided whether the evidentiary framework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U. S. 792 (1973),\nutilized in Title VII cases is appropriate in the ADEA context. See Reeves v . Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc. , 530 U. S. 133 , 142 (2000); O’Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp. , 517 U. S. 308 ,\n311 (1996). In this instance, it is the textual differences between\nTitle VII and the ADEA that prevent us from applying Price\nWaterhouse and Desert Palace to federal age\ndiscrimination claims. Footnote 3 Justice Breyer contends that there is\n“nothing unfair or impractical” about hinging liability on whether\n“forbidden motive … play[ed] a role in the employer’s decision.” Post , at 2–3 (dissenting opinion). But that is a decision\nfor Congress to make. See Florida Dept. of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc. , 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008)\n(slip op., at 18). Congress amended Title VII to allow for employer\nliability when discrimination “was a motivating factor for\nany employment practice, even though other factors also motivated\nthe practice,” 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(m) (emphasis added), but\ndid not similarly amend the ADEA, see supra , at 5–6. We\nmust give effect to Congress’ choice. See 14 Penn Plaza\nLLC v. Pyett , 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at\n21). Footnote 4 Because we hold that ADEA plaintiffs retain\nthe burden of persuasion to prove all disparate-treatment claims,\nwe do not need to address whether plaintiffs must present direct,\nrather than circumstantial, evidence to obtain a burden-shifting\ninstruction. There is no heightened evidentiary requirement for\nADEA plaintiffs to satisfy their burden of persuasion that age was\nthe “but-for” cause of their employer’s adverse action, see 29 U.\nS. C. §623(a), and we will imply none. “Congress has been\nunequivocal when imposing heightened proof requirements” in other\nstatutory contexts, including in other subsections within Title 29,\nwhen it has seen fit. See Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U. S. 90 , 99 (2003); see also, e.g. , 25 U. S. C. §2504(b)(2)(B) (imposing “clear and\nconvincing evidence” standard); 29 U. S. C. §722(a)(2)(A)\n(same). Footnote 5 Justice Stevens also contends that we must\napply Price Waterhouse under the reasoning of Smith v. City of Jackson , 544 U. S. 228 (2005).\nSee post , at 7. In Smith , the Court applied to\nthe ADEA its pre-1991 interpretation of Title VII with respect to\ndisparate-impact claims despite Congress’ 1991 amendment adding\ndisparate-impact claims to Title VII but not the ADEA. 544 U. S.,\nat 240. But the amendments made by Congress in this same\nlegislation, which added the “motivating factor” language to Title\nVII, undermine Justice Stevens’ argument. Congress not only\nexplicitly added “motivating factor” liability to Title VII, see supra , at 5–6, but it also partially abrogated Price\nWaterhouse ’s holding by eliminating an employer’s complete\naffirmative defense to “motivating factor” claims, see 42 U.\nS. C. §2000e–5(g)(2)(B). If such “motivating factor” claims\nwere already part of Title VII, the addition of §2000e–5(g)(2)(B)\nalone would have been sufficient. Congress’ careful tailoring of\nthe “motivating factor” claim in Title VII, as well as the absence\nof a provision parallel to §2000e–2(m) in the ADEA, confirms that\nwe cannot transfer the Price Waterhouse burden-shifting\nframework into the ADEA. Footnote 6 Gross points out that the Court has also\napplied a burden-shifting framework to certain claims brought in\ncontexts other than pursuant to Title VII. See Brief for Petitioner\n54–55 (citing, inter alia , NLRB v. Transportation Management Corp. , 462 U. S. 393 , 401–403\n(1983) (claims brought under the National Labor Relations Act\n(NLRA)); Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle , 429 U. S. 274 ,\n287 (1977) (constitutional claims)). These cases, however, do not\nrequire the Court to adopt his contra statutory position.  The\ncase involving the NLRA did not require the Court to decide in the\nfirst instance whether burden shifting should apply as the Court\ninstead deferred to the National Labor Relation Board’s\ndetermination that such a framework was appropriate. See NLRB , supra , at 400–403. And the constitutional\ncases such as Mt. Healthy have no bearing on the correct\ninterpretation of ADEA claims, which are governed by statutory\ntext.",

MASSEY COAL\nCO., INC., et al. certiorari to the supreme court of appeals of west\nvirginia No. 08–22. Argued March 3, 2009—Decided June 8,\n2009 After a West Virginia jury found respondents, a\ncoal company and its affiliates (hereinafter Massey), liable for\nfraudulent misrepresentation, concealment, and tortious\ninterference with existing contractual relations and awarded\npetitioners (hereinafter Caperton) $50 million in damages, West\nVirginia held its 2004 judicial elections. Knowing the State\nSupreme Court of Appeals would consider the appeal, Don\nBlankenship, Massey’s chairman and principal officer, supported\nBrent Benjamin rather than the incumbent justice seeking\nreelection. His $3 million in contributions exceeded the total\namount spent by all other Benjamin supporters and by Benjamin’s own\ncommittee. Benjamin won by fewer than 50,000 votes. Before Massey\nfiled its appeal, Caperton moved to disqualify now-Justice Benjamin\nunder the Due Process Clause and the State’s Code of Judicial\nConduct, based on the conflict caused by Blankenship’s campaign\ninvolvement. Justice Benjamin denied the motion, indicating that he\nfound nothing showing bias for or against any litigant. The court\nthen reversed the $50 million verdict. During the rehearing\nprocess, Justice Benjamin refused twice more to recuse himself, and\nthe court once again reversed the jury verdict. Four months later,\nJustice Benjamin filed a concurring opinion, defending the court’s\nopinion and his recusal decision. Held: In all the circumstances of\nthis case, due process requires recusal. Pp. 6–20. (a) The Due Process Clause\nincorporated the common-law rule requiring recusal when a judge has\n“a direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest” in a case, Tumey v. Ohio , 273 U. S. 510 , 523, but\nthis Court has also identified additional instances which, as an\nobjective matter, require recusal where “the probability of actual\nbias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be\nconstitutionally tolerable,” Withrow v. Larkin , 421 U. S. 35 , 47.\nTwo such instances place the present case in proper context.\nPp. 6–11. (1) The first involved\nlocal tribunals in which a judge had a financial interest in a\ncase’s outcome that was less than what would have been considered\npersonal or direct at common law. In Tumey, a village\nmayor with authority to try those accused of violating a law\nprohibiting the possession of alcoholic beverages faced two\npotential conflicts: Because he received a salary supplement for\nperforming judicial duties that was funded from the fines assessed,\nhe received a supplement only upon a conviction; and sums from the\nfines were deposited to the village’s general treasury fund for\nvillage improvements and repairs. Disqualification was required\nunder the principle that “[e]very procedure which would offer a\npossible temptation to the average man as a judge to forget the\nburden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might\nlead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the\nState and the accused, denies the latter due process of law.” 273\nU. S.em>., at 532. In Ward v. Monroeville , 409 U. S. 57 , a\nconviction in another mayor’s court was invalidated even though the\nfines assessed went only to the town’s general fisc, because the\nmayor faced a “ ‘ possible temptation’ ” created by\nhis “executive responsibilities for village finances.” Id., at 60 . Recusal was also required where an\nAlabama Supreme Court justice cast the deciding vote upholding a\npunitive damages award while he was the lead plaintiff in a nearly\nidentical suit pending in Alabama’s lower courts. Aetna Life\nIns. Co. v. Lavoie , 475 U. S. 813 . The\nproper constitutional inquiry was not “whether in fact [the\njustice] was influenced,” id. , at 825, but “whether\nsitting on [that] case … ‘ “would offer a possible temptation\nto the average … judge to … lead him not to hold the balance nice,\nclear and true,” ’ ” ibid. While the “degree or\nkind of interest … sufficient to disqualify a judge … ‘[could not]\nbe defined with precision, ’ ” id., at 822, the test\ndid have an objective component. Pp. 7–9. (2) The second instance\nemerged in the criminal contempt context, where a judge had no\npecuniary interest in the case but had determined in an earlier\nproceeding whether criminal charges should be brought and then\nproceeded to try and convict the petitioners. In re\nMurchison , 349\nU. S. 133 . Finding that “no man can be a judge in his own\ncase,” and “no man is permitted to try cases where he has an\ninterest in the outcome,” id. , at 136, the Court noted\nthat the circumstances of the case and the prior relationship\nrequired recusal. The judge’s prior relationship with the\ndefendant, as well as the information acquired from the prior\nproceeding, was critical. In reiterating that the rule that “a\ndefendant in criminal contempt proceedings should be [tried] before\na judge other than the one reviled by the contemnor,” Mayberry v. Pennsylvania , 400 U. S. 455 , 466,\nrests on the relationship between the judge and the defendant, id. , at 465, the Court noted that the objective inquiry is\nnot whether the judge is actually biased, but whether the average\njudge in his position is likely to be neutral or there is an\nunconstitutional “ ‘potential for bias,’ ” id., at 466. Pp. 9–11. (b) Because the objective standards\nimplementing the Due Process Clause do not require proof of actual\nbias, this Court does not question Justice Benjamin’s subjective\nfindings of impartiality and propriety and need not determine\nwhether there was actual bias. Rather, the question is whether,\n“under a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies and human\nweakness,” the interest “poses such a risk of actual bias or\nprejudgment that the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of\ndue process is to be adequately implemented.” Withrow , 421\nU. S. , at 47. There is a serious risk of actual bias when\na person with a personal stake in a particular case had a\nsignificant and disproportionate influence in placing the judge on\nthe case by raising funds or directing the judge’s election\ncampaign when the case was pending or imminent. The proper inquiry\ncenters on the contribution’s relative size in comparison to the\ntotal amount contributed to the campaign, the total amount spent in\nthe election, and the apparent effect of the contribution on the\noutcome. It is not whether the contributions were a necessary and\nsufficient cause of Benjamin’s victory. In an election decided by\nfewer than 50,000 votes, Blankenship’s campaign\ncontributions—compared to the total amount contributed to the\ncampaign, as well as the total amount spent in the election—had a\nsignificant and disproportionate influence on the outcome. And the\nrisk that Blankenship’s influence engendered actual bias is\nsufficiently substantial that it “must be forbidden if the\nguarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.” Ibid. The temporal relationship between the campaign\ncontributions, the justice’s election, and the pendency of the case\nis also critical, for it was reasonably foreseeable that the\npending case would be before the newly elected justice. There is no\nallegation of a quid pro quo agreement, but the\nextraordinary contributions were made at a time when Blankenship\nhad a vested stake in the outcome. Just as no man is allowed to be\na judge in his own cause, similar fears of bias can arise\nwhen—without the other parties’ consent—a man chooses the judge in\nhis own cause. Applying this principle to the judicial election\nprocess, there was here a serious, objective risk of actual bias\nthat required Justice Benjamin’s recusal. Pp. 11–16. (c) Massey and its amici err in\npredicting that this decision will lead to adverse consequences\nranging from a flood of recusal motions to unnecessary interference\nwith judicial elections. They point to no other instance involving\njudicial campaign contributions that presents a potential for bias\ncomparable to the circumstances in this case, which are extreme by\nany measure. And because the States may have codes of conduct with\nmore rigorous recusal standards than due process requires, most\nrecusal disputes will be resolved without resort to the\nConstitution, making the constitutional standard’s application\nrare.

MASSEY COAL CO. 556 U. S. ____ (2009) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 08-22 HUGH M. CAPERTON, et al., PETITIONERS v. A. T. MASSEY COAL COMPANY, INC., et al. on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nappeals of west virginia [June 8, 2009] Justice Kennedy delivered the\nopinion of the Court. In this case the Supreme Court of\nAppeals of West Virginia reversed a trial court judgment, which had\nentered a jury verdict of $50 million. Five justices heard the\ncase, and the vote to reverse was 3 to 2. The question presented is\nwhether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was\nviolated when one of the justices in the majority denied a recusal\nmotion. The basis for the motion was that the justice had received\ncampaign contributions in an extraordinary amount from, and through\nthe efforts of, the board chairman and principal officer of the\ncorporation found liable for the damages. Under our precedents there are objective\nstandards that require recusal when “the probability of actual bias\non the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high to be\nconstitutionally tolerable.” Withrow v. Larkin , 421 U. S. 35 , 47\n(1975). Applying those precedents, we find that, in all the\ncircumstances of this case, due process requires recusal. I In August 2002 a West Virginia\njury returned a verdict that found respondents A. T. Massey Coal\nCo. and its affiliates (hereinafter Massey) liable for fraudulent\nmisrepresentation, concealment, and tortious interference with\nexisting contractual relations. The jury awarded petitioners Hugh\nCaperton, Harman Development Corp., Harman Mining Corp., and\nSovereign Coal Sales (hereinafter Caperton) the sum of $50 million\nin compensatory and punitive damages. In June 2004 the state trial\ncourt denied Massey’s post-trial motions challenging the verdict\nand the damages award, finding that Massey “intentionally acted in\nutter disregard of [Caperton’s] rights and ultimately destroyed\n[Caperton’s] businesses because, after conducting cost-benefit\nanalyses, [Massey] concluded it was in its financial interest to do\nso.” App. 32a, ¶10(p). In March 2005 the trial court denied\nMassey’s motion for judgment as a matter of law. Don Blankenship is Massey’s chairman, chief\nexecutive officer, and president. After the verdict but before the\nappeal, West Virginia held its 2004 judicial elections. Knowing the\nSupreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia would consider the appeal\nin the case, Blankenship decided to support an attorney who sought\nto replace Justice McGraw. Justice McGraw was a candidate for\nreelection to that court. The attorney who sought to replace him\nwas Brent Benjamin. In addition to contributing the $1,000\nstatutory maximum to Benjamin’s campaign committee, Blankenship\ndonated almost $2.5 million to “And For The Sake Of The Kids,” a\npolitical organization formed under 26 U. S. C. §527. The §527\norganization opposed McGraw and supported Benjamin. App. 672a–673a.\nBlankenship’s donations accounted for more than two-thirds of the\ntotal funds it raised. Id., at 150a. This was not all.\nBlankenship spent, in addition, just over $500,000 on independent\nexpenditures—for direct mailings and letters soliciting donations\nas well as television and newspaper advertisements—“ ‘to\nsupport … Brent Benjamin.’ ” Id., at 184a, 186a, 200a\n(bold typeface omitted) (quoting Blankenship’s state campaign\nfinancial disclosure filings). To provide some perspective, Blankenship’s $3\nmillion in contributions were more than the total amount spent by\nall other Benjamin supporters and three times the amount spent by\nBenjamin’s own committee. Id., at 288a. Caperton contends\nthat Blankenship spent $1 million more than the total amount spent\nby the campaign committees of both candidates combined. Brief for\nPetitioners 28. Benjamin won. He received 382,036 votes\n(53.3%), and McGraw received 334,301 votes (46.7%). App. 677a. In October 2005, before Massey filed its\npetition for appeal in West Virginia’s highest court, Caperton\nmoved to disqualify now-Justice Benjamin under the Due Process\nClause and the West Virginia Code of Judicial Conduct, based on the\nconflict caused by Blankenship’s campaign involvement. Justice\nBenjamin denied the motion in April 2006. He indicated that he\n“carefully considered the bases and accompanying exhibits proffered\nby the movants.” But he found “no objective information … to show\nthat this Justice has a bias for or against any litigant, that this\nJustice has prejudged the matters which comprise this litigation,\nor that this Justice will be anything but fair and impartial.” Id., at 336a–337a. In December 2006 Massey filed its\npetition for appeal to challenge the adverse jury verdict. The West\nVirginia Supreme Court of Appeals granted review. In November 2007 that court reversed the $50\nmillion verdict against Massey. The majority opinion, authored by\nthen-Chief Justice Davis and joined by Justices Benjamin and\nMaynard, found that “Massey’s conduct warranted the type of\njudgment rendered in this case.” Id., at 357a. It\nreversed, nevertheless, based on two independent grounds—first,\nthat a forum-selection clause contained in a contract to which\nMassey was not a party barred the suit in West Virginia, and,\nsecond, that res judicata barred the suit due to an out-of-state\njudgment to which Massey was not a party. Id., at 345a.\nJustice Starcher dissented, stating that the “majority’s opinion is\nmorally and legally wrong.” Id., at 420a–422a. Justice\nAlbright also dissented, accusing the majority of “misapplying the\nlaw and introducing sweeping ‘new law’ into our jurisprudence that\nmay well come back to haunt us.” Id., at 430a–431a. Caperton sought rehearing, and the parties\nmoved for disqualification of three of the five justices who\ndecided the appeal. Photos had surfaced of Justice Maynard\nvacationing with Blankenship in the French Riviera while the case\nwas pending. Id., at 440a–441a, 456a. Justice Maynard\ngranted Caperton’s recusal motion. On the other side Justice\nStarcher granted Massey’s recusal motion, apparently based on his\npublic criticism of Blankenship’s role in the 2004 elections. In\nhis recusal memorandum Justice Starcher urged Justice Benjamin to\nrecuse himself as well. He noted that “Blankenship’s bestowal of\nhis personal wealth, political tactics, and ‘friendship’ have\ncreated a cancer in the affairs of this Court.” Id., at\n459a–460a. Justice Benjamin declined Justice Starcher’s suggestion\nand denied Caperton’s recusal motion. The court granted rehearing. Justice Benjamin,\nnow in the capacity of acting chief justice, selected Judges\nCookman and Fox to replace the recused justices. Caperton moved a\nthird time for disqualification, arguing that Justice Benjamin had\nfailed to apply the correct standard under West Virginia\nlaw— i.e. , whether “a reasonable and prudent person,\nknowing these objective facts, would harbor doubts about Justice\nBenjamin’s ability to be fair and impartial.” Id., at\n466a, ¶8. Caperton also included the results of a public opinion\npoll, which indicated that over 67% of West Virginians doubted\nJustice Benjamin would be fair and impartial. Justice Benjamin\nagain refused to withdraw, noting that the “push poll” was “neither\ncredible nor sufficiently reliable to serve as the basis for an\nelected judge’s disqualification.” Id., at 483a. In April 2008 a divided court again reversed\nthe jury verdict, and again it was a 3-to-2 decision. Justice Davis\nfiled a modified version of his prior opinion, repeating the two\nearlier holdings. She was joined by Justice Benjamin and Judge Fox.\nJustice Albright, joined by Judge Cookman, dissented: “Not only is\nthe majority opinion unsupported by the facts and existing case\nlaw, but it is also fundamentally unfair. Sadly, justice was\nneither honored nor served by the majority.” ___ W. Va. ___,\n___, ___ S. E. 2d ___, ___; App. 633a. The dissent also noted\n“genuine due process implications arising under federal law” with\nrespect to Justice Benjamin’s failure to recuse himself. ___\nW. Va., at ___, n. 16, ___ S. E. 2d, at ___,\nn. 16; App. 634a, n. 16 (citing Aetna Life Ins.\nCo. v. Lavoie , 475 U. S. 813 (1986); In re Murchison , 349 U. S. 133 , 136\n(1955)). Four months later—a month after the petition\nfor writ of certiorari was filed in this Court—Justice Benjamin\nfiled a concurring opinion. He defended the merits of the majority\nopinion as well as his decision not to recuse. He rejected\nCaperton’s challenge to his participation in the case under both\nthe Due Process Clause and West Virginia law. Justice Benjamin\nreiterated that he had no “ ‘ direct, personal,\nsubstantial, pecuniary interest’ in this case.’ ” ___\nW. Va., at ___, ___ S. E. 2d, at ___; App. 677a (quoting Lavoie , supra , at 822). Adopting “a standard\nmerely of ‘appearances,’ ” he concluded, “seems little more\nthan an invitation to subject West Virginia’s justice system to the\nvagaries of the day—a framework in which predictability and\nstability yield to supposition, innuendo, half-truths, and partisan\nmanipulations.” ___ W. Va., at ___, ___ S. E. 2d, at ___;\nApp. 692a. We granted certiorari. 555 U. S. ___\n(2008). II It is axiomatic that “[a] fair\ntrial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.” Murchison , supra, at 136. As the Court has\nrecognized, however, “most matters relating to judicial\ndisqualification [do] not rise to a constitutional level.” FTC v. Cement Institute , 333 U. S. 683 , 702\n(1948). The early and leading case on the subject is Tumey v. Ohio , 273 U. S. 510 (1927).\nThere, the Court stated that “matters of kinship, personal bias,\nstate policy, remoteness of interest, would seem generally to be\nmatters merely of legislative discretion.” Id. , at\n523. The Tumey Court\nconcluded that the Due Process Clause incorporated the common-law\nrule that a judge must recuse himself when he has “a direct,\npersonal, substantial, pecuniary interest” in a case. Ibid. This rule reflects the maxim that “[n]o man is\nallowed to be a judge in his own cause; because his interest would\ncertainly bias his judgment, and, not improbably, corrupt his\nintegrity.” The Federalist No. 10, p. 59 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J.\nMadison); see Frank, Disqualification of Judges, 56 Yale L. J.\n605, 611–612 (1947) (same). Under this rule, “disqualification for\nbias or prejudice was not permitted”; those matters were left to\nstatutes and judicial codes. Lavoie , supra, at\n820; see also Part IV, infra (discussing judicial codes).\nPersonal bias or prejudice “alone would not be sufficient basis for\nimposing a constitutional requirement under the Due Process\nClause.” Lavoie , supra , at 820. As new problems have emerged that were not\ndiscussed at common law, however, the Court has identified\nadditional instances which, as an objective matter, require\nrecusal. These are circumstances “in which experience teaches that\nthe probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or\ndecisionmaker is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.” Withrow , 421 U. S., at 47. To place the present case in\nproper context, two instances where the Court has required recusal\nmerit further discussion. A The first involved the emergence\nof local tribunals where a judge had a financial interest in the\noutcome of a case, although the interest was less than what would\nhave been considered personal or direct at common law. This was the problem addressed in Tumey . There, the mayor of a village had the authority to\nsit as a judge (with no jury) to try those accused of violating a\nstate law prohibiting the possession of alcoholic beverages.\nInherent in this structure were two potential conflicts. First, the\nmayor received a salary supplement for performing judicial duties,\nand the funds for that compensation derived from the fines assessed\nin a case. No fines were assessed upon acquittal. The mayor-judge\nthus received a salary supplement only if he convicted the\ndefendant. 273 U. S., at 520. Second, sums from the criminal fines\nwere deposited to the village’s general treasury fund for village\nimprovements and repairs. Id. , at 522. The Court held that the Due Process Clause\nrequired disqualification “both because of [the mayor-judge’s]\ndirect pecuniary interest in the outcome, and because of his\nofficial motive to convict and to graduate the fine to help the\nfinancial needs of the village.” Id. , at 535. It so held\ndespite observing that “[t]here are doubtless mayors who would not\nallow such a consideration as $12 costs in each case to affect\ntheir judgment in it.” Id. , at 532. The Court articulated\nthe controlling principle: “Every procedure which would offer a possible\ntemptation to the average man as a judge to forget the burden of\nproof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead him\nnot to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and\nthe accused, denies the latter due process of law.” Ibid. The Court was thus concerned with more than the\ntraditional common-law prohibition on direct pecuniary interest. It\nwas also concerned with a more general concept of interests that\ntempt adjudicators to disregard neutrality. This concern with conflicts resulting from\nfinancial incentives was elaborated in Ward v. Monroeville , 409 U. S. 57 (1972),\nwhich invalidated a conviction in another mayor’s court. In Monroeville , unlike in Tumey , the mayor received\nno money; instead, the fines the mayor assessed went to the town’s\ngeneral fisc. The Court held that “[t]he fact that the mayor [in Tumey ] shared directly in the fees and costs did not\ndefine the limits of the principle.” 409 U. S., at 60. The\nprinciple, instead, turned on the “ ‘possible\ntemptation’ ” the mayor might face; the mayor’s “executive\nresponsibilities for village finances may make him partisan to\nmaintain the high level of contribution [to those finances] from\nthe mayor’s court.” Ibid. As the Court reiterated in\nanother case that Term, “the [judge’s] financial stake need not be\nas direct or positive as it appeared to be in Tumey .” Gibson v. Berryhill , 411 U. S. 564 , 579\n(1973) (an administrative board composed of optometrists had a\npecuniary interest of “sufficient substance” so that it could not\npreside over a hearing against competing optometrists). The Court in Lavoie further clarified\nthe reach of the Due Process Clause regarding a judge’s financial\ninterest in a case. There, a justice had cast the deciding vote on\nthe Alabama Supreme Court to uphold a punitive damages award\nagainst an insurance company for bad-faith refusal to pay a claim.\nAt the time of his vote, the justice was the lead plaintiff in a\nnearly identical lawsuit pending in Alabama’s lower courts. His\ndeciding vote, this Court surmised, “undoubtedly ‘raised the\nstakes’ ” for the insurance defendant in the justice’s suit.\n475 U. S., at 823–824. The Court stressed that it was “not required\nto decide whether in fact [the justice] was influenced.” Id. , at 825. The proper constitutional inquiry is “whether\nsitting on the case then before the Supreme Court of Alabama\n‘ “would offer a possible temptation to the average … judge to\n… lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and\ntrue.” ’ ” Ibid. (quoting Monroeville , supra , at 60, in turn quoting Tumey , supra , at 532). The Court underscored that “what degree or\nkind of interest is sufficient to disqualify a judge from sitting\n‘cannot be defined with precision.’ ” 475 U. S., at 822\n(quoting Murchison , 349 U. S., at 136). In the Court’s\nview, however, it was important that the test have an objective\ncomponent. The Lavoie Court proceeded to\ndistinguish the state court justice’s particular interest in the\ncase, which required recusal, from interests that were not a\nconstitutional concern. For instance, “while [the other] justices\nmight conceivably have had a slight pecuniary interest” due to\ntheir potential membership in a class-action suit against their own\ninsurance companies, that interest is “ ‘too remote and\ninsubstantial to violate the constitutional constraints.’ ”\n475 U. S., at 825–826 (quoting Marshall v. Jerrico,\nInc. , 446 U. S.\n238 , 243 (1980)). B The second instance requiring\nrecusal that was not discussed at common law emerged in the\ncriminal contempt context, where a judge had no pecuniary interest\nin the case but was challenged because of a conflict arising from\nhis participation in an earlier proceeding. This Court\ncharacterized that first proceeding (perhaps pejoratively) as a\n“ ‘one-man grand jury.’ ” Murchison , 349 U. S.,\nat 133. In that first proceeding, and as\nprovided by state law, a judge examined witnesses to determine\nwhether criminal charges should be brought. The judge called the\ntwo petitioners before him. One petitioner answered questions, but\nthe judge found him untruthful and charged him with perjury. The\nsecond declined to answer on the ground that he did not have\ncounsel with him, as state law seemed to permit. The judge charged\nhim with contempt. The judge proceeded to try and convict both\npetitioners. Id. , at 134–135. This Court set aside the convictions on\ngrounds that the judge had a conflict of interest at the trial\nstage because of his earlier participation followed by his decision\nto charge them. The Due Process Clause required disqualification.\nThe Court recited the general rule that “no man can be a judge in\nhis own case,” adding that “no man is permitted to try cases where\nhe has an interest in the outcome.” Id. , at 136. It noted\nthat the disqualifying criteria “cannot be defined with precision.\nCircumstances and relationships must be considered.” Ibid. These circumstances and the prior relationship required recusal:\n“Having been a part of [the one-man grand jury] process a judge\ncannot be, in the very nature of things, wholly disinterested in\nthe conviction or acquittal of those accused.” Id. , at\n137. That is because “[a]s a practical matter it is difficult if\nnot impossible for a judge to free himself from the influence of\nwhat took place in his ‘grand-jury’ secret session.” Id. ,\nat 138. The Murchison Court was careful to\ndistinguish the circumstances and the relationship from those where\nthe Constitution would not require recusal. It noted that the\nsingle-judge grand jury is “more a part of the accusatory process\nthan an ordinary lay grand juror,” and that “adjudication by a\ntrial judge of a contempt committed in [a judge’s] presence in open\ncourt cannot be likened to the proceedings here.” Id. , at\n137. The judge’s prior relationship with the defendant, as well as\nthe information acquired from the prior proceeding, was of critical\nimport. Following Murchison the Court held in Mayberry v. Pennsylvania , 400 U. S. 455 , 466\n(1971), “that by reason of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment a defendant in criminal contempt proceedings should be\ngiven a public trial before a judge other than the one reviled by\nthe contemnor.” The Court reiterated that this rule rests on the\nrelationship between the judge and the defendant: “[A] judge,\nvilified as was this Pennsylvania judge, necessarily becomes\nembroiled in a running, bitter controversy. No one so cruelly\nslandered is likely to maintain that calm detachment necessary for\nfair adjudication.” Id. , at 465. Again, the Court considered the specific\ncircumstances presented by the case. It noted that “not every\nattack on a judge … disqualifies him from sitting.” Ibid. The Court distinguished the case from Ungar v. Sarafite , 376 U. S. 575 (1964), in\nwhich the Court had “ruled that a lawyer’s challenge, though\n‘disruptive, recalcitrant and disagreeable commentary,’ was still\nnot ‘an insulting attack upon the integrity of the judge carrying\nsuch potential for bias as to require disqualification.’ ” Mayberry , supra , at 465–466 (quoting Ungar , supra , at 584). The inquiry is an\nobjective one. The Court asks not whether the judge is actually,\nsubjectively biased, but whether the average judge in his position\nis “likely” to be neutral, or whether there is an unconstitutional\n“potential for bias.” III Based on the principles described\nin these cases we turn to the issue before us. This problem arises\nin the context of judicial elections, a framework not presented in\nthe precedents we have reviewed and discussed. Caperton contends that\nBlankenship’s pivotal role in getting Justice Benjamin elected\ncreated a constitutionally intolerable probability of actual bias.\nThough not a bribe or criminal influence, Justice Benjamin would\nnevertheless feel a debt of gratitude to Blankenship for his\nextraordinary efforts to get him elected. That temptation, Caperton\nclaims, is as strong and inherent in human nature as was the\nconflict the Court confronted in Tumey and Monroeville when a mayor-judge (or the city) benefited\nfinancially from a defendant’s conviction, as well as the conflict\nidentified in Murchison and Mayberry when a judge\nwas the object of a defendant’s contempt. Justice Benjamin was careful to address the\nrecusal motions and explain his reasons why, on his view of the\ncontrolling standard, disqualification was not in order. In four\nseparate opinions issued during the course of the appeal, he\nexplained why no actual bias had been established. He found no\nbasis for recusal because Caperton failed to provide “objective\nevidence” or “objective information,” but merely “subjective\nbelief” of bias. ___ W. Va., at ___, ___–___, ___ S. E.\n2d, at ___, ___–___; App. 336a, 337a–338a, 444a–445a. Nor could\nanyone “point to any actual conduct or activity on [his] part which\ncould be termed ‘improper.’ ” ___ W. Va., at ___–___, ___\nS. E. 2d, at ___–___; App. 655a–656a. In other words, based on\nthe facts presented by Caperton, Justice Benjamin conducted a\nprobing search into his actual motives and inclinations; and he\nfound none to be improper. We do not question his subjective\nfindings of impartiality and propriety. Nor do we determine whether\nthere was actual bias. Following accepted principles of our legal\ntradition respecting the proper performance of judicial functions,\njudges often inquire into their subjective motives and purposes in\nthe ordinary course of deciding a case. This does not mean the\ninquiry is a simple one. “The work of deciding cases goes on every\nday in hundreds of courts throughout the land. Any judge, one might\nsuppose, would find it easy to describe the process which he had\nfollowed a thousand times and more. Nothing could be farther from\nthe truth.” B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 9\n(1921). The judge inquires into reasons that seem to\nbe leading to a particular result. Precedent and stare\ndecisis and the text and purpose of the law and the\nConstitution; logic and scholarship and experience and common\nsense; and fairness and disinterest and neutrality are among the\nfactors at work. To bring coherence to the process, and to seek\nrespect for the resulting judgment, judges often explain the\nreasons for their conclusions and rulings. There are instances when\nthe introspection that often attends this process may reveal that\nwhat the judge had assumed to be a proper, controlling factor is\nnot the real one at work. If the judge discovers that some personal\nbias or improper consideration seems to be the actuating cause of\nthe decision or to be an influence so difficult to dispel that\nthere is a real possibility of undermining neutrality, the judge\nmay think it necessary to consider withdrawing from the case. The difficulties of inquiring into actual\nbias, and the fact that the inquiry is often a private one, simply\nunderscore the need for objective rules. Otherwise there may be no\nadequate protection against a judge who simply misreads or\nmisapprehends the real motives at work in deciding the case. The\njudge’s own inquiry into actual bias, then, is not one that the law\ncan easily superintend or review, though actual bias, if disclosed,\nno doubt would be grounds for appropriate relief. In lieu of\nexclusive reliance on that personal inquiry, or on appellate review\nof the judge’s determination respecting actual bia",

HULTEEN et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the ninth circuit No. 07–543. Argued December 10, 2008—Decided May\n18, 2009 Petitioner companies (collectively, AT&T) long\nbased pension calculations on a seniority system that relied on\nyears of service minus uncredited leave time, giving less\nretirement credit for pregnancy absences than for medical leave\ngenerally. In response to the ruling in General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert , 429 U. S. 125 , that such\ndifferential treatment of pregnancy leave was not sex-based\ndiscrimination prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, Congress added the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) to\nTitle VII in 1978 to make it “clear that it is discriminatory to\ntreat pregnancy-related conditions less favorably than other\nmedical conditions,” Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock\nCo. v. EEOC , 462 U. S. 669 , 684. On\nthe PDA’s effective date, AT&T replaced its old plan with the\nAnticipated Disability Plan, which provided the same service credit\nfor pregnancy leave as for other disabilities prospectively, but\ndid not make any retroactive adjustments for the pre-PDA personnel\npolicies. Each of the individual respondents therefore received\nless service credit for her pre-PDA pregnancy leave than she would\nhave for general disability leave, resulting in a reduction in her\ntotal employment term and, consequently, smaller AT&T pensions.\nThey, along with their union, also a respondent, filed Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission charges alleging discrimination\nbased on sex and pregnancy in violation of Title VII. The EEOC\nissued each respondent (collectively, Hulteen) a determination\nletter finding reasonable cause to believe AT&T had\ndiscriminated and a right-to-sue letter. Hulteen filed suit in the\nDistrict Court, which held itself bound by a Ninth Circuit\nprecedent finding a Title VII violation where post-PDA retirement\neligibility calculations incorporated pre-PDA accrual rules that\ndifferentiated based on pregnancy. The Circuit affirmed. Held: An employer does not\nnecessarily violate the PDA when it pays pension benefits\ncalculated in part under an accrual rule, applied only pre-PDA,\nthat gave less retirement credit for pregnancy than for medical\nleave generally. Because AT&T’s pension payments accord with a\nbona fide seniority system’s terms, they are insulated from\nchallenge under Title VII §703(h). Pp. 4–14. (a) AT&T’s benefit\ncalculation rule is protected by §703(h), which provides: “[I]t\nshall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to\napply different standards of compensation … pursuant to a bona fide\nseniority … system … provided that such differences are not the\nresult of an intention to discriminate because of … sex.” In Teamsters v. United States , 431 U. S. 324 , 356, the\nCourt held that a pre-Title VII seniority system that\ndisproportionately advantaged white, as against minority, employees\nnevertheless exemplified a bona fide system without any\ndiscriminatory terms under §703(h), where the discrimination\nresulted from the employer’s hiring practices and job assignments.\nBecause AT&T’s system must also be viewed as bona fide, i.e., as a system having no discriminatory terms, §703(h)\ncontrols the result here, just as it did in Teamsters .\nThis Court held in Gilbert that an accrual rule limiting\nthe seniority credit for time taken for pregnancy leave did not\nunlawfully discriminate on the basis of sex. As a matter of law, at\nthat time, “an exclusion of pregnancy from a disability-benefits\nplan providing general coverage [was] not a gender-based\ndiscrimination at all.” 429 U. S., at 136. The only way to conclude\nthat §703(h) does not protect AT&T’s system would be to read\nthe PDA as applying retroactively to recharacterize AT&T’s acts\nas having been illegal when done. This is not a serious\npossibility. Generally, there is “a presumption against\nretroactivity [unless] Congress itself has affirmatively considered\nthe potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined\nthat it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing\nbenefits.” Landgraf v. USI Film Products , 511 U. S. 244 ,\n272–273. There is no such clear intent here. Section\n706(e)(2)—which details when “an unlawful employment practice\noccurs, with respect to a seniority system that has been adopted\nfor an intentionally discriminatory purpose”—has no application\nbecause Gilbert unquestionably held that the feature of\nAT&T’s seniority system at issue here was not discriminatory\nwhen adopted, let alone intentionally so. Nor can it be argued that\nbecause AT&T could have chosen to give post-PDA credit to\npre-PDA pregnancy leave when Hulteen retired, its failure to do so\nwas facially discriminatory at that time. If a choice to rely on a\nfavorable statute turned every past differentiation into\ncontemporary discrimination, §703(h) would never apply. Finally, Bazemore v. Friday , 478 U. S. 385 —in which a\npre-Title VII compensation plan giving black employees less pay\nthan whites was held to violate Title VII on its effective date—is\ninapplicable because the Bazemore plan did not involve a\nseniority system subject to §703(h) and the employer there failed\nto eliminate the discriminatory practice when Title VII became law.\nPp. 4–13. (b) A recent §706(e) amendment making it\n“an unlawful employment practice … when an individual is affected\nby application of a discriminatory compensation decision or other\npractice, including each time … benefits [are] paid, resulting …\nfrom such a decision,” §3(A), 123 Stat. 6, does not help Hulteen.\nAT&T’s pre-PDA decision not to award Hulteen service credit for\npregnancy leave was not discriminatory, with the consequence that\nHulteen has not been “affected by application of a discriminatory\ncompensation decision or other practice.” Pp. 13–14. 498 F. 3d 1001, reversed. Souter, J., delivered the opinion\nof the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Stevens, Scalia,\nKennedy, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., filed a\nconcurring opinion. Ginsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in\nwhich Breyer, J., joined. OPINION OF THE COURT AT&T CORP. V. HULTEEN 556 U. S. ____ (2009) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 07-543 AT&T CORPORATION, PETITIONER v. NOREEN\nHULTEEN et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit [May 18, 2009] Justice Souter delivered the\nopinion of the Court. The question is whether an\nemployer necessarily violates the Pregnancy Discrimination Act\n(PDA), 42 U. S. C. §2000e(k), when it pays pension benefits\ncalculated in part under an accrual rule, applied only prior to the\nPDA, that gave less retirement credit for pregnancy leave than for\nmedical leave generally. We hold there is no necessary violation;\nand the benefit calculation rule in this case is part of a bona\nfide seniority system under §703(h) of Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(h), which insulates\nit from challenge. I Since 1914, AT&T Corporation\n(then American Telephone & Telegraph Company) and its Bell\nSystem Operating Companies, including Pacific Telephone and\nTelegraph Company (hereinafter, collectively, AT&T),[ Footnote 1 ] have provided pensions and\nother benefits based on a seniority system that relies upon an\nemployee’s term of employment, understood as the period of service\nat the company minus uncredited leave time.[ Footnote 2 ] In the 1960s and early to\nmid-1970s, AT&T employees on “disability” leave got full\nservice credit for the entire periods of absence, but those who\ntook “personal” leaves of absence received maximum service credit\nof 30 days. Leave for pregnancy was treated as personal, not\ndisability. AT&T altered this practice in 1977 by adopting its\nMaternity Payment Plan (MPP), entitling pregnant employees to\ndisability benefits and service credit for up to six weeks of\nleave. If the absence went beyond six weeks, however, it was\ntreated as personal leave, with no further benefits or credit,\nwhereas employees out on disability unrelated to pregnancy\ncontinued to receive full service credit for the duration of\nabsence. This differential treatment of pregnancy leave, under both\nthe pre-1977 plan and the MPP, was lawful: in General Elec.\nCo. v. Gilbert , 429 U. S. 125 (1976), this Court\nconcluded that a disability benefit plan excluding disabilities\nrelated to pregnancy was not sex-based discrimination within the\nmeaning of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253,\nas amended, 42 U. S. C. §2000e et seq . In 1978, Congress amended Title VII by passing\nthe PDA, 92 Stat. 2076, 42 U. S. C. §2000e(k), which\nsuperseded Gilbert so as to make it “clear that it is\ndiscriminatory to treat pregnancy-related conditions less favorably\nthan other medical conditions.” Newport News Shipbuilding &\nDry Dock Co. v. EEOC , 462 U. S. 669 , 684\n(1983). On April 29, 1979, the effective date of the PDA, AT&T\nadopted its Anticipated Disability Plan which replaced the MPP and\nprovided service credit for pregnancy leave on the same basis as\nleave taken for other temporary disabilities. AT&T did not,\nhowever, make any retroactive adjustments to the service credit\ncalculations of women who had been subject to the pre-PDA personnel\npolicies. Four of those women are named respondents in\nthis case. Each of them received less service credit for pregnancy\nleave than she would have accrued on the same leave for disability:\nseven months less for Noreen Hulteen; about six months for Eleanora\nCollet; and about two for Elizabeth Snyder and Linda Porter.\nRespondents Hulteen, Collet, and Snyder have retired from AT&T;\nrespondent Porter has yet to. If her total term of employment had\nnot been decreased due to her pregnancy leave, each would be\nentitled to a greater pension benefit. Eventually, each of the individual respondents\nand respondent Communications Workers of America (CWA), the\ncollective-bargaining representative for the majority of AT&T’s\nnonmanagement employees, filed charges of discrimination with the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging\ndiscrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy in violation of\nTitle VII. In 1998, the EEOC issued a Letter of Determination\nfinding reasonable cause to believe that AT&T had discriminated\nagainst respondent Hulteen and “a class of other similarly-situated\nfemale employees whose adjusted [commencement of service] date has\nbeen used to determine eligibility for a service or disability\npension, the amount of pension benefits, and eligibility for\ncertain other benefits and programs, including early retirement\nofferings.” App. 54–55. The EEOC issued a notice of right to sue to\neach named respondent and the CWA (collectively, Hulteen), and\nHulteen filed suit in the United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of California. On dueling motions for summary judgment, the\nDistrict Court held itself bound by a prior Ninth Circuit decision, Pallas v. Pacific Bell , 940 F. 2d 1324\n(1991), which found a Title VII violation where post-PDA retirement\neligibility calculations incorporated pre-PDA accrual rules that\ndifferentiated on the basis of pregnancy. See App. to Pet. for\nCert. 121a–122a. The Circuit, en banc, affirmed and held that Pallas ’s conclusion that “calculation of service credit\nexcluding time spent on pregnancy leave violates Title VII was, and\nis, correct.” 498 F. 3d 1001, 1003 (2007). The Ninth Circuit’s decision directly\nconflicts with the holdings of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits that\nreliance on a pre-PDA differential accrual rule to determine\npension benefits does not constitute a current violation of Title\nVII. See Ameritech Benefit Plan Comm . v. Communication\nWorkers of Am. , 220 F. 3d 814 (CA7 2000) (finding no\nactionable Title VII violation given the existence of a bona fide\nseniority system); Leffman v. Sprint Corp ., 481\nF. 3d 428 (CA6 2007) (characterizing claim as challenging the\ncontinuing effects of past discrimination rather than alleging a\ncurrent Title VII violation). We granted certiorari in order to\nresolve this split, 554 U. S. __ (2008), and now reverse the\njudgment of the Ninth Circuit. II Title VII makes it an “unlawful\nemployment practice” for an employer “to discriminate against any\nindividual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment, because of such individual’s … sex.” 42\nU. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1). Generally, a claim under Title VII\nmust be filed “within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged\nunlawful employment practice occurred,” §2000e–5(e)(1). In this\ncase, Hulteen has identified the challenged practice as applying\nthe terms of AT&T’s seniority system to calculate and pay\npension benefits to women who took pregnancy leaves before April\n29, 1979. She says the claim is timely because the old service\ncredit differential for pregnancy leave was carried forward through\nthe system’s calculations so as to produce an effect in the amount\nof the benefit when payments began. There is no question that the\npayment of pension benefits in this case is a function of a\nseniority system, given the fact that calculating benefits under\nthe pension plan depends in part on an employee’s term of\nemployment. As we have said, “[a] ‘seniority system’ is a scheme\nthat, alone or in tandem with non-‘seniority’ criteria, allots to\nemployees ever improving employment rights and benefits as their\nrelative lengths of pertinent employment increase.” California\nBrewers Assn. v. Bryant , 444 U. S. 598 , 605–606\n(1980) (footnote omitted). Hulteen is also undoubtedly correct that\nAT&T’s personnel policies affecting the calculation of any\nemployee’s start date should be considered “ancillary rules” and\nelements of the system, necessary for it to operate at all, being\nrules that “define which passages of time will ‘count’ towards the\naccrual of seniority and which will not.” Id. , at 607. But contrary to Hulteen’s position,\nestablishing the continuity of a seniority system whose results\ndepend in part on obsolete rules entailing disadvantage to\nonce-pregnant employees does not resolve this case. Although\nadopting a service credit rule unfavorable to those out on\npregnancy leave would violate Title VII today, a seniority system\ndoes not necessarily violate the statute when it gives current\neffect to such rules that operated before the PDA. “[S]eniority\nsystems are afforded special treatment under Title VII,” Trans\nWorld Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison , 432 U. S. 63 , 81 (1977),\nreflecting Congress’s understanding that their stability is\nvaluable in its own right. Hence, §703(h): “Notwithstanding any other provision of this\nsubchapter, it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an\nemployer to apply different standards of compensation, or different\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment pursuant to a bona\nfide seniority … system … provided that such differences are not\nthe result of an intention to discriminate because of race, color,\nreligion, sex, or national origin … .” 42 U. S. C.\n§2000e–2(h). Benefit differentials produced by a bona fide\nseniority-based pension plan are permitted unless they are “the\nresult of an intention to discriminate.” Ibid .[ Footnote 3 ] In Teamsters v. United\nStates , 431 U.\nS. 324 (1977), advantages of a seniority system flowed\ndisproportionately to white, as against minority, employees,\nbecause of an employer’s prior discrimination in job assignments.\nWe recognized that this “disproportionate distribution of\nadvantages does in a very real sense operate to freeze the status\nquo of prior discriminatory employment practices[,] [b]ut both the\nliteral terms of §703(h) and the legislative history of Title VII\ndemonstrate that Congress considered this very effect of many\nseniority systems and extended a measure of immunity to them.” Id. , at 350 (internal quotation marks omitted). “[T]he\nunmistakable purpose of §703(h) was to make clear that the routine\napplication of a bona fide seniority system would not be unlawful\nunder Title VII.” Id ., at 352. The seniority system in Teamsters exemplified a bona fide system without any\ndiscriminatory terms (the discrimination having occurred in\nexecutive action hiring employees and assigning jobs), so that the\nCourt could conclude that the system “did not have its genesis in …\ndiscrimination, and … has been maintained free from any illegal\npurpose.” Id. , at 356. AT&T’s system must also be viewed as bona\nfide, that is, as a system that has no discriminatory terms, with\nthe consequence that subsection (h) controls the result here, just\nas in Teamsters . It is true that in this case the\npre-April 29, 1979 rule of differential treatment was an element of\nthe seniority system itself; but it did not taint the system under\nthe terms of subsection (h), because this Court held in Gilbert that an accrual rule limiting the seniority credit\nfor time taken for pregnancy leave did not unlawfully discriminate\non the basis of sex. As a matter of law, at that time, “an\nexclusion of pregnancy from a disability-benefits plan providing\ngeneral coverage [was] not a gender-based discrimination at all.”\n429 U. S., at 136.[ Footnote 4 ]\nAlthough the PDA would have made it discriminatory to continue the\naccrual policies of the old rule, AT&T amended that rule as of\nthe effective date of the Act, April 29, 1979; the new one,\ntreating pregnancy and other temporary disabilities the same way,\nremains a part of AT&T’s seniority system today. This account of litigation, legislation, and\nthe evolution of the system’s terms is the answer to Hulteen’s\nargument that Teamsters supports her position. She\ncorrectly points out that a “seniority system that perpetuates the\neffects of pre-Act discrimination cannot be bona fide if an intent\nto discriminate entered into its very adoption,” 431 U. S., at 346,\nn. 28, and she would characterize AT&T’s seniority system as\nintentionally discriminatory, on the theory that the accrual rule\nfor pregnancy leave was facially discriminatory from the start. She\nclaims further support from Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc. , 499 U. S. 187 (1991), in\nwhich we said that “explicit facial discrimination does not depend\non why the employer discriminates but rather on the explicit terms\nof the discrimination,” and that such facial discrimination is\nintentional discrimination even if not based on any underlying\nmalevolence. Id. , at 199. Hulteen accordingly claims that\nthe superseded differential affecting current benefits was, and\nremains, “discriminatory in precisely the way the PDA prohibits,”\nBrief for Respondents 18. But Automobile Workers is not on\npoint. The policy in that case, prohibiting women from working in\njobs with lead exposure unless they could show themselves incapable\nof child bearing, was put in place after the PDA became law and\nunder its terms was facially discriminatory. In this case, however,\nAT&T’s intent when it adopted the pregnancy leave rule (before\nthe PDA) was to give differential treatment that as a matter of\nlaw, as Gilbert held, was not gender-based discrimination.\nBecause AT&T’s differential accrual rule was therefore a\npermissible differentiation given the law at the time, there was\nnothing in the seniority system at odds with the subsection (h)\nbona fide requirement. The consequence is that subsection (h) is as\napplicable here as it was in Teamsters , and the\ncalculations of credited service that determine pensions are the\nresults of a permissibly different standard under subsection (h)\ntoday.[ Footnote 5 ] The only way to conclude here that the\nsubsection would not support the application of AT&T’s system\nwould be to read the PDA as applying retroactively to\nrecharacterize the acts as having been illegal when done, contra Gilbert .[ Footnote 6 ]\nBut this is not a serious possibility. As we have said, “[b]ecause it accords with widely held intuitions\nabout how statutes ordinarily operate, a presumption against\nretroactivity will generally coincide with legislative and public\nexpectations. Requiring clear intent assures that Congress itself\nhas affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of\nretroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable\nprice to pay for the countervailing benefits.” Landgraf v. USI Film Products , 511 U. S. 244 , 272–273\n(1994). There is no such clear intent here, indeed, no\nindication at all that Congress had retroactive application in\nmind; the evidence points the other way. Congress provided for the\nPDA to take effect on the date of enactment, except in its\napplication to certain benefit programs, as to which effectiveness\nwas held back 180 days. Act of Oct. 31, 1978, §2(b), 92 Stat. 2076,\n42 U. S. C. §2000e(k) (1979 ed.). The House Report adverted to\nthese benefit schemes: “As the Gilbert decision permits employers\nto exclude pregnancy-related coverage from employee benefit plans,\n[the bill] provides for [a] transition period of 180 days to allow\nemployees [sic] to comply with the explicit provisions of\nthis amendment. It is the committee’s intention to provide for an\norderly and equitable transition, with the least disruption for\nemployers and employees, consistent with the purposes of the bill.”\nH. R. Rep. No. 95–948, p. 8 (1978). This is the language of prospective intent, not\nretrospective revision. Hulteen argues that she nonetheless has a\nchallenge to AT&T’s current payment of pension benefits under\n§706(e)(2) of Title VII, believing (again mistakenly) that this\nsubsection affects the validity of any arrangement predating the\nPDA that would be facially discriminatory if instituted today.\nBrief for Respondents 27–29. Section 706(e)(2) provides that “an unlawful employment practice occurs, with\nrespect to a seniority system that has been adopted for an\nintentionally discriminatory purpose in violation of this\nsubchapter (whether or not that discriminatory purpose is apparent\non the face of the seniority provision), when the seniority system\nis adopted, when an individual becomes subject to the seniority\nsystem, or when a person aggrieved is injured by the application of\nthe seniority system or provision of the system.” 42 U. S. C.\n§2000e–5(e)(2). But, as the text makes clear, this subsection\ndetermines the moments at which a seniority system violates Title\nVII only if it is a system “adopted for an intentionally\ndiscriminatory purpose in violation of this subchapter.” As\ndiscussed above, the Court has unquestionably held that the feature\nof AT&T’s seniority system at issue was not discriminatory when\nadopted, let alone intentionally so in violation of this\nsubchapter. That leaves §706(e)(2) without any application\nhere. It is equally unsound for Hulteen to argue\nthat when she retired AT&T could have chosen to give post-PDA\ncredit to pre-PDA pregnancy leave, making its failure to do so\nfacially discriminatory at that time.[ Footnote 7 ] If a choice to rely on a favorable statute\nturned every past differentiation into contemporary discrimination,\nsubsection (h) would never apply. Hulteen’s remaining argument (as of the time\nthe case was submitted to us) is that our decision in Bazemore v. Friday , 478 U. S. 385 (1986) (per curiam) , is on her side. In Bazemore , black\nemployees of the North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service, who\nreceived less pay than comparable whites under a differential\ncompensation plan extending back to pre-Title VII segregation,\nbrought suit in 1971 claiming that pay disparities persisted. Id. , at 389–391. We concluded that “[a] pattern or\npractice that would have constituted a violation of Title VII, but\nfor the fact that the statute had not yet become effective, became\na violation upon Title VII’s effective date, and to the extent an\nemployer continued to engage in that act or practice, it is liable\nunder that statute.” Id. , at 395. Bazemore has nothing to say here. To\nbegin with, it did not involve a seniority system subject to\nsubsection (h); rather, the employer in Bazemore had a\nracially based pay structure under which black employees were paid\nless than white employees. Further, after Title VII became law, the\nemployer failed to eliminate the discriminatory practice, even\nthough the new statute had turned what once was legally permissible\ninto something unlawful. Bazemore would be on point only\nif, after the PDA, AT&T continued to apply an unfavorable\ncredit differential for pregnancy leave simply because it had begun\nto do that before the PDA. AT&T’s system, by contrast, provides\nfuture benefits based on past, completed events, that were entirely\nlawful at the time they occurred. III We have accepted supplemental\nbriefing after the argument on the possible effect on this case of\nthe recent amendment to §706(e) of Title VII, adopted in response\nto Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. , 550 U. S. 618 (2007), and dealing specifically with discrimination in\ncompensation: “For purposes of this section, an unlawful\nemployment practice occurs, with respect to discrimination in\ncompensation in violation of this title, when a discriminatory\ncompensation decision or other practice is adopted, when an\nindividual becomes subject to a discriminatory compensation\ndecision or other practice, or when an individual is affected by\napplication of a discriminatory compensation decision or other\npractice, including each time wages, benefits, or other\ncompensation is paid, resulting in whole or in part from such a\ndecision or other practice.” Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009,\nPub. L. 111–2, §3(A), 123 Stat. 5–6. Hulteen argues that payment of the pension benefits\nat issue in this case marks the moment at which she “is affected by\napplication of a discriminatory compensation decision or other\npractice,” and she reads the statute as providing that such a\n“decision or other practice” may not be applied to her\ndisadvantage. But the answer to this claim is essentially\nthe same as the answer to Hulteen’s argument that §706(e)(2) helps\nher, supra , at 11–12. For the reasons already discussed,\nAT&T’s pre-PDA decision not to award Hulteen service credit for\npregnancy leave was not discriminatory, with the consequence that\nHulteen has not been “affected by application of a discriminatory\ncompensation decision or other practice.” §3(A), 123 Stat. 6. IV Bona fide seniority systems\nallow, among other things, for predictable financial consequences,\nboth for the employer who pays the bill and for the employee who\ngets the benefit. Cf . Central Laborers’ Pension Fund v. Heinz , 541\nU. S. 739 , 743 (2004) (noting that the central feature of the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U. S. C.\n§1001 et seq. , is its “object of protecting employees’\njustified expectations of receiving the benefits their employers\npromise them”). As §703(h) demonstrates, Congress recognized the\nsalience of these reliance interests and, where not based upon or\nresulting from an intention to discriminate, gave them protection.\nBecause the seniority system run by AT&T is bona fide, the\njudgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is\nreversed. It is so ordered. Footnote 1 In 1982, a consent decree and Modified Final\nJudgment (MFJ) were entered to resolve the Government’s antitrust\nsuit against American Telephone & Telegraph Company. The MFJ\nresulted in the break-up of American Telephone & Telegraph and\nthe divestiture of the local Bell System Operating Companies,\nincluding Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company (PT&T). Many\nemployees of the former Bell System Operating Companies became\nemployees of the new AT&T Corporation. The Plan of\nReorganization, approved by the United States District Court for\nthe District of Columbia, United States v. Western\nElec. Co. , 569 F. Supp. 1057, aff’d sub nom . California v. United\nStates , 464 U.\nS. 1013 (1983), provided that “all employees will carry with\nthem all pre-divestiture Bell System service regardless of the\norganizational unit or corporation by which they are employed\nimmediately after divestiture.” App. 54. Respondents in this case\nwere employed at PT&T. After the divestiture of the Bell\nOperating Companies in 1984, these women became employees of\nAT&T Corporation and their service calculations, as computed by\nPT&T under its accrual rules, were carried over to AT&T\nCorporation. Footnote 2 AT&T’s calculation of a term of\nemployment is a more complicated endeavor, requiring the creation\nand maintenance of an individual “start date” for each employee,\nwhich is adjusted based on the relevant leave policy. Footnote 3 Section 701(k) of Title VII provides that\n“women affected by pregnancy, … shall be treated the same for all\nemployment-related purposes, including receipt of benefits under\nfringe benefit programs, as other persons not so affected but\nsimilar in their ability or inability to work, and nothing in\nsection [703(h)] of this title shall be interpreted to permit\notherwise.” 42 U. S. C. §2000e(k). Hulteen contends that, in\nlight of this language, §703(h) does not apply at all to claims of\nfringe-benefit discrimination under the PDA. We cannot agree.\nHulteen’s reading would result in the odd scenario that pregnancy\ndiscrimination, alone among all categories of discrimination (race,\ncolor, religion, other sex-based claims, and national origin),\nwould receive dispensation from the general application of\nsubsection (h). A better explanation is that §701(k) refers\nonly to the final sentence of §703(h), which reads that “[i]t shall\nnot be an unlawful employment practice under this subchapter for\nany employer to differentiate upon the basis of sex in determining\nthe amount of the wages or compensation paid or to be paid to\nemployees of such employer if such differentiation is authorized by\nthe provisions of section 206(d) of title 29.” 42 U. S. C.\n§2000e–2(h). This final sentence of subsection (h), referred to as\nthe Bennett Amendment, served to reconcile the Equal Pay Act of\n1963, 77 Stat. 56, 29 U. S. C. §206(d), with Title VII. See County of Washington v. Gunther , 452 U. S. 161 , 194\n(1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). In General Elec. Co. v. Gilbert , 429 U. S. 125 (1976), this Court had\nconcluded that the amendment permitted wage discrimination based on\npregnancy. Id. , at 144–145. By adding the language,\n“nothing in section [703(h)] of this title shall be interpreted to\npermit otherwise,” to the PDA, 42 U. S. C. §2000e(k), Congress\nwanted to ensure that, in addition to replacing Gilbert with a rule that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is sex\ndiscrimination, it foreclosed the possibility that this Court’s\ninterpretation of the Bennett Amendment could be construed, going\nforward, to permit wage discrimination based on pregnancy. Footnote 4 Gilbert recognized that differential\ntreatment could still represent intentionally discriminatory\ntreatment if pretextual, 429 U. S., at 136, and that a forbidden\ndiscriminatory effect could result if a disability-benefits plan\nproduced overall preferential treatment for one sex, id .,\nat 138. Neither theory is advanced here. In Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty , 434\nU. S. 136 (1977), we reaffirmed our holding in Gilbert that Title VII “did not require that greater economic benefits be\npaid to one sex or the other ‘because of their differing roles in\n“the scheme of human existence.” ’ ” Id. , at 142\n(quoting Gilbert , supra , at 139, n. 17). But we\nnoted that Gilbert ’s holding did not extend to “permit an\nemployer to burden female employees in such a way as to deprive\nthem of employment opportunities because of their different role.” Satty , supra , at 142 . Cancellation of\nbenefits previously accrued, therefore, was considered facially\nviolative at the time, but such a situation is not presented\nhere. Footnote 5 Although certain circuit courts had\npreviously concluded that treating pregnancy leave less favorably\nthan other disability leave constituted sex discrimination under\nTitle VII, this Court in Gilbert clearly rejected that\nconclusion, 429 U. S., at 147 (Brennan, J., dissenting); see also id. , at 162 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Gilbert declared the meaning and scope of sex discrimination under Title\nVII and held that previous views to the contrary were wrong as a\nmatter of law. And “[a] judicial construction of a statute is an\nauthoritative statement of what the statute meant before as well as\nafter the decision of the case giving rise to that construction.” Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc. , 511 U. S. 298 , 312–313\n(1994); see also id. , at 313, n. 12. It is therefore to no\navail to argue that the pregnancy leave cap was unlawful before Gilbert and that the PDA returned the law to its prior\nstate. Footnote 6 In so saying, we assume that §701(k) has no",

IQBAL et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the second circuit No. 07–1015. Argued December 10, 2008—Decided May\n18, 2009 Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist\nattacks, respondent Iqbal, a Pakistani Muslim, was arrested on\ncriminal charges and detained by federal officials under\nrestrictive conditions. Iqbal filed a Bivens action\nagainst numerous federal officials, including petitioner Ashcroft,\nthe former Attorney General, and petitioner Mueller, the Director\nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). See Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents , 403 U. S. 388 . The\ncomplaint alleged, inter alia, that petitioners designated\nIqbal a person “of high interest” on account of his race, religion,\nor national origin, in contravention of the First and Fifth\nAmendments; that the FBI, under Mueller’s direction, arrested and\ndetained thousands of Arab Muslim men as part of its September-11th\ninvestigation; that petitioners knew of, condoned, and willfully\nand maliciously agreed to subject Iqbal to harsh conditions of\nconfinement as a matter of policy, solely on account of the\nprohibited factors and for no legitimate penological interest; and\nthat Ashcroft was the policy’s “principal architect” and Mueller\nwas “instrumental” in its adoption and execution. After the\nDistrict Court denied petitioners’ motion to dismiss on\nqualified-immunity grounds, they invoked the collateral order\ndoctrine to file an interlocutory appeal in the Second Circuit.\nAffirming, that court assumed without discussion that it had\njurisdiction and focused on the standard set forth in Bell\nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U. S. 544 , for\nevaluating whether a complaint is sufficient to survive a motion to\ndismiss. Concluding that Twombly ’s “flexible plausibility\nstandard” obliging a pleader to amplify a claim with factual\nallegations where necessary to render it plausible was inapplicable\nin the context of petitioners’ appeal, the court held that Iqbal’s\ncomplaint was adequate to allege petitioners’ personal involvement\nin discriminatory decisions which, if true, violated clearly\nestablished constitutional law. Held: 1. The Second Circuit\nhad subject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the District Court’s\norder denying petitioners’ motion to dismiss.\nPp. 6–10. (a) Denial of a\nqualified-immunity claim can fall within the narrow class of\nprejudgment orders reviewable under the collateral-order doctrine\nso long as the order “turns on an issue of law.” Mitchell v. Forsyth , 472 U. S. 511 , 530. The\ndoctrine’s applicability in this context is well established; an\norder rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage\nis a “final decision” under 28 U. S. C. §1291, which vests\ncourts of appeals with “jurisdiction of appeals from all final\ndecisions of the district courts.” Behrens v. Pelletier , 516 U. S. 299 ,\n307 . Pp. 7–8. (b) Under these\nprinciples, the Court of Appeals had, and this Court has,\njurisdiction over the District Court’s order. Because the order\nturned on an issue of law and rejected the qualified-immunity\ndefense, it was a final decision “subject to immediate appeal.” Behrens, supra, at 307 . Pp. 8–10. 2. Iqbal’s complaint fails to plead\nsufficient facts to state a claim for purposeful and unlawful\ndiscrimination. Pp. 11–23. (a) This Court assumes,\nwithout deciding, that Iqbal’s First Amendment claim is actionable\nin a Bivens action, see Hartman v. Moore, 547\nU. S. 250 , 254, n. 2. Because vicarious liability is\ninapplicable to Bivens and §1983 suits, see, e.g.,\nMonell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs. , 436 U. S. 658 ,\n691, the plaintiff in a suit such as the present one must plead\nthat each Government-official defendant, through his own individual\nactions, has violated the Constitution. Purposeful discrimination\nrequires more than “intent as volition or intent as awareness of\nconsequences”; it involves a decisionmaker’s undertaking a course\nof action “ ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ [the\naction’s] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney , 442 U. S. 256 ,\n279. Iqbal must plead sufficient factual matter to show that\npetitioners adopted and implemented the detention policies at issue\nnot for a neutral, investigative reason, but for the purpose of\ndiscriminating on account of race, religion, or national origin.\nPp. 11–13. (b) Under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain a “short and\nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled\nto relief.” “[D]etailed factual allegations” are not required, Twombly, 550 U. S., at 555, but the Rule does call for\nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to “state a claim to\nrelief that is plausible on its face,” id. , at 570. A\nclaim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content\nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. Id., at\n556. Two working principles underlie Twombly. First, the\ntenet that a court must accept a complaint’s allegations as true is\ninapplicable to threadbare recitals of a cause of action’s\nelements, supported by mere conclusory statements. Id., at\n555. Second, determining whether a complaint states a plausible\nclaim is context-specific, requiring the reviewing court to draw on\nits experience and common sense. Id., at 556. A court\nconsidering a motion to dismiss may begin by identifying\nallegations that, because they are mere conclusions, are not\nentitled to the assumption of truth. While legal conclusions can\nprovide the complaint’s framework, they must be supported by\nfactual allegations. When there are well-pleaded factual\nallegations, a court should assume their veracity and then\ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to\nrelief. Pp. 13–16. (c) Iqbal’s pleadings\ndo not comply with Rule 8 under Twombly. Several of his\nallegations—that petitioners agreed to subject him to harsh\nconditions as a matter of policy, solely on account of\ndiscriminatory factors and for no legitimate penological interest;\nthat Ashcroft was that policy’s “principal architect”; and that\nMueller was “instrumental” in its adoption and execution—are\nconclusory and not entitled to be assumed true. Moreover, the\nfactual allegations that the FBI, under Mueller, arrested and\ndetained thousands of Arab Muslim men, and that he and Ashcroft\napproved the detention policy, do not plausibly suggest that\npetitioners purposefully discriminated on prohibited grounds. Given\nthat the September 11 attacks were perpetrated by Arab Muslims, it\nis not surprising that a legitimate policy directing law\nenforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their\nsuspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental\nimpact on Arab Muslims, even though the policy’s purpose was to\ntarget neither Arabs nor Muslims. Even if the complaint’s\nwell-pleaded facts gave rise to a plausible inference that Iqbal’s\narrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that\ninference alone would not entitle him to relief: His claims against\npetitioners rest solely on their ostensible policy of holding\ndetainees categorized as “of high interest,” but the complaint does\nnot contain facts plausibly showing that their policy was based on\ndiscriminatory factors. Pp. 16–20. (d) Three of Iqbal’s\narguments are rejected. Pp. 20–23. (i) His\nclaim that Twombly should be limited to its antitrust\ncontext is not supported by that case or the Federal Rules. Because Twombly interpreted and applied Rule 8, which in turn\ngoverns the pleading standard “in all civil actions,” Rule 1, the\ncase applies to antitrust and discrimination suits alike, see 550\nU. S., at 555–556, and n. 14. P. 20. (ii) Rule\n8’s pleading requirements need not be relaxed based on the Second\nCircuit’s instruction that the District Court cabin discovery to\npreserve petitioners’ qualified-immunity defense in anticipation of\na summary judgment motion. The question presented by a motion to\ndismiss for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls\nplaced on the discovery process. Twombly , supra ,\nat 559. And because Iqbal’s complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he\nis not entitled to discovery, cabined or otherwise.\nPp. 20–22. (iii) Rule\n9(b)—which requires particularity when pleading “fraud or mistake”\nbut allows “other conditions of a person’s mind [to] be alleged\ngenerally”—does not require courts to credit a complaint’s\nconclusory statements without reference to its factual context.\nRule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent\nunder an elevated pleading standard. It does not give him license\nto evade Rule 8’s less rigid, though still operative, strictures.\nPp. 22–23. (e) The Second Circuit\nshould decide in the first instance whether to remand to the\nDistrict Court to allow Iqbal to seek leave to amend his deficient\ncomplaint. P. 23. 490 F. 3d 143, reversed and remanded. Kennedy, J., delivered the\nopinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Scalia,\nThomas, and Alito, JJ., joined. Souter, J., filed a dissenting\nopinion, in which Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.\nBreyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion. OPINION OF THE COURT ASHCROFT V. IQBAL 556 U. S. ____ (2009) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 07-1015 JOHN D. ASHCROFT, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL,\net al., PETITIONERS v. JAVAID IQBAL et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit [May 18, 2009] Justice Kennedy delivered the\nopinion of the Court. Respondent Javaid Iqbal is a\ncitizen of Pakistan and a Muslim. In the wake of the September 11,\n2001, terrorist attacks he was arrested in the United States on\ncriminal charges and detained by federal officials. Respondent\nclaims he was deprived of various constitutional protections while\nin federal custody. To redress the alleged deprivations, respondent\nfiled a complaint against numerous federal officials, including\nJohn Ashcroft, the former Attorney General of the United States,\nand Robert Mueller, the Director of the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI). Ashcroft and Mueller are the petitioners in\nthe case now before us. As to these two petitioners, the complaint\nalleges that they adopted an unconstitutional policy that subjected\nrespondent to harsh conditions of confinement on account of his\nrace, religion, or national origin. In the District Court petitioners raised the\ndefense of qualified immunity and moved to dismiss the suit,\ncontending the complaint was not sufficient to state a claim\nagainst them. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss,\nconcluding the complaint was sufficient to state a claim despite\npetitioners’ official status at the times in question. Petitioners\nbrought an interlocutory appeal in the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit. The court, without discussion, assumed it had\njurisdiction over the order denying the motion to dismiss; and it\naffirmed the District Court’s decision. Respondent’s account of his prison ordeal\ncould, if proved, demonstrate unconstitutional misconduct by some\ngovernmental actors. But the allegations and pleadings with respect\nto these actors are not before us here. This case instead turns on\na narrower question: Did respondent, as the plaintiff in the\nDistrict Court, plead factual matter that, if taken as true, states\na claim that petitioners deprived him of his clearly established\nconstitutional rights. We hold respondent’s pleadings are\ninsufficient. I Following the 2001 attacks, the\nFBI and other entities within the Department of Justice began an\ninvestigation of vast reach to identify the assailants and prevent\nthem from attacking anew. The FBI dedicated more than 4,000 special\nagents and 3,000 support personnel to the endeavor. By September 18\n“the FBI had received more than 96,000 tips or potential leads from\nthe public.” Dept. of Justice, Office of Inspector General, The\nSeptember 11 Detainees: A Review of the Treatment of Aliens Held on\nImmigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation of the\nSeptember 11 Attacks 1, 11–12 (Apr. 2003) (hereinafter OIG Report),\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/\n0306/full.pdf?bcsi_scan_61073EC0F74759AD=0&bcsi_scan_filename=full.pdf\n(as visited May 14, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court’s case\nfile). In the ensuing months the FBI\nquestioned more than 1,000 people with suspected links to the\nattacks in particular or to terrorism in general. Id. , at\n1. Of those individuals, some 762 were held on immigration charges;\nand a 184-member subset of that group was deemed to be “of ‘high\ninterest’ ” to the investigation. Id., at 111. The\nhigh-interest detainees were held under restrictive conditions\ndesigned to prevent them from communicating with the general prison\npopulation or the outside world. Id., at 112–113. Respondent was one of the detainees. According\nto his complaint, in November 2001 agents of the FBI and\nImmigration and Naturalization Service arrested him on charges of\nfraud in relation to identification documents and conspiracy to\ndefraud the United States. Iqbal v. Hasty, 490\nF. 3d 143, 147–148 (CA2 2007). Pending trial for those crimes,\nrespondent was housed at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in\nBrooklyn, New York. Respondent was designated a person “of high\ninterest” to the September 11 investigation and in January 2002 was\nplaced in a section of the MDC known as the Administrative Maximum\nSpecial Housing Unit (ADMAX SHU). Id., at 148. As the\nfacility’s name indicates, the ADMAX SHU incorporates the maximum\nsecurity conditions allowable under Federal Bureau of Prison\nregulations. Ibid. ADMAX SHU detainees were kept in\nlockdown 23 hours a day, spending the remaining hour outside their\ncells in handcuffs and leg irons accompanied by a four-officer\nescort. Ibid. Respondent pleaded guilty to the criminal\ncharges, served a term of imprisonment, and was removed to his\nnative Pakistan. Id., at 149. He then filed a Bivens action in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of New York against 34 current and former federal\nofficials and 19 “John Doe” federal corrections officers. See Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents , 403 U. S. 388 (1971). The defendants range from the correctional officers who had\nday-to-day contact with respondent during the term of his\nconfinement, to the wardens of the MDC facility, all the way to\npetitioners—officials who were at the highest level of the federal\nlaw enforcement hierarchy. First Amended Complaint in No.\n04–CV–1809 (JG)(JA), ¶¶1011, App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a\n(hereinafter Complaint). The 21-cause-of-action complaint does not\nchallenge respondent’s arrest or his confinement in the MDC’s\ngeneral prison population. Rather, it concentrates on his treatment\nwhile confined to the ADMAX SHU. The complaint sets forth various\nclaims against defendants who are not before us. For instance, the\ncomplaint alleges that respondent’s jailors “kicked him in the\nstomach, punched him in the face, and dragged him across” his cell\nwithout justification, id., ¶113, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n176a; subjected him to serial strip and body-cavity searches when\nhe posed no safety risk to himself or others, id., ¶¶143–145, App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a; and refused to let him and\nother Muslims pray because there would be “[n]o prayers for\nterrorists,” id., ¶154, App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a. The allegations against petitioners are the\nonly ones relevant here. The complaint contends that petitioners\ndesignated respondent a person of high interest on account of his\nrace, religion, or national origin, in contravention of the First\nand Fifth Amendments to the Constitution. The complaint alleges\nthat “the [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested\nand detained thousands of Arab Muslim men … as part of its\ninvestigation of the events of September 11.” Id., ¶47, at\n164a. It further alleges that “[t]he policy of holding\npost-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of\nconfinement until they were ‘cleared’ by the FBI was approved by\nDefendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after\nSeptember 11, 2001.” Id., ¶69, at 168a. Lastly, the\ncomplaint posits that petitioners “each knew of, condoned, and\nwillfully and maliciously agreed to subject” respondent to harsh\nconditions of confinement “as a matter of policy, solely on account\nof [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no\nlegitimate penological interest.” Id., ¶96, at 172a–173a.\nThe pleading names Ashcroft as the “principal architect” of the\npolicy, id., ¶10, at 157a, and identifies Mueller as\n“instrumental in [its] adoption, promulgation, and implementation.” Id., ¶11, at 157a. Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for\nfailure to state sufficient allegations to show their own\ninvolvement in clearly established unconstitutional conduct. The\nDistrict Court denied their motion. Accepting all of the\nallegations in respondent’s complaint as true, the court held that\n“it cannot be said that there [is] no set of facts on which\n[respondent] would be entitled to relief as against” petitioners. Id., at 136a–137a (relying on Conley v. Gibson , 355\nU. S. 41 (1957)). Invoking the collateral-order doctrine\npetitioners filed an interlocutory appeal in the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit. While that appeal was\npending, this Court decided Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U. S. 544 (2007), which discussed\nthe standard for evaluating whether a complaint is sufficient to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss. The Court of Appeals considered Twombly’ s applicability to this case. Acknowledging that Twombly retired the Conley no-set-of-facts test\nrelied upon by the District Court, the Court of Appeals’ opinion\ndiscussed at length how to apply this Court’s “standard for\nassessing the adequacy of pleadings.” 490 F. 3d, at 155. It\nconcluded that Twombly called for a “flexible\n‘plausibility standard,’ which obliges a pleader to amplify a claim\nwith some factual allegations in those contexts where such\namplification is needed to render the claim plausible. ” Id., at 157–158. The court found that petitioners’ appeal\ndid not present one of “those contexts” requiring amplification. As\na consequence, it held respondent’s pleading adequate to allege\npetitioners’ personal involvement in discriminatory decisions\nwhich, if true, violated clearly established constitutional law. Id., at 174. Judge Cabranes concurred. He agreed that the\nmajority’s “discussion of the relevant pleading standards\nreflect[ed] the uneasy compromise … between a qualified immunity\nprivilege rooted in the need to preserve the effectiveness of\ngovernment as contemplated by our constitutional structure and the\npleading requirements of Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.” Id., at 178 (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted). Judge Cabranes nonetheless expressed concern at\nthe prospect of subjecting high-ranking Government\nofficials—entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity and\ncharged with responding to “a national and international security\nemergency unprecedented in the history of the American Republic”—to\nthe burdens of discovery on the basis of a complaint as nonspecific\nas respondent’s. Id., at 179. Reluctant to vindicate that\nconcern as a member of the Court of Appeals, ibid., Judge\nCabranes urged this Court to address the appropriate pleading\nstandard “at the earliest opportunity.” Id., at 178. We\ngranted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), and now reverse. II We first address whether the\nCourt of Appeals had subject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the\nDistrict Court’s order denying petitioners’ motion to dismiss.\nRespondent disputed subject-matter jurisdiction in the Court of\nAppeals, but the court hardly discussed the issue. We are not free\nto pretermit the question. Subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be\nforfeited or waived and should be considered when fairly in doubt. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp. , 546 U. S. 500 , 514\n(2006) (citing United States v. Cotton , 535 U. S. 625 , 630\n(2002)). According to respondent, the District Court’s order\ndenying petitioners’ motion to dismiss is not appealable under the\ncollateral-order doctrine. We disagree. A With exceptions inapplicable\nhere, Congress has vested the courts of appeals with “jurisdiction\nof appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the\nUnited States.” 28 U. S. C. §1291. Though the statute’s\nfinality requirement ensures that “interlocutory appeals—appeals\nbefore the end of district court proceedings—are the exception, not\nthe rule,” Johnson v. Jones , 515 U. S. 304 , 309 (1995), it does not\nprevent “review of all prejudgment orders.” Behrens v. Pelletier , 516 U. S. 299 , 305\n(1996). Under the collateral-order doctrine a limited set of\ndistrict-court orders are reviewable “though short of final\njudgment.” Ibid. The orders within this narrow category\n“are immediately appealable because they ‘finally determine claims\nof right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the\naction, too important to be denied review and too independent of\nthe cause itself to require that appellate consideration be\ndeferred until the whole case is adjudicated.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial\nLoan Corp., 337\nU. S. 541 , 546 (1949)). A district-court decision denying\na Government officer’s claim of qualified immunity can fall within\nthe narrow class of appealable orders despite “the absence of a\nfinal judgment.” Mitchell v. Forsyth , 472 U. S. 511 , 530\n(1985). This is so because qualified immunity—which shields\nGovernment officials “from liability for civil damages insofar as\ntheir conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights,” Harlow v. Fitzgerald , 457 U. S. 800 ,\n818 (1982)—is both a defense to liability and a limited\n“entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of\nlitigation.” Mitchell , supra , 472 U. S., at 526.\nProvided it “turns on an issue of law,” id. , at 530, a\ndistrict-court order denying qualified immunity\n“ ‘conclusively determine[s]’ ” that the defendant must\nbear the burdens of discovery; is “conceptually distinct from the\nmerits of the plaintiff’s claim”; and would prove “effectively\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” Id. , at\n527528 (citing Cohen, supra, at 546). As a general matter,\nthe collateral-order doctrine may have expanded beyond the limits\ndictated by its internal logic and the strict application of the\ncriteria set out in Cohen . But the applicability of the\ndoctrine in the context of qualified-immunity claims is well\nestablished; and this Court has been careful to say that a district\ncourt’s order rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss\nstage of a proceeding is a “final decision” within the meaning of\n§1291. Behrens, 516 U. S., at 307 . B Applying these principles, we\nconclude that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to hear\npetitioners’ appeal. The District Court’s order denying\npetitioners’ motion to dismiss turned on an issue of law and\nrejected the defense of qualified immunity. It was therefore a\nfinal decision “subject to immediate appeal.” Ibid . Respondent\nsays that “a qualified immunity appeal based solely on the\ncomplaint’s failure to state a claim, and not on the ultimate\nissues relevant to the qualified immunity defense itself, is not a\nproper subject of interlocutory jurisdiction.” Brief for Respondent\nIqbal 15 (hereinafter Iqbal Brief). In other words, respondent\ncontends the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to determine whether\nhis complaint avers a clearly established constitutional violation\nbut that it lacked jurisdiction to pass on the sufficiency of his\npleadings. Our opinions, however, make clear that appellate\njurisdiction is not so strictly confined. In Hartman v. Moore , 547 U. S. 250 (2006),\nthe Court reviewed an interlocutory decision denying qualified\nimmunity. The legal issue decided in Hartman concerned the\nelements a plaintiff “must plead and prove in order to win” a First\nAmendment retaliation claim. Id., at 257, n. 5.\nSimilarly, two Terms ago in Wilkie v. Robbins , 551 U. S. 537 (2007), the Court considered another interlocutory order denying\nqualified immunity. The legal issue there was whether a Bivens action can be employed to challenge interference\nwith property rights. 551 U. S., at 549, n. 4. These cases\ncannot be squared with respondent’s argument that the\ncollateral-order doctrine restricts appellate jurisdiction to the\n“ultimate issu[e]” whether the legal wrong asserted was a violation\nof clearly established law while excluding the question whether the\nfacts pleaded establish such a violation. Iqbal Brief 15. Indeed,\nthe latter question is even more clearly within the category of\nappealable decisions than the questions presented in Hartman and Wilkie , since whether a particular\ncomplaint sufficiently alleges a clearly established violation of\nlaw cannot be decided in isolation from the facts pleaded. In that\nsense the sufficiency of respondent’s pleadings is both\n“inextricably intertwined with,” Swint v. Chambers\nCounty Comm’n , 514 U. S. 35 , 51 (1995),\nand “directly implicated by,” Hartman, supra , at 257,\nn. 5, the qualified immunity defense. Respondent counters that our holding in Johnson , 515 U. S. 304 , confirms the want of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction here. That is incorrect. The allegation\nin Johnson was that five defendants, all of them police\nofficers, unlawfully beat the plaintiff. Johnson considered “the appealability of a portion of” the District Court’s\nsummary judgment order that, “though entered in a ‘qualified\nimmunity’ case, determine[d] only” that there was a genuine issue\nof material fact that three of the defendants participated in the\nbeating. Id., at 313. In finding that order not a “final decision”\nfor purposes of §1291, the Johnson Court cited Mitchell for the proposition that only decisions turning\n“ ‘ on an issue of law ’ ” are subject to\nimmediate appeal. 515 U. S., at 313 . Though determining\nwhether there is a genuine issue of material fact at summary\njudgment is a question of law, it is a legal question that sits\nnear the law-fact divide. Or as we said in Johnson , it is\na “fact-related” legal inquiry. Id., at 314. To conduct\nit, a court of appeals may be required to consult a “vast pretrial\nrecord, with numerous conflicting affidavits, depositions, and\nother discovery materials.” Id., at 316. That process\ngenerally involves matters more within a district court’s ken and\nmay replicate inefficiently questions that will arise on appeal\nfollowing final judgment. Ibid. Finding those concerns\npredominant, Johnson held that the collateral orders that\nare “final” under Mitchell turn on “abstract,” rather than\n“fact-based,” issues of law. 515 U. S., at 317. The concerns that animated the decision in Johnson are absent when an appellate court considers the\ndisposition of a motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient\npleadings. True, the categories of “fact-based” and “abstract”\nlegal questions used to guide the Court’s decision in Johnson are not well defined. Here, however, the order\ndenying petitioners’ motion to dismiss falls well within the latter\nclass. Reviewing that order, the Court of Appeals considered only\nthe allegations contained within the four corners of respondent’s\ncomplaint; resort to a “vast pretrial record” on petitioners’\nmotion to dismiss was unnecessary. Id., at 316. And\ndetermining whether respondent’s complaint has the “heft” to state\na claim is a task well within an appellate court’s core competency. Twombly, 550 U. S., at 557. Evaluating the sufficiency of\na complaint is not a “fact-based” question of law, so the problem\nthe Court sought to avoid in Johnson is not implicated\nhere. The District Court’s order denying petitioners’ motion to\ndismiss is a final decision under the collateral-order doctrine\nover which the Court of Appeals had, and this Court has,\njurisdiction. We proceed to consider the merits of petitioners’\nappeal. III In Twombly, supra, at\n553–554, the Court found it necessary first to discuss the\nantitrust principles implicated by the complaint. Here too we begin\nby taking note of the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a\nclaim of unconstitutional discrimination against officials entitled\nto assert the defense of qualified immunity. In Bivens —proceeding on\nthe theory that a right suggests a remedy—this Court “recognized\nfor the first time an implied private action for damages against\nfederal officers alleged to have violated a citizen’s\nconstitutional rights.” Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko , 534\nU. S. 61 , 66 (2001). Because implied causes of action are\ndisfavored, the Court has been reluctant to extend Bivens liability “to any new context or new category of defendants.” 534\nU. S., at 68. See also Wilkie , 551 U. S., at\n549 –550. That reluctance might well have disposed of\nrespondent’s First Amendment claim of religious discrimination. For\nwhile we have allowed a Bivens action to redress a\nviolation of the equal protection component of the Due Process\nClause of the Fifth Amendment, see Davis v. Passman , 442 U. S. 228 (1979), we\nhave not found an implied damages remedy under the Free Exercise\nClause. Indeed, we have declined to extend Bivens to a\nclaim sounding in the First Amendment. Bush v. Lucas , 462\nU. S. 367 (1983). Petitioners do not press this argument,\nhowever, so we assume, without deciding, that respondent’s First\nAmendment claim is actionable under Bivens . In the limited settings where Bivens does apply, the implied cause of action is the “federal analog to\nsuits brought against state officials under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U.\nS. C. §1983.” Hartman , 547 U. S., at 254, n. 2.\nCf. Wilson v. Layne , 526 U. S. 603 , 609\n(1999). Based on the rules our precedents establish, respondent\ncorrectly concedes that Government officials may not be held liable\nfor the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a\ntheory of respondeat superior. Iqbal Brief 46 (“[I]t is\nundisputed that supervisory Bivens liability cannot be\nestablished solely on a theory of respondeat superior ”).\nSee Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social\nServs. , 436 U.\nS. 658 , 691 (1978) (finding no vicarious liability for a\nmunicipal “person” under 42 U. S. C. §1983); see also Dunlop v. Munroe , 7 Cranch 242, 269 (1812) (a\nfederal official’s liability “will only result from his own neglect\nin not properly superintending the discharge” of his subordinates’\nduties); Robertson v. Sichel , 127 U. S. 507 , 515–516\n(1888) (“A public officer or agent is not responsible for the\nmisfeasances or position wrongs, or for the nonfeasances, or\nnegligences, or omissions of duty, of the subagents or servants or\nother persons properly employed by or under him, in the discharge\nof his official duties”). Because vicarious liability is\ninapplicable to Bivens and §1983 suits, a plaintiff must\nplead that each Government-official defendant, through the\nofficial’s own individual actions, has violated the\nConstitution. The factors necessary to establish a Bivens violation will vary with the constitutional\nprovision at issue. Where the claim is invidious discrimination in\ncontravention of the First and Fifth Amendments, our decisions make\nclear that the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant\nacted with discriminatory purpose. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,\nInc. v. Hialeah , 508 U. S. 520 , 540–541\n(1993) (First Amendment); Washington v. Davis , 426 U. S. 229 ,\n240 (1976) (Fifth Amendment). Under extant precedent purposeful\ndiscrimination requires more than “intent as volition or intent as\nawareness of consequences.” Personnel Administrator of\nMass. v. Feeney , 442 U. S. 256 , 279\n(1979). It instead involves a decisionmaker’s undertaking a course\nof action “ ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ [the\naction’s] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” Ibid. It follows that, to state a claim based on a\nviolation of a clearly established right, respondent must plead\nsufficient factual matter to show that petitioners adopted and\nimplemented the detention policies at issue not for a neutral,\ninvestigative reason but for the purpose of discriminating on\naccount of race, religion, or national origin. Respondent disagrees. He argues that, under a\ntheory of “supervisory liability,” petitioners can be liable for\n“knowledge and acquiescence in their subordinates’ use of\ndiscriminatory criteria to make classification decisions among\ndetainees.” Iqbal Brief 45–46. That is to say, respondent believes\na supervisor’s mere knowledge of his subordinate’s discriminatory\npurpose amounts ",
    "textpassage": "\"Given that the September 11 attacks were perpetrated by Arab Muslims, it is not surprising that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the policy’s purpose was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims.\""

IQBAL et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the second circuit No. 07–1015. Argued December 10, 2008—Decided May\n18, 2009 Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist\nattacks, respondent Iqbal, a Pakistani Muslim, was arrested on\ncriminal charges and detained by federal officials under\nrestrictive conditions. Iqbal filed a Bivens action\nagainst numerous federal officials, including petitioner Ashcroft,\nthe former Attorney General, and petitioner Mueller, the Director\nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). See Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents , 403 U. S. 388 . The\ncomplaint alleged, inter alia, that petitioners designated\nIqbal a person “of high interest” on account of his race, religion,\nor national origin, in contravention of the First and Fifth\nAmendments; that the FBI, under Mueller’s direction, arrested and\ndetained thousands of Arab Muslim men as part of its September-11th\ninvestigation; that petitioners knew of, condoned, and willfully\nand maliciously agreed to subject Iqbal to harsh conditions of\nconfinement as a matter of policy, solely on account of the\nprohibited factors and for no legitimate penological interest; and\nthat Ashcroft was the policy’s “principal architect” and Mueller\nwas “instrumental” in its adoption and execution. After the\nDistrict Court denied petitioners’ motion to dismiss on\nqualified-immunity grounds, they invoked the collateral order\ndoctrine to file an interlocutory appeal in the Second Circuit.\nAffirming, that court assumed without discussion that it had\njurisdiction and focused on the standard set forth in Bell\nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U. S. 544 , for\nevaluating whether a complaint is sufficient to survive a motion to\ndismiss. Concluding that Twombly ’s “flexible plausibility\nstandard” obliging a pleader to amplify a claim with factual\nallegations where necessary to render it plausible was inapplicable\nin the context of petitioners’ appeal, the court held that Iqbal’s\ncomplaint was adequate to allege petitioners’ personal involvement\nin discriminatory decisions which, if true, violated clearly\nestablished constitutional law. Held: 1. The Second Circuit\nhad subject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the District Court’s\norder denying petitioners’ motion to dismiss.\nPp. 6–10. (a) Denial of a\nqualified-immunity claim can fall within the narrow class of\nprejudgment orders reviewable under the collateral-order doctrine\nso long as the order “turns on an issue of law.” Mitchell v. Forsyth , 472 U. S. 511 , 530. The\ndoctrine’s applicability in this context is well established; an\norder rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage\nis a “final decision” under 28 U. S. C. §1291, which vests\ncourts of appeals with “jurisdiction of appeals from all final\ndecisions of the district courts.” Behrens v. Pelletier , 516 U. S. 299 ,\n307 . Pp. 7–8. (b) Under these\nprinciples, the Court of Appeals had, and this Court has,\njurisdiction over the District Court’s order. Because the order\nturned on an issue of law and rejected the qualified-immunity\ndefense, it was a final decision “subject to immediate appeal.” Behrens, supra, at 307 . Pp. 8–10. 2. Iqbal’s complaint fails to plead\nsufficient facts to state a claim for purposeful and unlawful\ndiscrimination. Pp. 11–23. (a) This Court assumes,\nwithout deciding, that Iqbal’s First Amendment claim is actionable\nin a Bivens action, see Hartman v. Moore, 547\nU. S. 250 , 254, n. 2. Because vicarious liability is\ninapplicable to Bivens and §1983 suits, see, e.g.,\nMonell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs. , 436 U. S. 658 ,\n691, the plaintiff in a suit such as the present one must plead\nthat each Government-official defendant, through his own individual\nactions, has violated the Constitution. Purposeful discrimination\nrequires more than “intent as volition or intent as awareness of\nconsequences”; it involves a decisionmaker’s undertaking a course\nof action “ ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ [the\naction’s] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney , 442 U. S. 256 ,\n279. Iqbal must plead sufficient factual matter to show that\npetitioners adopted and implemented the detention policies at issue\nnot for a neutral, investigative reason, but for the purpose of\ndiscriminating on account of race, religion, or national origin.\nPp. 11–13. (b) Under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain a “short and\nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled\nto relief.” “[D]etailed factual allegations” are not required, Twombly, 550 U. S., at 555, but the Rule does call for\nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to “state a claim to\nrelief that is plausible on its face,” id. , at 570. A\nclaim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content\nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. Id., at\n556. Two working principles underlie Twombly. First, the\ntenet that a court must accept a complaint’s allegations as true is\ninapplicable to threadbare recitals of a cause of action’s\nelements, supported by mere conclusory statements. Id., at\n555. Second, determining whether a complaint states a plausible\nclaim is context-specific, requiring the reviewing court to draw on\nits experience and common sense. Id., at 556. A court\nconsidering a motion to dismiss may begin by identifying\nallegations that, because they are mere conclusions, are not\nentitled to the assumption of truth. While legal conclusions can\nprovide the complaint’s framework, they must be supported by\nfactual allegations. When there are well-pleaded factual\nallegations, a court should assume their veracity and then\ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to\nrelief. Pp. 13–16. (c) Iqbal’s pleadings\ndo not comply with Rule 8 under Twombly. Several of his\nallegations—that petitioners agreed to subject him to harsh\nconditions as a matter of policy, solely on account of\ndiscriminatory factors and for no legitimate penological interest;\nthat Ashcroft was that policy’s “principal architect”; and that\nMueller was “instrumental” in its adoption and execution—are\nconclusory and not entitled to be assumed true. Moreover, the\nfactual allegations that the FBI, under Mueller, arrested and\ndetained thousands of Arab Muslim men, and that he and Ashcroft\napproved the detention policy, do not plausibly suggest that\npetitioners purposefully discriminated on prohibited grounds. Given\nthat the September 11 attacks were perpetrated by Arab Muslims, it\nis not surprising that a legitimate policy directing law\nenforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their\nsuspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental\nimpact on Arab Muslims, even though the policy’s purpose was to\ntarget neither Arabs nor Muslims. Even if the complaint’s\nwell-pleaded facts gave rise to a plausible inference that Iqbal’s\narrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that\ninference alone would not entitle him to relief: His claims against\npetitioners rest solely on their ostensible policy of holding\ndetainees categorized as “of high interest,” but the complaint does\nnot contain facts plausibly showing that their policy was based on\ndiscriminatory factors. Pp. 16–20. (d) Three of Iqbal’s\narguments are rejected. Pp. 20–23. (i) His\nclaim that Twombly should be limited to its antitrust\ncontext is not supported by that case or the Federal Rules. Because Twombly interpreted and applied Rule 8, which in turn\ngoverns the pleading standard “in all civil actions,” Rule 1, the\ncase applies to antitrust and discrimination suits alike, see 550\nU. S., at 555–556, and n. 14. P. 20. (ii) Rule\n8’s pleading requirements need not be relaxed based on the Second\nCircuit’s instruction that the District Court cabin discovery to\npreserve petitioners’ qualified-immunity defense in anticipation of\na summary judgment motion. The question presented by a motion to\ndismiss for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls\nplaced on the discovery process. Twombly , supra ,\nat 559. And because Iqbal’s complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he\nis not entitled to discovery, cabined or otherwise.\nPp. 20–22. (iii) Rule\n9(b)—which requires particularity when pleading “fraud or mistake”\nbut allows “other conditions of a person’s mind [to] be alleged\ngenerally”—does not require courts to credit a complaint’s\nconclusory statements without reference to its factual context.\nRule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent\nunder an elevated pleading standard. It does not give him license\nto evade Rule 8’s less rigid, though still operative, strictures.\nPp. 22–23. (e) The Second Circuit\nshould decide in the first instance whether to remand to the\nDistrict Court to allow Iqbal to seek leave to amend his deficient\ncomplaint. P. 23. 490 F. 3d 143, reversed and remanded. Kennedy, J., delivered the\nopinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Scalia,\nThomas, and Alito, JJ., joined. Souter, J., filed a dissenting\nopinion, in which Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.\nBreyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion. OPINION OF THE COURT ASHCROFT V. IQBAL 556 U. S. ____ (2009) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 07-1015 JOHN D. ASHCROFT, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL,\net al., PETITIONERS v. JAVAID IQBAL et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit [May 18, 2009] Justice Kennedy delivered the\nopinion of the Court. Respondent Javaid Iqbal is a\ncitizen of Pakistan and a Muslim. In the wake of the September 11,\n2001, terrorist attacks he was arrested in the United States on\ncriminal charges and detained by federal officials. Respondent\nclaims he was deprived of various constitutional protections while\nin federal custody. To redress the alleged deprivations, respondent\nfiled a complaint against numerous federal officials, including\nJohn Ashcroft, the former Attorney General of the United States,\nand Robert Mueller, the Director of the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI). Ashcroft and Mueller are the petitioners in\nthe case now before us. As to these two petitioners, the complaint\nalleges that they adopted an unconstitutional policy that subjected\nrespondent to harsh conditions of confinement on account of his\nrace, religion, or national origin. In the District Court petitioners raised the\ndefense of qualified immunity and moved to dismiss the suit,\ncontending the complaint was not sufficient to state a claim\nagainst them. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss,\nconcluding the complaint was sufficient to state a claim despite\npetitioners’ official status at the times in question. Petitioners\nbrought an interlocutory appeal in the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit. The court, without discussion, assumed it had\njurisdiction over the order denying the motion to dismiss; and it\naffirmed the District Court’s decision. Respondent’s account of his prison ordeal\ncould, if proved, demonstrate unconstitutional misconduct by some\ngovernmental actors. But the allegations and pleadings with respect\nto these actors are not before us here. This case instead turns on\na narrower question: Did respondent, as the plaintiff in the\nDistrict Court, plead factual matter that, if taken as true, states\na claim that petitioners deprived him of his clearly established\nconstitutional rights. We hold respondent’s pleadings are\ninsufficient. I Following the 2001 attacks, the\nFBI and other entities within the Department of Justice began an\ninvestigation of vast reach to identify the assailants and prevent\nthem from attacking anew. The FBI dedicated more than 4,000 special\nagents and 3,000 support personnel to the endeavor. By September 18\n“the FBI had received more than 96,000 tips or potential leads from\nthe public.” Dept. of Justice, Office of Inspector General, The\nSeptember 11 Detainees: A Review of the Treatment of Aliens Held on\nImmigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation of the\nSeptember 11 Attacks 1, 11–12 (Apr. 2003) (hereinafter OIG Report),\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/\n0306/full.pdf?bcsi_scan_61073EC0F74759AD=0&bcsi_scan_filename=full.pdf\n(as visited May 14, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court’s case\nfile). In the ensuing months the FBI\nquestioned more than 1,000 people with suspected links to the\nattacks in particular or to terrorism in general. Id. , at\n1. Of those individuals, some 762 were held on immigration charges;\nand a 184-member subset of that group was deemed to be “of ‘high\ninterest’ ” to the investigation. Id., at 111. The\nhigh-interest detainees were held under restrictive conditions\ndesigned to prevent them from communicating with the general prison\npopulation or the outside world. Id., at 112–113. Respondent was one of the detainees. According\nto his complaint, in November 2001 agents of the FBI and\nImmigration and Naturalization Service arrested him on charges of\nfraud in relation to identification documents and conspiracy to\ndefraud the United States. Iqbal v. Hasty, 490\nF. 3d 143, 147–148 (CA2 2007). Pending trial for those crimes,\nrespondent was housed at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in\nBrooklyn, New York. Respondent was designated a person “of high\ninterest” to the September 11 investigation and in January 2002 was\nplaced in a section of the MDC known as the Administrative Maximum\nSpecial Housing Unit (ADMAX SHU). Id., at 148. As the\nfacility’s name indicates, the ADMAX SHU incorporates the maximum\nsecurity conditions allowable under Federal Bureau of Prison\nregulations. Ibid. ADMAX SHU detainees were kept in\nlockdown 23 hours a day, spending the remaining hour outside their\ncells in handcuffs and leg irons accompanied by a four-officer\nescort. Ibid. Respondent pleaded guilty to the criminal\ncharges, served a term of imprisonment, and was removed to his\nnative Pakistan. Id., at 149. He then filed a Bivens action in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of New York against 34 current and former federal\nofficials and 19 “John Doe” federal corrections officers. See Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents , 403 U. S. 388 (1971). The defendants range from the correctional officers who had\nday-to-day contact with respondent during the term of his\nconfinement, to the wardens of the MDC facility, all the way to\npetitioners—officials who were at the highest level of the federal\nlaw enforcement hierarchy. First Amended Complaint in No.\n04–CV–1809 (JG)(JA), ¶¶1011, App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a\n(hereinafter Complaint). The 21-cause-of-action complaint does not\nchallenge respondent’s arrest or his confinement in the MDC’s\ngeneral prison population. Rather, it concentrates on his treatment\nwhile confined to the ADMAX SHU. The complaint sets forth various\nclaims against defendants who are not before us. For instance, the\ncomplaint alleges that respondent’s jailors “kicked him in the\nstomach, punched him in the face, and dragged him across” his cell\nwithout justification, id., ¶113, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n176a; subjected him to serial strip and body-cavity searches when\nhe posed no safety risk to himself or others, id., ¶¶143–145, App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a; and refused to let him and\nother Muslims pray because there would be “[n]o prayers for\nterrorists,” id., ¶154, App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a. The allegations against petitioners are the\nonly ones relevant here. The complaint contends that petitioners\ndesignated respondent a person of high interest on account of his\nrace, religion, or national origin, in contravention of the First\nand Fifth Amendments to the Constitution. The complaint alleges\nthat “the [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested\nand detained thousands of Arab Muslim men … as part of its\ninvestigation of the events of September 11.” Id., ¶47, at\n164a. It further alleges that “[t]he policy of holding\npost-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of\nconfinement until they were ‘cleared’ by the FBI was approved by\nDefendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after\nSeptember 11, 2001.” Id., ¶69, at 168a. Lastly, the\ncomplaint posits that petitioners “each knew of, condoned, and\nwillfully and maliciously agreed to subject” respondent to harsh\nconditions of confinement “as a matter of policy, solely on account\nof [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no\nlegitimate penological interest.” Id., ¶96, at 172a–173a.\nThe pleading names Ashcroft as the “principal architect” of the\npolicy, id., ¶10, at 157a, and identifies Mueller as\n“instrumental in [its] adoption, promulgation, and implementation.” Id., ¶11, at 157a. Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for\nfailure to state sufficient allegations to show their own\ninvolvement in clearly established unconstitutional conduct. The\nDistrict Court denied their motion. Accepting all of the\nallegations in respondent’s complaint as true, the court held that\n“it cannot be said that there [is] no set of facts on which\n[respondent] would be entitled to relief as against” petitioners. Id., at 136a–137a (relying on Conley v. Gibson , 355\nU. S. 41 (1957)). Invoking the collateral-order doctrine\npetitioners filed an interlocutory appeal in the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit. While that appeal was\npending, this Court decided Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U. S. 544 (2007), which discussed\nthe standard for evaluating whether a complaint is sufficient to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss. The Court of Appeals considered Twombly’ s applicability to this case. Acknowledging that Twombly retired the Conley no-set-of-facts test\nrelied upon by the District Court, the Court of Appeals’ opinion\ndiscussed at length how to apply this Court’s “standard for\nassessing the adequacy of pleadings.” 490 F. 3d, at 155. It\nconcluded that Twombly called for a “flexible\n‘plausibility standard,’ which obliges a pleader to amplify a claim\nwith some factual allegations in those contexts where such\namplification is needed to render the claim plausible. ” Id., at 157–158. The court found that petitioners’ appeal\ndid not present one of “those contexts” requiring amplification. As\na consequence, it held respondent’s pleading adequate to allege\npetitioners’ personal involvement in discriminatory decisions\nwhich, if true, violated clearly established constitutional law. Id., at 174. Judge Cabranes concurred. He agreed that the\nmajority’s “discussion of the relevant pleading standards\nreflect[ed] the uneasy compromise … between a qualified immunity\nprivilege rooted in the need to preserve the effectiveness of\ngovernment as contemplated by our constitutional structure and the\npleading requirements of Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.” Id., at 178 (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted). Judge Cabranes nonetheless expressed concern at\nthe prospect of subjecting high-ranking Government\nofficials—entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity and\ncharged with responding to “a national and international security\nemergency unprecedented in the history of the American Republic”—to\nthe burdens of discovery on the basis of a complaint as nonspecific\nas respondent’s. Id., at 179. Reluctant to vindicate that\nconcern as a member of the Court of Appeals, ibid., Judge\nCabranes urged this Court to address the appropriate pleading\nstandard “at the earliest opportunity.” Id., at 178. We\ngranted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), and now reverse. II We first address whether the\nCourt of Appeals had subject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the\nDistrict Court’s order denying petitioners’ motion to dismiss.\nRespondent disputed subject-matter jurisdiction in the Court of\nAppeals, but the court hardly discussed the issue. We are not free\nto pretermit the question. Subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be\nforfeited or waived and should be considered when fairly in doubt. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp. , 546 U. S. 500 , 514\n(2006) (citing United States v. Cotton , 535 U. S. 625 , 630\n(2002)). According to respondent, the District Court’s order\ndenying petitioners’ motion to dismiss is not appealable under the\ncollateral-order doctrine. We disagree. A With exceptions inapplicable\nhere, Congress has vested the courts of appeals with “jurisdiction\nof appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the\nUnited States.” 28 U. S. C. §1291. Though the statute’s\nfinality requirement ensures that “interlocutory appeals—appeals\nbefore the end of district court proceedings—are the exception, not\nthe rule,” Johnson v. Jones , 515 U. S. 304 , 309 (1995), it does not\nprevent “review of all prejudgment orders.” Behrens v. Pelletier , 516 U. S. 299 , 305\n(1996). Under the collateral-order doctrine a limited set of\ndistrict-court orders are reviewable “though short of final\njudgment.” Ibid. The orders within this narrow category\n“are immediately appealable because they ‘finally determine claims\nof right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the\naction, too important to be denied review and too independent of\nthe cause itself to require that appellate consideration be\ndeferred until the whole case is adjudicated.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial\nLoan Corp., 337\nU. S. 541 , 546 (1949)). A district-court decision denying\na Government officer’s claim of qualified immunity can fall within\nthe narrow class of appealable orders despite “the absence of a\nfinal judgment.” Mitchell v. Forsyth , 472 U. S. 511 , 530\n(1985). This is so because qualified immunity—which shields\nGovernment officials “from liability for civil damages insofar as\ntheir conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights,” Harlow v. Fitzgerald , 457 U. S. 800 ,\n818 (1982)—is both a defense to liability and a limited\n“entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of\nlitigation.” Mitchell , supra , 472 U. S., at 526.\nProvided it “turns on an issue of law,” id. , at 530, a\ndistrict-court order denying qualified immunity\n“ ‘conclusively determine[s]’ ” that the defendant must\nbear the burdens of discovery; is “conceptually distinct from the\nmerits of the plaintiff’s claim”; and would prove “effectively\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” Id. , at\n527528 (citing Cohen, supra, at 546). As a general matter,\nthe collateral-order doctrine may have expanded beyond the limits\ndictated by its internal logic and the strict application of the\ncriteria set out in Cohen . But the applicability of the\ndoctrine in the context of qualified-immunity claims is well\nestablished; and this Court has been careful to say that a district\ncourt’s order rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss\nstage of a proceeding is a “final decision” within the meaning of\n§1291. Behrens, 516 U. S., at 307 . B Applying these principles, we\nconclude that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to hear\npetitioners’ appeal. The District Court’s order denying\npetitioners’ motion to dismiss turned on an issue of law and\nrejected the defense of qualified immunity. It was therefore a\nfinal decision “subject to immediate appeal.” Ibid . Respondent\nsays that “a qualified immunity appeal based solely on the\ncomplaint’s failure to state a claim, and not on the ultimate\nissues relevant to the qualified immunity defense itself, is not a\nproper subject of interlocutory jurisdiction.” Brief for Respondent\nIqbal 15 (hereinafter Iqbal Brief). In other words, respondent\ncontends the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to determine whether\nhis complaint avers a clearly established constitutional violation\nbut that it lacked jurisdiction to pass on the sufficiency of his\npleadings. Our opinions, however, make clear that appellate\njurisdiction is not so strictly confined. In Hartman v. Moore , 547 U. S. 250 (2006),\nthe Court reviewed an interlocutory decision denying qualified\nimmunity. The legal issue decided in Hartman concerned the\nelements a plaintiff “must plead and prove in order to win” a First\nAmendment retaliation claim. Id., at 257, n. 5.\nSimilarly, two Terms ago in Wilkie v. Robbins , 551 U. S. 537 (2007), the Court considered another interlocutory order denying\nqualified immunity. The legal issue there was whether a Bivens action can be employed to challenge interference\nwith property rights. 551 U. S., at 549, n. 4. These cases\ncannot be squared with respondent’s argument that the\ncollateral-order doctrine restricts appellate jurisdiction to the\n“ultimate issu[e]” whether the legal wrong asserted was a violation\nof clearly established law while excluding the question whether the\nfacts pleaded establish such a violation. Iqbal Brief 15. Indeed,\nthe latter question is even more clearly within the category of\nappealable decisions than the questions presented in Hartman and Wilkie , since whether a particular\ncomplaint sufficiently alleges a clearly established violation of\nlaw cannot be decided in isolation from the facts pleaded. In that\nsense the sufficiency of respondent’s pleadings is both\n“inextricably intertwined with,” Swint v. Chambers\nCounty Comm’n , 514 U. S. 35 , 51 (1995),\nand “directly implicated by,” Hartman, supra , at 257,\nn. 5, the qualified immunity defense. Respondent counters that our holding in Johnson , 515 U. S. 304 , confirms the want of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction here. That is incorrect. The allegation\nin Johnson was that five defendants, all of them police\nofficers, unlawfully beat the plaintiff. Johnson considered “the appealability of a portion of” the District Court’s\nsummary judgment order that, “though entered in a ‘qualified\nimmunity’ case, determine[d] only” that there was a genuine issue\nof material fact that three of the defendants participated in the\nbeating. Id., at 313. In finding that order not a “final decision”\nfor purposes of §1291, the Johnson Court cited Mitchell for the proposition that only decisions turning\n“ ‘ on an issue of law ’ ” are subject to\nimmediate appeal. 515 U. S., at 313 . Though determining\nwhether there is a genuine issue of material fact at summary\njudgment is a question of law, it is a legal question that sits\nnear the law-fact divide. Or as we said in Johnson , it is\na “fact-related” legal inquiry. Id., at 314. To conduct\nit, a court of appeals may be required to consult a “vast pretrial\nrecord, with numerous conflicting affidavits, depositions, and\nother discovery materials.” Id., at 316. That process\ngenerally involves matters more within a district court’s ken and\nmay replicate inefficiently questions that will arise on appeal\nfollowing final judgment. Ibid. Finding those concerns\npredominant, Johnson held that the collateral orders that\nare “final” under Mitchell turn on “abstract,” rather than\n“fact-based,” issues of law. 515 U. S., at 317. The concerns that animated the decision in Johnson are absent when an appellate court considers the\ndisposition of a motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient\npleadings. True, the categories of “fact-based” and “abstract”\nlegal questions used to guide the Court’s decision in Johnson are not well defined. Here, however, the order\ndenying petitioners’ motion to dismiss falls well within the latter\nclass. Reviewing that order, the Court of Appeals considered only\nthe allegations contained within the four corners of respondent’s\ncomplaint; resort to a “vast pretrial record” on petitioners’\nmotion to dismiss was unnecessary. Id., at 316. And\ndetermining whether respondent’s complaint has the “heft” to state\na claim is a task well within an appellate court’s core competency. Twombly, 550 U. S., at 557. Evaluating the sufficiency of\na complaint is not a “fact-based” question of law, so the problem\nthe Court sought to avoid in Johnson is not implicated\nhere. The District Court’s order denying petitioners’ motion to\ndismiss is a final decision under the collateral-order doctrine\nover which the Court of Appeals had, and this Court has,\njurisdiction. We proceed to consider the merits of petitioners’\nappeal. III In Twombly, supra, at\n553–554, the Court found it necessary first to discuss the\nantitrust principles implicated by the complaint. Here too we begin\nby taking note of the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a\nclaim of unconstitutional discrimination against officials entitled\nto assert the defense of qualified immunity. In Bivens —proceeding on\nthe theory that a right suggests a remedy—this Court “recognized\nfor the first time an implied private action for damages against\nfederal officers alleged to have violated a citizen’s\nconstitutional rights.” Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko , 534\nU. S. 61 , 66 (2001). Because implied causes of action are\ndisfavored, the Court has been reluctant to extend Bivens liability “to any new context or new category of defendants.” 534\nU. S., at 68. See also Wilkie , 551 U. S., at\n549 –550. That reluctance might well have disposed of\nrespondent’s First Amendment claim of religious discrimination. For\nwhile we have allowed a Bivens action to redress a\nviolation of the equal protection component of the Due Process\nClause of the Fifth Amendment, see Davis v. Passman , 442 U. S. 228 (1979), we\nhave not found an implied damages remedy under the Free Exercise\nClause. Indeed, we have declined to extend Bivens to a\nclaim sounding in the First Amendment. Bush v. Lucas , 462\nU. S. 367 (1983). Petitioners do not press this argument,\nhowever, so we assume, without deciding, that respondent’s First\nAmendment claim is actionable under Bivens . In the limited settings where Bivens does apply, the implied cause of action is the “federal analog to\nsuits brought against state officials under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U.\nS. C. §1983.” Hartman , 547 U. S., at 254, n. 2.\nCf. Wilson v. Layne , 526 U. S. 603 , 609\n(1999). Based on the rules our precedents establish, respondent\ncorrectly concedes that Government officials may not be held liable\nfor the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a\ntheory of respondeat superior. Iqbal Brief 46 (“[I]t is\nundisputed that supervisory Bivens liability cannot be\nestablished solely on a theory of respondeat superior ”).\nSee Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social\nServs. , 436 U.\nS. 658 , 691 (1978) (finding no vicarious liability for a\nmunicipal “person” under 42 U. S. C. §1983); see also Dunlop v. Munroe , 7 Cranch 242, 269 (1812) (a\nfederal official’s liability “will only result from his own neglect\nin not properly superintending the discharge” of his subordinates’\nduties); Robertson v. Sichel , 127 U. S. 507 , 515–516\n(1888) (“A public officer or agent is not responsible for the\nmisfeasances or position wrongs, or for the nonfeasances, or\nnegligences, or omissions of duty, of the subagents or servants or\nother persons properly employed by or under him, in the discharge\nof his official duties”). Because vicarious liability is\ninapplicable to Bivens and §1983 suits, a plaintiff must\nplead that each Government-official defendant, through the\nofficial’s own individual actions, has violated the\nConstitution. The factors necessary to establish a Bivens violation will vary with the constitutional\nprovision at issue. Where the claim is invidious discrimination in\ncontravention of the First and Fifth Amendments, our decisions make\nclear that the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant\nacted with discriminatory purpose. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,\nInc. v. Hialeah , 508 U. S. 520 , 540–541\n(1993) (First Amendment); Washington v. Davis , 426 U. S. 229 ,\n240 (1976) (Fifth Amendment). Under extant precedent purposeful\ndiscrimination requires more than “intent as volition or intent as\nawareness of consequences.” Personnel Administrator of\nMass. v. Feeney , 442 U. S. 256 , 279\n(1979). It instead involves a decisionmaker’s undertaking a course\nof action “ ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ [the\naction’s] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” Ibid. It follows that, to state a claim based on a\nviolation of a clearly established right, respondent must plead\nsufficient factual matter to show that petitioners adopted and\nimplemented the detention policies at issue not for a neutral,\ninvestigative reason but for the purpose of discriminating on\naccount of race, religion, or national origin. Respondent disagrees. He argues that, under a\ntheory of “supervisory liability,” petitioners can be liable for\n“knowledge and acquiescence in their subordinates’ use of\ndiscriminatory criteria to make classification decisions among\ndetainees.” Iqbal Brief 45–46. That is to say, respondent believes\na supervisor’s mere knowledge of his subordinate’s discriminatory\npurpose amounts ",
    "textpassage": "\"Given that the September 11 attacks were perpetrated by Arab Muslims, it is not surprising that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the policy’s purpose was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims.\""

IQBAL et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the second circuit No. 07–1015. Argued December 10, 2008—Decided May\n18, 2009 Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist\nattacks, respondent Iqbal, a Pakistani Muslim, was arrested on\ncriminal charges and detained by federal officials under\nrestrictive conditions. Iqbal filed a Bivens action\nagainst numerous federal officials, including petitioner Ashcroft,\nthe former Attorney General, and petitioner Mueller, the Director\nof the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). See Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents , 403 U. S. 388 . The\ncomplaint alleged, inter alia, that petitioners designated\nIqbal a person “of high interest” on account of his race, religion,\nor national origin, in contravention of the First and Fifth\nAmendments; that the FBI, under Mueller’s direction, arrested and\ndetained thousands of Arab Muslim men as part of its September-11th\ninvestigation; that petitioners knew of, condoned, and willfully\nand maliciously agreed to subject Iqbal to harsh conditions of\nconfinement as a matter of policy, solely on account of the\nprohibited factors and for no legitimate penological interest; and\nthat Ashcroft was the policy’s “principal architect” and Mueller\nwas “instrumental” in its adoption and execution. After the\nDistrict Court denied petitioners’ motion to dismiss on\nqualified-immunity grounds, they invoked the collateral order\ndoctrine to file an interlocutory appeal in the Second Circuit.\nAffirming, that court assumed without discussion that it had\njurisdiction and focused on the standard set forth in Bell\nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U. S. 544 , for\nevaluating whether a complaint is sufficient to survive a motion to\ndismiss. Concluding that Twombly ’s “flexible plausibility\nstandard” obliging a pleader to amplify a claim with factual\nallegations where necessary to render it plausible was inapplicable\nin the context of petitioners’ appeal, the court held that Iqbal’s\ncomplaint was adequate to allege petitioners’ personal involvement\nin discriminatory decisions which, if true, violated clearly\nestablished constitutional law. Held: 1. The Second Circuit\nhad subject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the District Court’s\norder denying petitioners’ motion to dismiss.\nPp. 6–10. (a) Denial of a\nqualified-immunity claim can fall within the narrow class of\nprejudgment orders reviewable under the collateral-order doctrine\nso long as the order “turns on an issue of law.” Mitchell v. Forsyth , 472 U. S. 511 , 530. The\ndoctrine’s applicability in this context is well established; an\norder rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage\nis a “final decision” under 28 U. S. C. §1291, which vests\ncourts of appeals with “jurisdiction of appeals from all final\ndecisions of the district courts.” Behrens v. Pelletier , 516 U. S. 299 ,\n307 . Pp. 7–8. (b) Under these\nprinciples, the Court of Appeals had, and this Court has,\njurisdiction over the District Court’s order. Because the order\nturned on an issue of law and rejected the qualified-immunity\ndefense, it was a final decision “subject to immediate appeal.” Behrens, supra, at 307 . Pp. 8–10. 2. Iqbal’s complaint fails to plead\nsufficient facts to state a claim for purposeful and unlawful\ndiscrimination. Pp. 11–23. (a) This Court assumes,\nwithout deciding, that Iqbal’s First Amendment claim is actionable\nin a Bivens action, see Hartman v. Moore, 547\nU. S. 250 , 254, n. 2. Because vicarious liability is\ninapplicable to Bivens and §1983 suits, see, e.g.,\nMonell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs. , 436 U. S. 658 ,\n691, the plaintiff in a suit such as the present one must plead\nthat each Government-official defendant, through his own individual\nactions, has violated the Constitution. Purposeful discrimination\nrequires more than “intent as volition or intent as awareness of\nconsequences”; it involves a decisionmaker’s undertaking a course\nof action “ ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ [the\naction’s] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney , 442 U. S. 256 ,\n279. Iqbal must plead sufficient factual matter to show that\npetitioners adopted and implemented the detention policies at issue\nnot for a neutral, investigative reason, but for the purpose of\ndiscriminating on account of race, religion, or national origin.\nPp. 11–13. (b) Under Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain a “short and\nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled\nto relief.” “[D]etailed factual allegations” are not required, Twombly, 550 U. S., at 555, but the Rule does call for\nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to “state a claim to\nrelief that is plausible on its face,” id. , at 570. A\nclaim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content\nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. Id., at\n556. Two working principles underlie Twombly. First, the\ntenet that a court must accept a complaint’s allegations as true is\ninapplicable to threadbare recitals of a cause of action’s\nelements, supported by mere conclusory statements. Id., at\n555. Second, determining whether a complaint states a plausible\nclaim is context-specific, requiring the reviewing court to draw on\nits experience and common sense. Id., at 556. A court\nconsidering a motion to dismiss may begin by identifying\nallegations that, because they are mere conclusions, are not\nentitled to the assumption of truth. While legal conclusions can\nprovide the complaint’s framework, they must be supported by\nfactual allegations. When there are well-pleaded factual\nallegations, a court should assume their veracity and then\ndetermine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to\nrelief. Pp. 13–16. (c) Iqbal’s pleadings\ndo not comply with Rule 8 under Twombly. Several of his\nallegations—that petitioners agreed to subject him to harsh\nconditions as a matter of policy, solely on account of\ndiscriminatory factors and for no legitimate penological interest;\nthat Ashcroft was that policy’s “principal architect”; and that\nMueller was “instrumental” in its adoption and execution—are\nconclusory and not entitled to be assumed true. Moreover, the\nfactual allegations that the FBI, under Mueller, arrested and\ndetained thousands of Arab Muslim men, and that he and Ashcroft\napproved the detention policy, do not plausibly suggest that\npetitioners purposefully discriminated on prohibited grounds. Given\nthat the September 11 attacks were perpetrated by Arab Muslims, it\nis not surprising that a legitimate policy directing law\nenforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their\nsuspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental\nimpact on Arab Muslims, even though the policy’s purpose was to\ntarget neither Arabs nor Muslims. Even if the complaint’s\nwell-pleaded facts gave rise to a plausible inference that Iqbal’s\narrest was the result of unconstitutional discrimination, that\ninference alone would not entitle him to relief: His claims against\npetitioners rest solely on their ostensible policy of holding\ndetainees categorized as “of high interest,” but the complaint does\nnot contain facts plausibly showing that their policy was based on\ndiscriminatory factors. Pp. 16–20. (d) Three of Iqbal’s\narguments are rejected. Pp. 20–23. (i) His\nclaim that Twombly should be limited to its antitrust\ncontext is not supported by that case or the Federal Rules. Because Twombly interpreted and applied Rule 8, which in turn\ngoverns the pleading standard “in all civil actions,” Rule 1, the\ncase applies to antitrust and discrimination suits alike, see 550\nU. S., at 555–556, and n. 14. P. 20. (ii) Rule\n8’s pleading requirements need not be relaxed based on the Second\nCircuit’s instruction that the District Court cabin discovery to\npreserve petitioners’ qualified-immunity defense in anticipation of\na summary judgment motion. The question presented by a motion to\ndismiss for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls\nplaced on the discovery process. Twombly , supra ,\nat 559. And because Iqbal’s complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he\nis not entitled to discovery, cabined or otherwise.\nPp. 20–22. (iii) Rule\n9(b)—which requires particularity when pleading “fraud or mistake”\nbut allows “other conditions of a person’s mind [to] be alleged\ngenerally”—does not require courts to credit a complaint’s\nconclusory statements without reference to its factual context.\nRule 9 merely excuses a party from pleading discriminatory intent\nunder an elevated pleading standard. It does not give him license\nto evade Rule 8’s less rigid, though still operative, strictures.\nPp. 22–23. (e) The Second Circuit\nshould decide in the first instance whether to remand to the\nDistrict Court to allow Iqbal to seek leave to amend his deficient\ncomplaint. P. 23. 490 F. 3d 143, reversed and remanded. Kennedy, J., delivered the\nopinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Scalia,\nThomas, and Alito, JJ., joined. Souter, J., filed a dissenting\nopinion, in which Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined.\nBreyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion. OPINION OF THE COURT ASHCROFT V. IQBAL 556 U. S. ____ (2009) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 07-1015 JOHN D. ASHCROFT, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL,\net al., PETITIONERS v. JAVAID IQBAL et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit [May 18, 2009] Justice Kennedy delivered the\nopinion of the Court. Respondent Javaid Iqbal is a\ncitizen of Pakistan and a Muslim. In the wake of the September 11,\n2001, terrorist attacks he was arrested in the United States on\ncriminal charges and detained by federal officials. Respondent\nclaims he was deprived of various constitutional protections while\nin federal custody. To redress the alleged deprivations, respondent\nfiled a complaint against numerous federal officials, including\nJohn Ashcroft, the former Attorney General of the United States,\nand Robert Mueller, the Director of the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI). Ashcroft and Mueller are the petitioners in\nthe case now before us. As to these two petitioners, the complaint\nalleges that they adopted an unconstitutional policy that subjected\nrespondent to harsh conditions of confinement on account of his\nrace, religion, or national origin. In the District Court petitioners raised the\ndefense of qualified immunity and moved to dismiss the suit,\ncontending the complaint was not sufficient to state a claim\nagainst them. The District Court denied the motion to dismiss,\nconcluding the complaint was sufficient to state a claim despite\npetitioners’ official status at the times in question. Petitioners\nbrought an interlocutory appeal in the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit. The court, without discussion, assumed it had\njurisdiction over the order denying the motion to dismiss; and it\naffirmed the District Court’s decision. Respondent’s account of his prison ordeal\ncould, if proved, demonstrate unconstitutional misconduct by some\ngovernmental actors. But the allegations and pleadings with respect\nto these actors are not before us here. This case instead turns on\na narrower question: Did respondent, as the plaintiff in the\nDistrict Court, plead factual matter that, if taken as true, states\na claim that petitioners deprived him of his clearly established\nconstitutional rights. We hold respondent’s pleadings are\ninsufficient. I Following the 2001 attacks, the\nFBI and other entities within the Department of Justice began an\ninvestigation of vast reach to identify the assailants and prevent\nthem from attacking anew. The FBI dedicated more than 4,000 special\nagents and 3,000 support personnel to the endeavor. By September 18\n“the FBI had received more than 96,000 tips or potential leads from\nthe public.” Dept. of Justice, Office of Inspector General, The\nSeptember 11 Detainees: A Review of the Treatment of Aliens Held on\nImmigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation of the\nSeptember 11 Attacks 1, 11–12 (Apr. 2003) (hereinafter OIG Report),\nhttp://www.usdoj.gov/oig/special/\n0306/full.pdf?bcsi_scan_61073EC0F74759AD=0&bcsi_scan_filename=full.pdf\n(as visited May 14, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court’s case\nfile). In the ensuing months the FBI\nquestioned more than 1,000 people with suspected links to the\nattacks in particular or to terrorism in general. Id. , at\n1. Of those individuals, some 762 were held on immigration charges;\nand a 184-member subset of that group was deemed to be “of ‘high\ninterest’ ” to the investigation. Id., at 111. The\nhigh-interest detainees were held under restrictive conditions\ndesigned to prevent them from communicating with the general prison\npopulation or the outside world. Id., at 112–113. Respondent was one of the detainees. According\nto his complaint, in November 2001 agents of the FBI and\nImmigration and Naturalization Service arrested him on charges of\nfraud in relation to identification documents and conspiracy to\ndefraud the United States. Iqbal v. Hasty, 490\nF. 3d 143, 147–148 (CA2 2007). Pending trial for those crimes,\nrespondent was housed at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in\nBrooklyn, New York. Respondent was designated a person “of high\ninterest” to the September 11 investigation and in January 2002 was\nplaced in a section of the MDC known as the Administrative Maximum\nSpecial Housing Unit (ADMAX SHU). Id., at 148. As the\nfacility’s name indicates, the ADMAX SHU incorporates the maximum\nsecurity conditions allowable under Federal Bureau of Prison\nregulations. Ibid. ADMAX SHU detainees were kept in\nlockdown 23 hours a day, spending the remaining hour outside their\ncells in handcuffs and leg irons accompanied by a four-officer\nescort. Ibid. Respondent pleaded guilty to the criminal\ncharges, served a term of imprisonment, and was removed to his\nnative Pakistan. Id., at 149. He then filed a Bivens action in the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of New York against 34 current and former federal\nofficials and 19 “John Doe” federal corrections officers. See Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents , 403 U. S. 388 (1971). The defendants range from the correctional officers who had\nday-to-day contact with respondent during the term of his\nconfinement, to the wardens of the MDC facility, all the way to\npetitioners—officials who were at the highest level of the federal\nlaw enforcement hierarchy. First Amended Complaint in No.\n04–CV–1809 (JG)(JA), ¶¶1011, App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a\n(hereinafter Complaint). The 21-cause-of-action complaint does not\nchallenge respondent’s arrest or his confinement in the MDC’s\ngeneral prison population. Rather, it concentrates on his treatment\nwhile confined to the ADMAX SHU. The complaint sets forth various\nclaims against defendants who are not before us. For instance, the\ncomplaint alleges that respondent’s jailors “kicked him in the\nstomach, punched him in the face, and dragged him across” his cell\nwithout justification, id., ¶113, App. to Pet. for Cert.\n176a; subjected him to serial strip and body-cavity searches when\nhe posed no safety risk to himself or others, id., ¶¶143–145, App. to Pet. for Cert. 182a; and refused to let him and\nother Muslims pray because there would be “[n]o prayers for\nterrorists,” id., ¶154, App. to Pet. for Cert. 184a. The allegations against petitioners are the\nonly ones relevant here. The complaint contends that petitioners\ndesignated respondent a person of high interest on account of his\nrace, religion, or national origin, in contravention of the First\nand Fifth Amendments to the Constitution. The complaint alleges\nthat “the [FBI], under the direction of Defendant MUELLER, arrested\nand detained thousands of Arab Muslim men … as part of its\ninvestigation of the events of September 11.” Id., ¶47, at\n164a. It further alleges that “[t]he policy of holding\npost-September-11th detainees in highly restrictive conditions of\nconfinement until they were ‘cleared’ by the FBI was approved by\nDefendants ASHCROFT and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after\nSeptember 11, 2001.” Id., ¶69, at 168a. Lastly, the\ncomplaint posits that petitioners “each knew of, condoned, and\nwillfully and maliciously agreed to subject” respondent to harsh\nconditions of confinement “as a matter of policy, solely on account\nof [his] religion, race, and/or national origin and for no\nlegitimate penological interest.” Id., ¶96, at 172a–173a.\nThe pleading names Ashcroft as the “principal architect” of the\npolicy, id., ¶10, at 157a, and identifies Mueller as\n“instrumental in [its] adoption, promulgation, and implementation.” Id., ¶11, at 157a. Petitioners moved to dismiss the complaint for\nfailure to state sufficient allegations to show their own\ninvolvement in clearly established unconstitutional conduct. The\nDistrict Court denied their motion. Accepting all of the\nallegations in respondent’s complaint as true, the court held that\n“it cannot be said that there [is] no set of facts on which\n[respondent] would be entitled to relief as against” petitioners. Id., at 136a–137a (relying on Conley v. Gibson , 355\nU. S. 41 (1957)). Invoking the collateral-order doctrine\npetitioners filed an interlocutory appeal in the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit. While that appeal was\npending, this Court decided Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U. S. 544 (2007), which discussed\nthe standard for evaluating whether a complaint is sufficient to\nsurvive a motion to dismiss. The Court of Appeals considered Twombly’ s applicability to this case. Acknowledging that Twombly retired the Conley no-set-of-facts test\nrelied upon by the District Court, the Court of Appeals’ opinion\ndiscussed at length how to apply this Court’s “standard for\nassessing the adequacy of pleadings.” 490 F. 3d, at 155. It\nconcluded that Twombly called for a “flexible\n‘plausibility standard,’ which obliges a pleader to amplify a claim\nwith some factual allegations in those contexts where such\namplification is needed to render the claim plausible. ” Id., at 157–158. The court found that petitioners’ appeal\ndid not present one of “those contexts” requiring amplification. As\na consequence, it held respondent’s pleading adequate to allege\npetitioners’ personal involvement in discriminatory decisions\nwhich, if true, violated clearly established constitutional law. Id., at 174. Judge Cabranes concurred. He agreed that the\nmajority’s “discussion of the relevant pleading standards\nreflect[ed] the uneasy compromise … between a qualified immunity\nprivilege rooted in the need to preserve the effectiveness of\ngovernment as contemplated by our constitutional structure and the\npleading requirements of Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.” Id., at 178 (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted). Judge Cabranes nonetheless expressed concern at\nthe prospect of subjecting high-ranking Government\nofficials—entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity and\ncharged with responding to “a national and international security\nemergency unprecedented in the history of the American Republic”—to\nthe burdens of discovery on the basis of a complaint as nonspecific\nas respondent’s. Id., at 179. Reluctant to vindicate that\nconcern as a member of the Court of Appeals, ibid., Judge\nCabranes urged this Court to address the appropriate pleading\nstandard “at the earliest opportunity.” Id., at 178. We\ngranted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), and now reverse. II We first address whether the\nCourt of Appeals had subject-matter jurisdiction to affirm the\nDistrict Court’s order denying petitioners’ motion to dismiss.\nRespondent disputed subject-matter jurisdiction in the Court of\nAppeals, but the court hardly discussed the issue. We are not free\nto pretermit the question. Subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be\nforfeited or waived and should be considered when fairly in doubt. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp. , 546 U. S. 500 , 514\n(2006) (citing United States v. Cotton , 535 U. S. 625 , 630\n(2002)). According to respondent, the District Court’s order\ndenying petitioners’ motion to dismiss is not appealable under the\ncollateral-order doctrine. We disagree. A With exceptions inapplicable\nhere, Congress has vested the courts of appeals with “jurisdiction\nof appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the\nUnited States.” 28 U. S. C. §1291. Though the statute’s\nfinality requirement ensures that “interlocutory appeals—appeals\nbefore the end of district court proceedings—are the exception, not\nthe rule,” Johnson v. Jones , 515 U. S. 304 , 309 (1995), it does not\nprevent “review of all prejudgment orders.” Behrens v. Pelletier , 516 U. S. 299 , 305\n(1996). Under the collateral-order doctrine a limited set of\ndistrict-court orders are reviewable “though short of final\njudgment.” Ibid. The orders within this narrow category\n“are immediately appealable because they ‘finally determine claims\nof right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the\naction, too important to be denied review and too independent of\nthe cause itself to require that appellate consideration be\ndeferred until the whole case is adjudicated.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial\nLoan Corp., 337\nU. S. 541 , 546 (1949)). A district-court decision denying\na Government officer’s claim of qualified immunity can fall within\nthe narrow class of appealable orders despite “the absence of a\nfinal judgment.” Mitchell v. Forsyth , 472 U. S. 511 , 530\n(1985). This is so because qualified immunity—which shields\nGovernment officials “from liability for civil damages insofar as\ntheir conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights,” Harlow v. Fitzgerald , 457 U. S. 800 ,\n818 (1982)—is both a defense to liability and a limited\n“entitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens of\nlitigation.” Mitchell , supra , 472 U. S., at 526.\nProvided it “turns on an issue of law,” id. , at 530, a\ndistrict-court order denying qualified immunity\n“ ‘conclusively determine[s]’ ” that the defendant must\nbear the burdens of discovery; is “conceptually distinct from the\nmerits of the plaintiff’s claim”; and would prove “effectively\nunreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.” Id. , at\n527528 (citing Cohen, supra, at 546). As a general matter,\nthe collateral-order doctrine may have expanded beyond the limits\ndictated by its internal logic and the strict application of the\ncriteria set out in Cohen . But the applicability of the\ndoctrine in the context of qualified-immunity claims is well\nestablished; and this Court has been careful to say that a district\ncourt’s order rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss\nstage of a proceeding is a “final decision” within the meaning of\n§1291. Behrens, 516 U. S., at 307 . B Applying these principles, we\nconclude that the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to hear\npetitioners’ appeal. The District Court’s order denying\npetitioners’ motion to dismiss turned on an issue of law and\nrejected the defense of qualified immunity. It was therefore a\nfinal decision “subject to immediate appeal.” Ibid . Respondent\nsays that “a qualified immunity appeal based solely on the\ncomplaint’s failure to state a claim, and not on the ultimate\nissues relevant to the qualified immunity defense itself, is not a\nproper subject of interlocutory jurisdiction.” Brief for Respondent\nIqbal 15 (hereinafter Iqbal Brief). In other words, respondent\ncontends the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to determine whether\nhis complaint avers a clearly established constitutional violation\nbut that it lacked jurisdiction to pass on the sufficiency of his\npleadings. Our opinions, however, make clear that appellate\njurisdiction is not so strictly confined. In Hartman v. Moore , 547 U. S. 250 (2006),\nthe Court reviewed an interlocutory decision denying qualified\nimmunity. The legal issue decided in Hartman concerned the\nelements a plaintiff “must plead and prove in order to win” a First\nAmendment retaliation claim. Id., at 257, n. 5.\nSimilarly, two Terms ago in Wilkie v. Robbins , 551 U. S. 537 (2007), the Court considered another interlocutory order denying\nqualified immunity. The legal issue there was whether a Bivens action can be employed to challenge interference\nwith property rights. 551 U. S., at 549, n. 4. These cases\ncannot be squared with respondent’s argument that the\ncollateral-order doctrine restricts appellate jurisdiction to the\n“ultimate issu[e]” whether the legal wrong asserted was a violation\nof clearly established law while excluding the question whether the\nfacts pleaded establish such a violation. Iqbal Brief 15. Indeed,\nthe latter question is even more clearly within the category of\nappealable decisions than the questions presented in Hartman and Wilkie , since whether a particular\ncomplaint sufficiently alleges a clearly established violation of\nlaw cannot be decided in isolation from the facts pleaded. In that\nsense the sufficiency of respondent’s pleadings is both\n“inextricably intertwined with,” Swint v. Chambers\nCounty Comm’n , 514 U. S. 35 , 51 (1995),\nand “directly implicated by,” Hartman, supra , at 257,\nn. 5, the qualified immunity defense. Respondent counters that our holding in Johnson , 515 U. S. 304 , confirms the want of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction here. That is incorrect. The allegation\nin Johnson was that five defendants, all of them police\nofficers, unlawfully beat the plaintiff. Johnson considered “the appealability of a portion of” the District Court’s\nsummary judgment order that, “though entered in a ‘qualified\nimmunity’ case, determine[d] only” that there was a genuine issue\nof material fact that three of the defendants participated in the\nbeating. Id., at 313. In finding that order not a “final decision”\nfor purposes of §1291, the Johnson Court cited Mitchell for the proposition that only decisions turning\n“ ‘ on an issue of law ’ ” are subject to\nimmediate appeal. 515 U. S., at 313 . Though determining\nwhether there is a genuine issue of material fact at summary\njudgment is a question of law, it is a legal question that sits\nnear the law-fact divide. Or as we said in Johnson , it is\na “fact-related” legal inquiry. Id., at 314. To conduct\nit, a court of appeals may be required to consult a “vast pretrial\nrecord, with numerous conflicting affidavits, depositions, and\nother discovery materials.” Id., at 316. That process\ngenerally involves matters more within a district court’s ken and\nmay replicate inefficiently questions that will arise on appeal\nfollowing final judgment. Ibid. Finding those concerns\npredominant, Johnson held that the collateral orders that\nare “final” under Mitchell turn on “abstract,” rather than\n“fact-based,” issues of law. 515 U. S., at 317. The concerns that animated the decision in Johnson are absent when an appellate court considers the\ndisposition of a motion to dismiss a complaint for insufficient\npleadings. True, the categories of “fact-based” and “abstract”\nlegal questions used to guide the Court’s decision in Johnson are not well defined. Here, however, the order\ndenying petitioners’ motion to dismiss falls well within the latter\nclass. Reviewing that order, the Court of Appeals considered only\nthe allegations contained within the four corners of respondent’s\ncomplaint; resort to a “vast pretrial record” on petitioners’\nmotion to dismiss was unnecessary. Id., at 316. And\ndetermining whether respondent’s complaint has the “heft” to state\na claim is a task well within an appellate court’s core competency. Twombly, 550 U. S., at 557. Evaluating the sufficiency of\na complaint is not a “fact-based” question of law, so the problem\nthe Court sought to avoid in Johnson is not implicated\nhere. The District Court’s order denying petitioners’ motion to\ndismiss is a final decision under the collateral-order doctrine\nover which the Court of Appeals had, and this Court has,\njurisdiction. We proceed to consider the merits of petitioners’\nappeal. III In Twombly, supra, at\n553–554, the Court found it necessary first to discuss the\nantitrust principles implicated by the complaint. Here too we begin\nby taking note of the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a\nclaim of unconstitutional discrimination against officials entitled\nto assert the defense of qualified immunity. In Bivens —proceeding on\nthe theory that a right suggests a remedy—this Court “recognized\nfor the first time an implied private action for damages against\nfederal officers alleged to have violated a citizen’s\nconstitutional rights.” Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko , 534\nU. S. 61 , 66 (2001). Because implied causes of action are\ndisfavored, the Court has been reluctant to extend Bivens liability “to any new context or new category of defendants.” 534\nU. S., at 68. See also Wilkie , 551 U. S., at\n549 –550. That reluctance might well have disposed of\nrespondent’s First Amendment claim of religious discrimination. For\nwhile we have allowed a Bivens action to redress a\nviolation of the equal protection component of the Due Process\nClause of the Fifth Amendment, see Davis v. Passman , 442 U. S. 228 (1979), we\nhave not found an implied damages remedy under the Free Exercise\nClause. Indeed, we have declined to extend Bivens to a\nclaim sounding in the First Amendment. Bush v. Lucas , 462\nU. S. 367 (1983). Petitioners do not press this argument,\nhowever, so we assume, without deciding, that respondent’s First\nAmendment claim is actionable under Bivens . In the limited settings where Bivens does apply, the implied cause of action is the “federal analog to\nsuits brought against state officials under Rev. Stat. §1979, 42 U.\nS. C. §1983.” Hartman , 547 U. S., at 254, n. 2.\nCf. Wilson v. Layne , 526 U. S. 603 , 609\n(1999). Based on the rules our precedents establish, respondent\ncorrectly concedes that Government officials may not be held liable\nfor the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a\ntheory of respondeat superior. Iqbal Brief 46 (“[I]t is\nundisputed that supervisory Bivens liability cannot be\nestablished solely on a theory of respondeat superior ”).\nSee Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social\nServs. , 436 U.\nS. 658 , 691 (1978) (finding no vicarious liability for a\nmunicipal “person” under 42 U. S. C. §1983); see also Dunlop v. Munroe , 7 Cranch 242, 269 (1812) (a\nfederal official’s liability “will only result from his own neglect\nin not properly superintending the discharge” of his subordinates’\nduties); Robertson v. Sichel , 127 U. S. 507 , 515–516\n(1888) (“A public officer or agent is not responsible for the\nmisfeasances or position wrongs, or for the nonfeasances, or\nnegligences, or omissions of duty, of the subagents or servants or\nother persons properly employed by or under him, in the discharge\nof his official duties”). Because vicarious liability is\ninapplicable to Bivens and §1983 suits, a plaintiff must\nplead that each Government-official defendant, through the\nofficial’s own individual actions, has violated the\nConstitution. The factors necessary to establish a Bivens violation will vary with the constitutional\nprovision at issue. Where the claim is invidious discrimination in\ncontravention of the First and Fifth Amendments, our decisions make\nclear that the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant\nacted with discriminatory purpose. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,\nInc. v. Hialeah , 508 U. S. 520 , 540–541\n(1993) (First Amendment); Washington v. Davis , 426 U. S. 229 ,\n240 (1976) (Fifth Amendment). Under extant precedent purposeful\ndiscrimination requires more than “intent as volition or intent as\nawareness of consequences.” Personnel Administrator of\nMass. v. Feeney , 442 U. S. 256 , 279\n(1979). It instead involves a decisionmaker’s undertaking a course\nof action “ ‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ [the\naction’s] adverse effects upon an identifiable group.” Ibid. It follows that, to state a claim based on a\nviolation of a clearly established right, respondent must plead\nsufficient factual matter to show that petitioners adopted and\nimplemented the detention policies at issue not for a neutral,\ninvestigative reason but for the purpose of discriminating on\naccount of race, religion, or national origin. Respondent disagrees. He argues that, under a\ntheory of “supervisory liability,” petitioners can be liable for\n“knowledge and acquiescence in their subordinates’ use of\ndiscriminatory criteria to make classification decisions among\ndetainees.” Iqbal Brief 45–46. That is to say, respondent believes\na supervisor’s mere knowledge of his subordinate’s discriminatory\npurpose amounts ",
    "textpassage": "\"Given that the September 11 attacks were perpetrated by Arab Muslims, it is not surprising that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to arrest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though the policy’s purpose was to target neither Arabs nor Muslims.\""

MARTINEZ SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOCIETY CHAPTER OF THE UNIVERSITY\nOF CALIFORNIA, HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW, aka HASTINGS CHRISTIAN\nFELLOWSHIP v . MARTINEZ et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the ninth circuit No. 08–1371. Argued April 19, 2010—Decided June 28,\n2010 Respondent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings),\na school within the University of California public-school system,\nextends official recognition to student groups through its\n“Registered Student Organization” (RSO) program. Several benefits\nattend this school-approved status, including the use of school\nfunds, facilities, and channels of communication, as well as\nHastings’ name and logo. In exchange for recognition, RSOs must\nabide by certain conditions. Critical here, all RSOs must comply\nwith the school’s Nondiscrimination Policy, which tracks state law\nbarring discrimination on a number of bases, including religion and\nsexual orientation. Hastings interprets this policy, as it relates\nto the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all comers: RSOs must\nallow any student to participate, become a member, or seek\nleadership positions, regardless of her status or beliefs. At the beginning of the\n2004–2005 academic year, the leaders of an existing Christian RSO\nformed petitioner Christian Legal Society (CLS) by affiliating with\na national Christian association that charters student chapters at\nlaw schools throughout the country. These chapters must adopt\nbylaws that, inter alia , require members and officers to\nsign a “Statement of Faith” and to conduct their lives in accord\nwith prescribed principles. Among those tenets is the belief that\nsexual activity should not occur outside of marriage between a man\nand a woman. CLS interprets its bylaws to exclude from affiliation\nanyone who engages in “unrepentant homosexual conduct” or holds\nreligious convictions different from those in the Statement of\nFaith. Hastings rejected CLS’s application for RSO status on the\nground that the group’s bylaws did not comply with Hastings’\nopen-access policy because they excluded students based on religion\nand sexual orientation. CLS filed this suit for\ninjunctive and declaratory relief under 42 U. S. C. §1983,\nalleging that Hastings’ refusal to grant the group RSO status\nviolated its First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech,\nexpressive association, and free exercise of religion. On\ncross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled for\nHastings. The court held that the all-comers condition on access to\na limited public forum was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral,\nand therefore did not violate CLS’s right to free speech. Nor, in\nthe court’s view, did Hastings impermissibly impair CLS’s right to\nexpressive association: Hastings did not order CLS to admit any\nstudent, nor did the school proscribe any speech; Hastings merely\nplaced conditions on the use of school facilities and\nfunds . The court also rejected CLS’s free exercise\nargument, stating that the Nondiscrimination Policy did not single\nout religious beliefs, but rather was neutral and of general\napplicability. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, ruling that the\nall-comers condition on RSO recognition was reasonable and\nviewpoint neutral. Held : 1. The Court considers only\nwhether a public institution’s conditioning access to a\nstudent-organization forum on compliance with an all-comers policy\nviolates the Constitution. CLS urges the Court to review, instead,\nthe Nondiscrimination Policy as written—prohibiting discrimination\non enumerated bases, including religion and sexual orientation. The\npolicy’s written terms, CLS contends, target solely those groups\nthat organize around religious beliefs or that disapprove of\nparticular sexual behavior, and leave other associations free to\nlimit membership to persons committed to the group’s ideology. This\nargument flatly contradicts the joint stipulation of facts the\nparties submitted at the summary-judgment stage, which specified:\n“Hastings requires that [RSOs] allow any student to participate, …\nregardless of [her] status or beliefs. For example, the Hastings\nDemocratic Caucus cannot bar students holding Republican political\nbeliefs … .” This Court has long recognized that parties are\nbound by, and cannot contradict, their stipulations. See, e.g., Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth , 529 U. S. 217 , 226. The\nCourt therefore rejects CLS’s attempt to escape from the\nstipulation and shift its target to Hastings’ policy as written.\nPp. 8–12. 2. The all-comers policy is a reasonable,\nviewpoint-neutral condition on access to the RSO forum; it\ntherefore does not transgress First Amendment limitations. Pp.\n12–31. (a) The Court’s limited\npublic forum decisions supply the appropriate framework for\nassessing both CLS’s free-speech and expressive-association claims;\nthose decisions recognize that a governmental entity, in regulating\nproperty in its charge, may impose restrictions on speech that are\nreasonable in light of the purposes of the forum and viewpoint\nneutral, e.g., Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of\nUniv. of Va. , 515 U. S. 819 , 829. CLS\nurges the Court to apply to its expressive-association claim a\ndifferent line of cases—decisions in which the Court has rigorously\nreviewed restrictions on associational freedom in the context of\npublic accommodations, e.g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees , 468 U. S. 609 , 623. But,\nbecause CLS’s expressive-association and free-speech arguments\nmerge— who speaks on its behalf, CLS reasons, colors what concept is conveyed—it makes little sense to treat\nthe claims as discrete. Instead, three observations lead the Court\nto analyze CLS’s arguments under limited-public-forum\nprecedents. First, the same considerations that have led\nthe Court to apply a less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech\nin limited public forums, as compared to other environments, apply\nwith equal force to expressive association occurring in a limited\npublic forum. Speech and expressive-association rights are closely\nlinked. See id., at 622. When these intertwined rights\narise in exactly the same context, it would be anomalous for a\nspeech restriction to survive constitutional review under the\nlimited-public-forum test only to be invalidated as an\nimpermissible infringement of expressive association. Second, the\nstrict scrutiny the Court has applied in some settings to laws that\nburden expressive association would, in practical effect,\ninvalidate a defining characteristic of limited public forums—the\nState’s authority to “reserv[e] [them] for certain groups.” Rosenberger , 515 U. S., at 829. Third, this case fits\ncomfortably within the limited-public-forum category, for CLS may\nexclude any person for any reason if it forgoes the benefits of\nofficial recognition. The Court’s expressive-association decisions,\nin contrast, involved regulations that compelled a group\nto include unwanted members, with no choice to opt out. See, e.g., Boy Scouts of America v. Dale , 530 U. S. 640 ,\n648. Application of the less-restrictive limited-public-forum\nanalysis better accounts for the fact that Hastings, through its\nRSO program, is dangling the carrot of subsidy, not wielding the\nstick of prohibition. Pp. 12–17. (b) In three cases,\nthis Court held that public universities had unconstitutionally\nsingled out student groups for disfavored treatment because of\ntheir points of view. See Healy v. James , 408 U. S. 169 ; Widmar v. Vincent , 454 U. S. 263 ; and Rosenberger. Most recently and comprehensively, in Rosenberger , the Court held that a university generally\nmay not withhold benefits from student groups because of their\nreligious outlook. “Once it has opened a limited [public] forum,”\nthe Court emphasized, “the State must respect the lawful boundaries\nit has itself set.” 515 U. S. at 829. It may “not exclude speech\nwhere its distinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose\nserved by the forum, … nor may it discriminate against speech on\nthe basis of … viewpoint.” Ibid . Pp. 17–19. (c) Hastings’\nall-comers policy is reasonable, taking into account the RSO\nforum’s function and “all the surrounding circumstances.” Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund,\nInc. , 473 U. S.\n788 , 809. Pp. 19–28. (1) The\nCourt’s inquiry is shaped by the educational context in which it\narises: “First Amendment rights must be analyzed in light of the\nspecial characteristics of the school environment.” Widmar , 454 U. S., at 268, n. 5. This Court is the\nfinal arbiter of whether a public university has exceeded\nconstitutional constraints. The Court has, however, cautioned\ncourts to resist “substitut[ing] their own notions of sound\neducational policy for those of … school authorities,” for judges\nlack the on-the-ground expertise and experience of school\nadministrators. Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School\nDist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley , 458 U. S. 176 , 206.\nBecause schools enjoy “a significant measure of authority over the\ntype of officially recognized activities in which their students\nparticipate,” Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist.\n66) v. Mergens , 496 U. S. 226 , 240, the\nCourt approaches its task here mindful that Hastings’ decisions\nabout the character of its student-group program are due decent\nrespect. Pp. 19–21. (2) The\njustifications Hastings asserts in support of its all-comers policy\nare reasonable in light of the RSO forum’s purposes. First, the\npolicy ensures that the leadership, educational, and social\nopportunities afforded by RSOs are available to all students. RSOs\nare eligible for financial assistance drawn from mandatory\nstudent-activity fees; the policy ensures that no Hastings student\nis forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member.\nSecond, the policy helps Hastings police the written terms of its\nNondiscrimination Policy without inquiring into an RSO’s motivation\nfor membership restrictions. CLS’s proposal that Hastings permit\nexclusion because of belief but forbid discrimination due\nto status would impose on Hastings the daunting task of\ntrying to determine whether a student organization cloaked\nprohibited status exclusion in belief-based garb. Third, Hastings\nreasonably adheres to the view that its policy, to the extent it\nbrings together individuals with diverse backgrounds and beliefs,\nencourages tolerance, cooperation, and learning among students.\nFourth, the policy incorporates state-law discrimination\nproscriptions, thereby conveying Hastings’ decision to decline to\nsubsidize conduct disapproved by the State. So long as a public\nschool does not contravene constitutional limits, its choice to\nadvance state-law goals stands on firm footing. Pp. 21–24. (3) Hastings’\npolicy is all the more creditworthy in light of the “substantial\nalternative channels that remain open for [CLS-student]\ncommunication to take place.” Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry\nLocal Educators’ Assn. , 460 U. S. 37 , 53.\nHastings offered CLS access to school facilities to conduct\nmeetings and the use of chalkboards and certain bulletin boards to\nadvertise events. Although CLS could not take advantage of\nRSO-specific methods of communication, the advent of electronic\nmedia and social-networking sites lessens the importance of those\nchannels. Private groups, such as fraternities and sororities,\ncommonly maintain a presence at universities without official\nschool affiliation. CLS was similarly situated: It hosted a variety\nof activities the year after Hastings denied it recognition, and\nthe number of students attending those meetings and events doubled.\n“The variety and type of alternative modes of access present here,”\nin short, “compare favorably with those in other [limited public]\nforum cases where [the Court has] upheld restrictions.” Id., at 53–54. Pp. 24–25. (4) CLS’s\narguments that the all-comers policy is not reasonable are\nunavailing. CLS contends that there can be no diversity of\nviewpoints in a forum when groups are not permitted to form around\nviewpoints, but this argument confuses CLS’s preferred policy with\nconstitutional limitation—the advisability of Hastings’\npolicy does not control its permissibility . A State’s\nrestriction on access to a limited public forum, moreover, “need\nnot be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.” Cornelius , 473 U. S., at 808. CLS’s contention that\nHastings’ policy will facilitate hostile takeovers of RSOs by\nstudent saboteurs bent on subverting a group’s mission is more\nhypothetical than real; there is no history or prospect of\nRSO-hijackings at Hastings. Cf. National Endowment for\nArts v. Finley , 524 U. S. 569 , 584.\nFinally, CLS’s assertion that Hastings lacks any legitimate\ninterest in urging religious groups not to favor co-religionists\nerroneously focuses on the benefits the group must forgo, while\nignoring the interests of those it seeks to fence out. Hastings,\ncaught in the crossfire between a group’s desire to exclude and\nstudents’ demand for equal access, may reasonably draw a line in\nthe sand permitting all organizations to express what they\nwish but no group to discriminate in membership. Pp.\n25–28. (d) Hastings’\nall-comers policy is viewpoint neutral. Pp. 28–31. (1) The\npolicy draws no distinction between groups based on their message\nor perspective; its requirement that all student groups\naccept all comers is textbook viewpoint neutral.\nPp. 28–29. (2) Conceding\nthat the policy is nominally neutral, CLS asserts that it\nsystematically—and impermissibly—burdens most heavily those groups\nwhose viewpoints are out of favor with the campus mainstream. This\nargument fails because “[a] regulation that serves purposes\nunrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if\nit has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not\nothers.” Ward v. Rock Against Racism , 491 U. S. 781 , 791.\nHastings’ requirement that RSOs accept all comers, the Court is\nsatisfied, is “justified without reference to the content [or\nviewpoint] of the regulated speech.” Id., at 791. It\ntargets the act of rejecting would-be group members\nwithout reference to the reasons motivating that behavior. Pp.\n29–31. 3. Neither lower court addressed CLS’s\nargument that Hastings selectively enforces its all-comers policy.\nThis Court is not the proper forum to air the issue in the first\ninstance. On remand, the Ninth Circuit may consider this argument\nif, and to the extent, it is preserved. Pp. 31–32. 319 Fed. Appx. 645, affirmed and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the\nopinion of the Court, in which Stevens, Kennedy, Breyer, and\nSotomayor, JJ., joined. Stevens, J., and Kennedy, J., filed\nconcurring opinions. Alito, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in\nwhich Roberts, C. J., and Scalia and Thomas, JJ., joined. OPINION OF THE COURT CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOC. CHAPTER OF UNIV. OF CAL.,HASTINGS COLLEGE OF\nLAW V. MARTINEZ 561 U. S. ____ (2010) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 08-1371 CHRISTIAN LEGAL SOCIETY CHAPTER OF THE UNI- VERSITY\nOF CALIFORNIA, HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW, aka HASTINGS CHRISTIAN\nFELLOW- SHIP, PETITIONER v. LEO P. MARTINEZ\net al. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit [June 28, 2010] Justice Ginsburg delivered the\nopinion of the Court. In a series of decisions, this\nCourt has emphasized that the First Amendment generally precludes\npublic universities from denying student organizations access to\nschool-sponsored forums because of the groups’ viewpoints. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of\nVa. , 515 U. S. 819 (1995); Widmar v. Vincent , 454 U. S. 263 (1981); Healy v. James , 408 U. S. 169 (1972).\nThis case concerns a novel question regarding student activities at\npublic universities: May a public law school condition its official\nrecognition of a student group—and the attendant use of school\nfunds and facilities—on the organization’s agreement to open\neligibility for membership and leadership to all students? In the view of petitioner Christian Legal\nSociety (CLS), an accept-all-comers policy impairs its First\nAmendment rights to free speech, expressive association, and free\nexercise of religion by prompting it, on pain of relinquishing the\nadvantages of recognition, to accept members who do not share the\norganization’s core beliefs about religion and sexual orientation.\nFrom the perspective of respondent Hastings College of the Law\n(Hastings or the Law School), CLS seeks special dispensation from\nan across-the-board open-access requirement designed to further the\nreasonable educational purposes underpinning the school’s\nstudent-organization program. In accord with the District Court and the\nCourt of Appeals, we reject CLS’s First Amendment challenge.\nCompliance with Hastings’ all-comers policy, we conclude, is a\nreasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the\nstudent-organization forum. In requiring CLS—in common with all\nother student organizations—to choose between welcoming all\nstudents and forgoing the benefits of official recognition, we\nhold, Hastings did not transgress constitutional limitations. CLS,\nit bears emphasis, seeks not parity with other organizations, but a\npreferential exemption from Hastings’ policy. The First Amendment\nshields CLS against state prohibition of the organization’s\nexpressive activity, however exclusionary that activity may be. But\nCLS enjoys no constitutional right to state subvention of its\nselectivity. I Founded in 1878, Hastings was the\nfirst law school in the University of California public-school\nsystem. Like many institutions of higher education, Hastings\nencourages students to form extracurricular associations that\n“contribute to the Hastings community and experience.” App. 349.\nThese groups offer students “opportunities to pursue academic and\nsocial interests outside of the classroom [to] further their\neducation” and to help them “develo[p] leadership skills.” Ibid. Through its “Registered\nStudent Organization” (RSO) program, Hastings extends official\nrecognition to student groups. Several benefits attend this\nschool-approved status. RSOs are eligible to seek financial\nassistance from the Law School, which subsidizes their events using\nfunds from a mandatory student-activity fee imposed on all\nstudents. Id., at 217. RSOs may also use Law-School channels\nto communicate with students: They may place announcements in a\nweekly Office-of-Student-Services newsletter, advertise events on\ndesignated bulletin boards, send e-mails using a\nHastings-organization address, and participate in an annual Student\nOrganizations Fair designed to advance recruitment efforts. Id., at 216–219. In addition, RSOs may apply for\npermission to use the Law School’s facilities for meetings and\noffice space. Id., at 218–219. Finally, Hastings allows\nofficially recognized groups to use its name and logo. Id., at 216. In exchange for these benefits, RSOs must\nabide by certain conditions. Only a “non-commercial organization\nwhose membership is limited to Hastings students may become [an\nRSO].” App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a. A prospective RSO must submit\nits bylaws to Hastings for approval, id., at 83a–84a; and\nif it intends to use the Law School’s name or logo, it must sign a\nlicense agreement, App. 219. Critical here, all RSOs must undertake\nto comply with Hastings’ “Policies and Regulations Applying to\nCollege Activities, Organizations and Students.” Ibid.[ Footnote 1 ] The Law School’s Policy on Nondiscrimination\n(Nondiscrimination Policy), which binds RSOs, states: “[Hastings] is committed to a policy against\nlegally impermissible, arbitrary or unreasonable discriminatory\npractices. All groups, including administration, faculty, student\ngovernments, [Hastings]-owned student residence facilities and\nprograms sponsored by [Hastings], are governed by this policy of\nnondiscrimination. [Hasting’s] policy on nondiscrimination is to\ncomply fully with applicable law. “[Hastings] shall not discriminate unlawfully on the basis of\nrace, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age,\nsex or sexual orientation. This nondiscrimination policy covers\nadmission, access and treatment in Hastings-sponsored programs and\nactivities.” Id., at 220. Hastings interprets the\nNondiscrimination Policy, as it relates to the RSO program, to\nmandate acceptance of all comers: School-approved groups must\n“allow any student to participate, become a member, or seek\nleadership positions in the organization, regardless of [her]\nstatus or beliefs.” Id., at 221.[ Footnote 2 ] Other law schools have adopted similar\nall-comers policies. See, e.g., Georgetown University Law\nCenter, Office of Student Life: Student Organi zations, available\nat http://www.law.georgetown.edu/\nStudentLife/StudentOrgs/NewGroup.htm (All Internet materials as\nvisited June 24, 2010, and included in Clerk of Court’s case file)\n(Membership in registered groups must be “open to all students.”);\nHofstra Law School Student Handbook 2009–2010, p. 49, available at\nhttp:// law.hofstra.edu/pdf/StudentLife/StudentAffairs/Handbook/\nstuhb_handbook.pdf (“[Student] organizations are open to all\nstudents.”). From Hastings’ adoption of its Nondiscrimination\nPolicy in 1990 until the events stirring this litigation, “no\nstudent organization at Hastings … ever sought an exemption from\nthe Policy.” App. 221. In 2004, CLS became the first student group to\ndo so. At the beginning of the academic year, the leaders of a\npredecessor Christian organization—which had been an RSO at\nHastings for a decade—formed CLS by affiliating with the national\nChristian Legal Society (CLS-National). Id., at 222–223,\n225. CLS-National, an association of Christian lawyers and law\nstudents, charters student chapters at law schools throughout the\ncountry. Id., at 225. CLS chapters must adopt bylaws that, inter alia , require members and officers to sign a\n“Statement of Faith” and to conduct their lives in accord with\nprescribed principles. Id., at 225–226; App. to Pet. for\nCert. 101a.[ Footnote 3 ] Among\nthose tenets is the belief that sexual activity should not occur\noutside of marriage between a man and a woman; CLS thus interprets\nits bylaws to exclude from affiliation anyone who engages in\n“unrepentant homosexual conduct.” App. 226. CLS also excludes\nstudents who hold religious convictions different from those in the\nStatement of Faith. Id., at 227. On September 17, 2004, CLS submitted to\nHastings an application for RSO status, accompanied by all required\ndocuments, including the set of bylaws mandated by CLS-National. Id., at 227–228. Several days later, the Law School\nrejected the application; CLS’s bylaws, Hastings explained, did not\ncomply with the Nondiscrimination Policy because CLS barred\nstudents based on religion and sexual orientation. Id., at\n228. CLS formally requested an exemption from the\nNondiscrimination Policy, id., at 281, but Hastings\ndeclined to grant one. “[T]o be one of our student-recognized\norganizations,” Hastings reiterated, “CLS must open its membership\nto all students irrespective of their religious beliefs or sexual\norientation.” Id., at 294. If CLS instead chose to operate\noutside the RSO program, Hastings stated, the school “would be\npleased to provide [CLS] the use of Hastings facilities for its\nmeetings and activities.” Ibid. CLS would also have access\nto chalkboards and generally available campus bulletin boards to\nannounce its events. Id., at 219, 233. In other words,\nHastings would do nothing to suppress CLS’s endeavors, but neither\nwould it lend RSO-level support for them. Refusing to alter its bylaws, CLS did not\nobtain RSO status. It did, however, operate independently during\nthe 2004–2005 academic year. CLS held weekly Bible-study meetings\nand invited Hastings students to Good Friday and Easter Sunday\nchurch services. Id., at 229. It also hosted a beach\nbarbeque, Thanksgiving dinner, campus lecture on the Christian\nfaith and the legal practice, several fellowship dinners, an\nend-of-year banquet, and other informal social activities. Ibid. On October 22, 2004, CLS filed suit against\nvarious Hastings officers and administrators under 42 U. S. C.\n§1983. Its complaint alleged that Hastings’ refusal to grant the\norganization RSO status violated CLS’s First and Fourteenth\nAmendment rights to free speech, expressive association, and free\nexercise of religion. The suit sought injunctive and declaratory\nrelief.[ Footnote 4 ] On cross-motions for summary judgment, the U.\nS. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled in\nfavor of Hastings. The Law School’s all-comers condition on access\nto a limited public forum, the court held, was both reasonable and\nviewpoint neutral, and therefore did not violate CLS’s right to\nfree speech. App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a–38a. Nor, in the District Court’s view, did the Law\nSchool impermissibly impair CLS’s right to expressive association.\n“Hastings is not directly ordering CLS to admit [any] studen[t],”\nthe court observed, id., at 42a; “[r]ather, Hastings has\nmerely placed conditions on” the use of its facilities and funds, ibid. “Hastings’ denial of official recognition,” the\ncourt added, “was not a substantial impediment to CLS’s ability to\nmeet and communicate as a group.” Id., at 49a. The court also rejected CLS’s Free Exercise\nClause argument. “[T]he Nondiscrimination Policy does not target or\nsingle out religious beliefs,” the court noted; rather, the policy\n“is neutral and of general applicability.” Id., at 63a.\n“CLS may be motivated by its religious beliefs to exclude students\nbased on their religion or sexual orientation,” the court\nexplained, “but that does not convert the reason for Hastings’\n[Nondiscrimination Policy] to be one that is religiously-based.” Id., at 63a–64a. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in an\nopinion that stated, in full: “The parties stipulate that\nHastings imposes an open membership rule on all student groups—all\ngroups must accept all comers as voting members even if those\nindividuals disagree with the mission of the group. The conditions\non recognition are therefore viewpoint neutral and reasonable. Truth v. Kent Sch. Dist. , 542 F. 3d 634, 649–50 (9th\nCir. 2008).” Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal. v. Kane , 319 Fed. Appx. 645, 645–646 (CA9 2009). We granted certiorari, 558 U. S.\n____ (2009), and now affirm the Ninth Circuit’s judgment. II Before considering\nthe merits of CLS’s constitutional arguments, we must resolve a\npreliminary issue: CLS urges us to review the Nondiscrimination\nPolicy as written—prohibiting discrimination on several enumerated\nbases, including religion and sexual orientation—and not as a\nrequirement that all RSOs accept all comers. The written terms of\nthe Nondiscrimination Policy, CLS contends, “targe[t] solely those\ngroups whose beliefs are based on religion or that disapprove of a\nparticular kind of sexual behavior,” and leave other associations\nfree to limit membership and leadership to individuals committed to\nthe group’s ideology. Brief for Petitioner 19 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). For example, “[a] political … group can insist that\nits leaders support its purposes and beliefs,” CLS alleges, but “a\nreligious group cannot.” Id., at 20. CLS’s assertion runs\nheadlong into the stipulation of facts it jointly submitted with\nHastings at the summary-judgment stage. In that filing, the parties\nspecified: “Hastings requires that registered\nstudent organizations allow any student to participate,\nbecome a member, or seek leadership positions in the organization,\nregardless of [her] status or beliefs. Thus, for example, the\nHastings Democratic Caucus cannot bar students holding Republican\npolitical beliefs from becoming members or seeking leadership\npositions in the organization.” App. 221 (Joint Stipulation ¶18)\n(emphasis added; citations omitted).[ Footnote 5 ] Under the District Court’s local rules,\nstipulated facts are deemed “undisputed.” Civil Local Rule 56–2 (ND\nCal. 2010). See also Pet. for Cert. 2 (“The material facts of this\ncase are undisputed.”).[ Footnote\n6 ] Litigants, we have long\nrecognized, “[a]re entitled to have [their] case tried upon the\nassumption that … facts, stipulated into the record, were\nestablished.” H. Hackfeld & Co. v. United\nStates , 197 U.\nS. 442 , 447 (1905).[ Footnote\n7 ] This entitlement is the bookend to a party’s undertaking to\nbe bound by the factual stipulations it submits. See post ,\nat 10 (Alito, J., dissenting) (agreeing that “the parties must be\nheld to their Joint Stipulation”). As a leading legal reference\nsummarizes: “[Factual stipulations are] binding and\nconclusive … , and the facts stated are not subject to subsequent\nvariation. So, the parties will not be permitted to deny the truth\nof the facts stated, … or to maintain a contention contrary to the\nagreed statement, … or to suggest, on appeal, that the facts were\nother than as stipulated or that any material fact was omitted. The\nburden is on the party seeking to recover to show his or her right\nfrom the facts actually stated.” 83 C. J. S.,\nStipulations §93 (2000) (footnotes omitted). This Court has\naccordingly refused to consider a party’s argument that\ncontradicted a joint “stipulation [entered] at the outset of th[e]\nlitigation.” Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth , 529 U. S. 217 , 226 (2000). Time and\nagain, the dissent races away from the facts to which CLS\nstipulated. See, e.g., post , at 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11,\n24.[ Footnote 8 ] But factual\nstipulations are “formal concessions … that have the effect of\nwithdrawing a fact from issue and dispensing wholly with the need\nfor proof of the fact. Thus, a judicial admission … is conclusive\nin the case.” 2 K. Broun, McCormick on Evidence §254, p. 181\n(6th ed. 2006) (footnote omitted). See also, e.g. , Oscanyan v. Arms Co. , 103 U. S. 261 , 263\n(1881) (“The power of the court to act in the disposition of a\ntrial upon facts conceded by counsel is as plain as its power to\nact upon the evidence produced.”).[ Footnote 9 ] In light of the joint stipulation,\nboth the District Court and the Ninth Circuit trained their\nattention on the constitutionality of the all-comers requirement,\nas described in the parties’ accord. See 319 Fed. Appx., at\n645–646; App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a; id., at 36a. We\nreject CLS’s unseemly attempt to escape from the stipulation and\nshift its target to Hastings’ policy as written. This opinion,\ntherefore, considers only whether conditioning access to a\nstudent-organization forum on compliance with an all-comers policy\nviolates the Constitution.[ Footnote 10 ] III A In support of the\nargument that Hastings’ all-comers policy treads on its First\nAmendment rights to free speech and expressive association, CLS\ndraws on two lines of decisions. First, in a progression of cases,\nthis Court has employed forum analysis to determine when a\ngovernmental entity, in regulating property in its charge, may\nplace limitations on speech.[ Footnote 11 ] Recognizing a State’s right “to preserve the\nproperty under its control for the use to which it is lawfully\ndedicated,” Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed.\nFund, Inc. , 473\nU. S. 788 , 800 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted), the\nCourt has permitted restrictions on access to a limited public\nforum, like the RSO program here, with this key caveat: Any access\nbarrier must be reasonable and viewpoint neutral, e.g., Rosenberger , 515 U. S., at 829. See also, e.g., Good News Club v. Milford Central School , 533 U. S. 98 ,\n106–107 (2001); Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union\nFree School Dist. , 508 U. S. 384 , 392–393\n(1993); Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators’\nAssn. , 460 U. S.\n37 , 46 (1983).[ Footnote\n12 ] Second, as evidenced\nby another set of decisions, this Court has rigorously reviewed\nlaws and regulations that constrain associational freedom. In the\ncontext of public accommodations, we have subjected restrictions on\nthat freedom to close scrutiny; such restrictions are permitted\nonly if they serve “compelling state interests” that are “unrelated\nto the suppression of ideas”—interests that cannot be advanced\n“through … significantly less restrictive [means].” Roberts v. United States Jaycees , 468 U. S. 609 , 623\n(1984). See also, e.g., Boy Scouts of America v. Dale , 530\nU. S. 640 , 648 (2000). “Freedom of association,” we have\nrecognized, “plainly presupposes a freedom not to associate.” Roberts , 468 U. S., at 623. Insisting that an organization\nembrace unwelcome members, we have therefore concluded, “directly\nand immediately affects associational rights.” Dale , 530\nU. S., at 659. CLS would have us engage each line\nof cases independently, but its expressive-association and\nfree-sp",

    "fulltext": "SYLLABUS OCTOBER TERM, 2009 LEVIN V. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC. SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES LEVIN, TAX COMMISSIONER OF OHIO v .\nCOMMERCE ENERGY, INC., et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the sixth circuit No. 09–223. Argued March 22, 2010—Decided June 1,\n2010 Historically, all Ohio natural gas consumers\npurchased gas from a local distribution company (LDC), the public\nutility serving their geographic area. Today, however, consumers in\nOhio’s major metropolitan areas can alternatively contract with\nindependent marketers (IMs) that compete with LDCs for retail sales\nof natural gas. Respondents, mainly IMs offering to sell natural\ngas to Ohio consumers, sued petitioner Ohio Tax Commissioner\n(Commissioner) in federal court, alleging discriminatory taxation\nof IMs and their patrons in violation of the Commerce and Equal\nProtection Clauses. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief\ninvalidating three tax exemptions Ohio grants exclusively to LDCs.\nThe court initially held that respondents’ suit was not blocked by\nthe Tax Injunction Act (TIA), which prohibits lower federal courts\nfrom restraining “the assessment, levy or collection of any tax\nunder State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be\nhad in the courts of such State,” 28 U. S. C. §1341.\nNevertheless, the court dismissed the suit based on the more\nembracive comity doctrine, which restrains federal courts from\nentertaining claims that risk disrupting state tax administration,\nsee Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary , 454\nU. S. 100 . The Sixth Circuit agreed with the District Court’s\nTIA holding, but reversed the court’s comity ruling, and remanded\nfor adjudication of the merits. A footnote in Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.\nS. 88 , 107, n. 9, the Court of Appeals believed,\nforeclosed an expansive reading of this Court’s comity precedents.\nThe footnote stated that the Court “has relied upon ‘principles of\ncomity’ to preclude original federal-court jurisdiction only when\nplaintiffs have sought district-court aid in order to arrest or\ncountermand state tax collection.” Respondents challenged only a\nfew limited exemptions, the Sixth Circuit observed, therefore their\nsuccess on the merits would not significantly intrude upon Ohio’s\nadministration of its tax system. Held: Under the comity doctrine, a\ntaxpayer’s complaint of allegedly discriminatory state taxation,\neven when framed as a request to increase a competitor’s tax\nburden, must proceed originally in state court. Pp. 5–17. (a) The comity doctrine\nreflects a proper respect for the States and their institutions. E.g., Fair Assessment , 454 U. S., at 112.\nComity’s constraint has particular force when lower federal courts\nare asked to pass on the constitutionality of state taxation of\ncommercial activity. States rely chiefly on taxation to fund their\ngovernments’ operations, therefore their tax-enforcement methods\nshould not be interfered with absent strong cause. See Dows v. Chicago , 11 Wall. 108, 110. The TIA was\nenacted specifically to constrain the issuance of federal\ninjunctions in state-tax cases, see Fair Assessment , 454\nU. S., at 129, and is best understood as but a partial codification\nof the federal reluctance to interfere with state taxation, National Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax\nComm’n , 515 U.\nS. 582 , 590. Pp. 5–8. (b) Hibbs does not restrict\ncomity’s compass. Plaintiffs in Hibbs were Arizona\ntaxpayers who challenged, as violative of the Establishment Clause,\na tax credit that allegedly served to support parochial schools.\nTheir federal-court suit for declaratory and injunctive relief did\nnot implicate in any way their own tax liability, and the relief\nthey sought would not deplete the State’s treasury. Rejecting\nArizona’s plea that the TIA barred the suit, the Court found that\nthe case was “not rationally distinguishable” from pathmarking\ncivil-rights controversies in which federal courts had entertained\nchallenges to state tax credits without conceiving of the TIA as a\njurisdictional barrier. 542 U. S.em>., at 93–94, 110–112. The\nCourt also dispatched Arizona’s comity argument in the footnote\nthat moved the Sixth Circuit here to reverse the District Court’s\ncomity-based dismissal. Id., at 107, n. 9. Neither Hibbs nor any other decision of this Court, however, has\nconsidered the comity doctrine’s application to cases of the kind\npresented here. Pp. 8–10. (c) Respondents contend that state action\n“selects [them] out for discriminatory treatment by subjecting\n[them] to taxes not imposed on others of the same class.” Hillsborough v. Cromwell , 326 U. S. 620 , 623. When\neconomic legislation does not employ classifications subject to\nheightened scrutiny or impinge on fundamental rights, courts\ngenerally view constitutional challenges with the skepticism due\nrespect for legislative choices demands. See, e.g., Hodel v. Indiana , 452 U. S. 314 , 331–332.\nAnd “in taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures\npossess the greatest freedom in classification.” Madden v. Kentucky , 309 U. S. 83 , 88. Of key\nimportance, when unlawful discrimination infects tax\nclassifications or other legislative prescriptions, the\nConstitution simply calls for equal treatment . How\nequality is accomplished—by extension or invalidation of the\nunequally distributed benefit or burden, or some other measure—is a\nmatter on which the Constitution is silent. See, e.g.,\nHeckler v. Mathews , 465 U. S. 728 , 740. On\nfinding unlawful discrimination, courts may attempt, within the\nbounds of their institutional competence, to implement what the\nlegislature would have willed had it been apprised of the\nconstitutional infirmity. E.g., id., at 739, n. 5.\nWith the State’s legislative prerogative firmly in mind, this\nCourt, upon finding impermissible discrimination in a State’s tax\nmeasure, generally remands the case, leaving the interim remedial\nchoice to state courts. See, e.g., McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of\nBusiness Regulation , 496 U. S. 18 , 39–40. If\nlower federal courts were to consider the merits of suits alleging\nuneven state tax burdens, however, recourse to state court for the\ninterim remedial determination would be unavailable, for federal\ntribunals lack authority to remand to state court an action\ninitiated in federal court. Federal judges, moreover, are bound by\nthe TIA, which generally precludes relief that would diminish state\nrevenues, even if such relief is the remedy least disruptive of the\nstate legislature’s design. These limitations on the remedial\ncompetence of lower federal courts counsel that they refrain from\ntaking up cases of this genre, so long as state courts are equipped\nfairly to adjudicate them. Pp. 10–13. (d) Comity considerations warrant\ndismissal of respondents’ suit. If Ohio’s scheme is\nunconstitutional, the Ohio courts are better positioned to\ndetermine—unless and until the Ohio Legislature weighs in—how to\ncomply with the mandate of equal treatment. See Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury , 489 U. S. 803 , 817–818.\nThe unelaborated comity footnote in Hibbs does not counsel\notherwise. Hardly a run-of-the-mine tax case, Hibbs was\nessentially an attack on the allocation of state resources for\nallegedly unconstitutional purposes. Plaintiffs there were third\nparties whose own tax liability was not a relevant factor. Here, by\ncontrast, the very premise of respondents’ suit is that they are\ntaxed differently from LDCs. The Hibbs footnote is most\nsensibly read to affirm that, just as that case was a poor fit\nunder the TIA, so it was a poor fit for comity. Respondents’\nargument that this case is fit for federal-court adjudication\nbecause of the simplicity of the relief sought is unavailing. Even\nif their claims had merit, respondents would not be entitled to\ntheir preferred remedy. In Hibbs , however, if the District\nCourt found the Arizona tax credit impermissible under the\nEstablishment Clause, only one remedy would redress the plaintiffs’\ngrievance: invalidation of the tax credit at issue.\nPp. 13–15. (e) In sum, a confluence of factors in\nthis case, absent in Hibbs , leads to the conclusion that\nthe comity doctrine controls here. First, respondents seek\nfederal-court review of commercial matters over which Ohio enjoys\nwide regulatory latitude; their suit does not involve any\nfundamental right or classification that attracts heightened\njudicial scrutiny. Second, while respondents portray themselves as\nthird-party challengers to an allegedly unconstitutional tax\nscheme, they are in fact seeking federal-court aid in an endeavor\nto improve their competitive position. Third, the Ohio courts are\nbetter positioned than their federal counterparts to correct any\nviolation because they are more familiar with state legislative\npreferences and because the TIA does not constrain their remedial\noptions. Individually, these considerations may not compel\nforbearance by federal district courts; in combination, however,\nthey demand deference to the state adjudicative process. Pp.\n15–16. (f) The Sixth Circuit’s concern that\napplication of the comity doctrine here would render the TIA\neffectively superfluous overlooks Congress’ aim, in enacting the\nTIA, to secure the comity doctrine against diminishment. Comity,\nmoreover, is a prudential doctrine. “If the State voluntarily\nchooses to submit to a federal forum, principles of comity do not\ndemand that the federal court force the case back into the State’s\nown system.” Ohio Bureau of Employment Servs. v. Hodory , 431\nU. S. 471 , 480. P. 16. (g) In light of the foregoing, the Court\nneed not decide whether the TIA would itself block this suit.\nPp. 16–17. 554 F. 3d 1094, reversed and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the\nopinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Stevens,\nKennedy, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined. Kennedy, J., filed a\nconcurring opinion. Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in the\njudgment, in which Scalia, J., joined. Alito, J., filed an opinion\nconcurring in the judgment. OPINION OF THE COURT LEVIN V. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC. 560 U. S. ____ (2010) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 09-223 RICHARD A. LEVIN, TAX COMMISSIONER OF OHIO,\nPETITIONER v. COMMERCE ENERGY, INC., et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the sixth circuit [June 1, 2010] Justice Ginsburg delivered the\nopinion of the Court. This case presents the question\nwhether a federal district court may entertain a complaint of\nallegedly discriminatory state taxation, framed as a request to\nincrease a commercial competitor’s tax burden. Relevant to our\ninquiry is the Tax Injunction Act (TIA or Act), 28 U. S. C.\n§1341, which prohibits lower federal courts from restraining “the\nassessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a\nplain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such\nState.” More embracive than the TIA, the comity doctrine applicable\nin state taxation cases restrains federal courts from entertaining\nclaims for relief that risk disrupting state tax administration.\nSee Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary , 454\nU. S. 100 (1981). The comity doctrine, we hold, requires that a\nclaim of the kind here presented proceed originally in state court.\nIn so ruling, we distinguish Hibbs v. Winn , 542 U. S. 88 (2004), in which the Court held that neither the TIA nor the comity\ndoctrine barred a federal district court from adjudicating an\nEstablishment Clause challenge to a state tax credit that allegedly\nfunneled public funds to parochial schools. I A Historically, all natural gas\nconsumers in Ohio purchased gas from the public utility, known as a\nlocal distribution company (LDC), serving their geographic area. In\naddition to selling gas as a commodity, LDCs own and operate\nnetworks of distribution pipelines to transport and deliver gas to\nconsumers. LDCs offer customers a single, bundled product\ncomprising both gas and delivery. Today, consumers in Ohio’s major\nmetropolitan areas can alternatively contract with an independent\nmarketer (IM) that competes with LDCs for retail sales of natural\ngas. IMs do not own or operate distribution pipelines; they use\nLDCs’ pipelines. When a customer goes with an IM, therefore, she\npurchases two “unbundled” products: gas (from the IM) and delivery\n(from the LDC). Ohio treats LDCs and IMs differently for tax\npurposes. Relevant here, Ohio affords LDCs three tax exemptions\nthat IMs do not receive. First, LDCs’ natural gas sales are exempt\nfrom sales and use taxes. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §5739.02(B)(7) (Lexis\nSupp. 2010); §§5739.021(E), .023(G), .026(F) (Lexis 2008);\n§§5741.02(C), .021(A), .022(A), .023(A) (Lexis 2008). LDCs owe\ninstead a gross receipts excise tax, §5727.24, which is lower than\nthe sales and use taxes IMs must collect. Second, LDCs are not\nsubject to the commercial activities tax imposed on IMs’ taxable\ngross receipts. §§5751.01(E)(2), .02 (Lexis Supp. 2010). Finally,\nOhio law excludes inter-LDC natural gas sales from the gross\nreceipts tax, which IMs must pay when they purchase gas from LDCs.\n§5727.33(B)(4) (Lexis 2008). B Plaintiffs-respondents Commerce\nEnergy, Inc., a California corporation, and Interstate Gas Supply,\nInc., an Ohio company, are IMs that market and sell natural gas to\nOhio consumers. Plaintiff-respondent Gregory Slone is an Ohio\ncitizen who has purchased natural gas from Interstate Gas Supply\nsince 1999. Alleging discriminatory taxation of IMs and their\npatrons in violation of the Commerce and Equal Protection Clauses,\nComplaint ¶¶35–39, App. 11–13, respondents sued Richard A. Levin,\nTax Commissioner of Ohio (Commissioner), in the U. S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of Ohio. Invoking that court’s\nfederal-question jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. §1331,\nComplaint ¶6, App. 3, respondents sought declaratory and injunctive\nrelief invalidating the three tax exemptions LDCs enjoy and\nordering the Commissioner to stop “recognizing and/or enforcing”\nthe exemptions. Id. , at 20–21. Respondents named the\nCommissioner as sole defendant; they did not extend the litigation\nto include the LDCs whose tax burden their suit aimed to\nincrease.[ Footnote 1 ] The District Court granted the\nCommissioner’s motion to dismiss the complaint. The TIA did not\nblock the suit, the District Court initially held, because\nrespondents, like the plaintiffs in Hibbs , were\n“third-parties challenging the constitutionality of [another’s] tax\nbenefit,” and their requested relief “would not disrupt the flow of\ntax revenue” to the State. App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a. Nevertheless, the District Court “decline[d]\nto exercise jurisdiction” as a matter of comity. Id., at\n32a. Ohio’s Legislature, the District Court observed, chose to\nprovide the challenged tax exemptions to LDCs. Respondents\nrequested relief that would “requir[e] Ohio to collect taxes which\nits legislature has not seen fit to impose.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Such relief, the court said,\nwould draw federal judges into “a particularly inappropriate\ninvolvement in a state’s management of its fiscal operations.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). A state court,\nthe District Court recognized, could extend the exemptions to IMs,\nbut the TIA proscribed this revenue-reducing relief in federal\ncourt. “Where there would be two possible remedies,” the Court\nconcluded, a federal court should not “impose its own judgment on\nthe state legislature mandating which remedy is appropriate.” Ibid. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth\nCircuit reversed. 554 F. 3d 1094 (2009). While agreeing that\nthe TIA did not bar respondents’ suit, the Sixth Circuit rejected\nthe District Court’s comity ruling. A footnote in Hibbs ,\nthe Court of Appeals believed, foreclosed the District Court’s\n“expansive reading” of this Court’s comity precedents. 554\nF. 3d, at 1098. The footnote stated that the Court “has relied\nupon ‘principles of comity’ to preclude original federal-court\njurisdiction only when plaintiffs have sought district-court aid in\norder to arrest or countermand state tax collection.” Hibbs , 542 U. S., at 107, n. 9 (citation omitted). A\nbroad view of the comity cases, the Sixth Circuit feared, would\nrender the TIA “effectively superfluous,” and would “ sub\nsilentio overrule a series of important cases” presenting\nchallenges to state tax measures. 554 F. 3d, at 1099, 1102\n(citing Milliken v. Bradley , 433 U. S. 267 (1977); Mueller v. Allen , 463 U. S. 388 (1983));\n554 F. 3d, at 1099–1100. In so ruling, the Sixth Circuit agreed with\nthe Seventh and Ninth Circuits, which had similarly read Hibbs to rein in the comity doctrine, see Levy v. Pappas , 510 F. 3d 755 (CA7 2007); Wilbur v. Locke , 423 F. 3d 1101 (CA9 2005), and it disagreed\nwith the Fourth Circuit, which had concluded that Hibbs left comity doctrine untouched, see DIRECTV, Inc. v. Tolson , 513 F. 3d 119 (2008). Noting that respondents\n“challenge[d] only a few limited exemptions,” and satisfied,\ntherefore, that “[respondents’] success would not significantly\nintrude upon traditional matters of state taxation,” the Sixth\nCircuit remanded the case for adjudication of the merits. 554\nF. 3d, at 1102. After unsuccessfully moving for rehearing en\nbanc, App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a–2a, the Commissioner petitioned for\ncertiorari. By then, the First Circuit had joined the Sixth,\nSeventh, and Ninth Circuits in holding that Hibbs sharply\nlimited the scope of the comity bar. Coors Brewing Co. v. Méndez-Torres , 562 F. 3d 3 (2009). We granted the\nCommissioner’s petition, 558 U. S. ___ (2009), to resolve the\ndisagreement among the Circuits. II A Comity considerations, the\nCommissioner dominantly urges, preclude the exercise of lower\nfederal-court adjudicatory authority over this controversy, given\nthat an adequate state-court forum is available to hear and decide\nrespondents’ constitutional claims. We agree. The comity doctrine counsels\nlower federal courts to resist engagement in certain cases falling\nwithin their jurisdiction. The doctrine reflects “a proper respect for state functions, a\nrecognition of the fact that the entire country is made up of a\nUnion of separate state governments, and a continuance of the\nbelief that the National Government will fare best if the States\nand their institutions are left free to perform their separate\nfunctions in separate ways.” Fair Assessment , 454 U. S.,\nat 112 (quoting Younger v. Harris , 401 U. S. 37 , 44\n(1971)). Comity’s constraint has particular force when lower\nfederal courts are asked to pass on the constitutionality of state\ntaxation of commercial activity. For “[i]t is upon taxation that\nthe several States chiefly rely to obtain the means to carry on\ntheir respective governments, and it is of the utmost importance to\nall of them that the modes adopted to enforce the taxes levied\nshould be interfered with as little as possible.” Dows v. Chicago , 11 Wall. 108, 110 (1871). “An examination of [our] decisions,” this\nCourt wrote more than a century ago, “shows that a proper\nreluctance to interfere by prevention with the fiscal operations of\nthe state governments has caused [us] to refrain from so doing in\nall cases where the Federal rights of the persons could otherwise\nbe preserved unimpaired.” Boise Artesian Hot & Cold Water\nCo. v. Boise City , 213 U. S. 276 , 282\n(1909). Accord Matthews v. Rodgers , 284 U. S. 521 , 525–526\n(1932) (So long as the state remedy was “plain, adequate, and\ncomplete,” the “scrupulous regard for the rightful independence of\nstate governments which should at all times actuate the federal\ncourts, and a proper reluctance to interfere by injunction with\ntheir fiscal operations, require that such relief should be denied\nin every case where the asserted federal right may be preserved\nwithout it.”).[ Footnote 2 ] Statutes conferring federal jurisdiction, we\nhave repeatedly cautioned, should be read with sensitivity to\n“federal-state relations” and “wise judicial administration.” Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co. , 517 U. S. 706 , 716\n(1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). But by 1937, in state\ntax cases, the federal courts had moved in a different direction:\nthey “had become free and easy with injunctions.” Fair\nAssessment , 454 U. S., at 129 (Brennan, J., concurring in\njudgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).[ Footnote 3 ] Congress passed the TIA to reverse\nthis trend. Id., at 109–110 (opinion of the Court). Our post-Act decisions, however, confirm the\ncontinuing sway of comity considerations, independent of the Act.\nPlaintiffs in Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman , 319 U. S. 293 (1943),\nfor example, sought a federal judgment declaring Louisiana’s\nunemployment compensation tax unconstitutional. Writing six years\nafter the TIA’s passage, we emphasized the Act’s animating\nconcerns: A “federal court of equity,” we reminded, “may in an\nappropriate case refuse to give its special protection to private\nrights when the exercise of its jurisdiction would be prejudicial\nto the public interest, [and] should stay its hand in the public\ninterest when it reasonably appears that private interests will not\nsuffer.” Id., at 297–298 (citations omitted). In enacting\nthe TIA, we noted, “Congress recognized and gave sanction to this\npractice.” Id., at 298. We could not have thought Congress\nintended to cabin the comity doctrine, for we went on to instruct\ndismissal in Great Lakes on comity grounds without\ndeciding whether the Act reached declaratory judgment actions. Id., at 299, 301–302.[ Footnote 4 ] Decades later, in Fair Assessment , we\nruled, based on comity concerns, that 42 U. S. C. §1983 does\nnot permit federal courts to award damages in state taxation cases\nwhen state law provides an adequate remedy. 454 U. S., at 116. We\nclarified in Fair Assessment that “the principle of comity\nwhich predated the Act was not restricted by its passage.” Id., at 110. And in National Private Truck Council,\nInc. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm’n , 515 U. S. 582 , 590\n(1995), we said, explicitly, that “the [TIA] may be best understood\nas but a partial codification of the federal reluctance to\ninterfere with state taxation.” B Although our precedents affirm\nthat the comity doctrine is more embracive than the TIA, several\nCourts of Appeals, including the Sixth Circuit in the instant case,\nhave comprehended Hibbs to restrict comity’s compass. See supra , at 4–5. Hibbs , however, has a more modest\nreach. Plaintiffs in Hibbs were\nArizona taxpayers who challenged a state law authorizing tax\ncredits for payments to organizations that disbursed scholarship\ngrants to children attending private schools. 542 U. S., at 94–96.\nThese organizations could fund attendance at institutions that\nprovided religious instruction or gave admissions preference on the\nbasis of religious affiliation. Id., at 95. Ranking the\ncredit program as state subsidization of religion, incompatible\nwith the Establishment Clause, plaintiffs sought declaratory and\ninjunctive relief and an order requiring the organizations to pay\nsums still in their possession into the State’s general fund. Id., at 96. The Director of Arizona’s Department of\nRevenue sought to escape suit in federal court by invoking the TIA.\nWe held that the litigation fell outside the TIA’s governance. Our\nprior decisions holding suits blocked by the TIA, we noted, were\ntied to the Act’s “state-revenue-protective moorings.” Id., at 106. The Act, we explained, “restrain[ed] state\ntaxpayers from instituting federal actions to contest their [own]\nliability for state taxes,” id., at 108, suits that, if\nsuccessful, would deplete state coffers. But “third parties” like\nthe Hibbs plaintiffs, we concluded, were not impeded by\nthe TIA “from pursuing constitutional challenges to tax benefits in\na federal forum.” Ibid. The case, we stressed, was “not\nrationally distinguishable” from a procession of pathmarking\ncivil-rights controversies in which federal courts had entertained\nchallenges to state tax credits without conceiving of the TIA as a\njurisdictional barrier. Id., at 93–94, 110–112. See, e.g., Griffin v. School Bd. of Prince Edward\nCty. , 377 U. S.\n218 (1964) (involving, inter alia , tax credits for\ncontributions to private segregated schools). Arizona’s Revenue Director also invoked comity\nas cause for dismissing the action. We dispatched the Director’s\ncomity argument in a spare footnote that moved the Sixth Circuit\nhere to reverse the District Court’s comity-based dismissal. As\nearlier set out, see supra , at 4, the footnote stated:\n“[T]his Court has relied upon ‘principles of comity’ to preclude\noriginal federal-court jurisdiction only when plaintiffs have\nsought district-court aid in order to arrest or countermand state\ntax collection.” 542 U. S., at 107, n. 9 (citation omitted)\n(citing Fair Assessment , 454 U. S., at 107–108; Great\nLakes , 319 U. S., at 296–299). Relying heavily on our footnote in Hibbs , respondents urge that “comity should no more bar\nthis action than it did the action in Hibbs .” Brief for\nRespondents 42. As we explain below, however, the two cases differ\nmarkedly in ways bearing on the comity calculus. We have had no\nprior occasion to consider, under the comity doctrine, a taxpayer’s\ncomplaint about allegedly discriminatory state taxation framed as a\nrequest to increase a competitor’s tax burden. Now squarely\npresented with the question, we hold that comity precludes the\nexercise of original federal-court jurisdiction in cases of the\nkind presented here. III A Respondents complain that they\nare taxed unevenly in comparison to LDCs and their customers. Under\neither an equal protection or dormant Commerce Clause theory,\nrespondents’ root objection is the same: State action, respondents\ncontend, “selects [them] out for discriminatory treatment by\nsubjecting [them] to taxes not imposed on others of the same\nclass.” Hillsborough v. Cromwell , 326 U. S. 620 , 623\n(1946) (equal protection); see Dennis v. Higgins , 498 U. S. 439 ,\n447–448 (1991) (dormant Commerce Clause). When economic legislation does\nnot employ classifications subject to heightened scrutiny or\nimpinge on fundamental rights,[ Footnote 5 ] courts generally view constitutional\nchallenges with the skepticism due respect for legislative choices\ndemands. See, e.g., Hodel v. Indiana , 452 U. S. 314 ,\n331–332 (1981); Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla.,\nInc. , 348 U. S.\n483 , 488–489 (1955). And “in taxation, even more than in other\nfields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in\nclassification.” Madden v. Kentucky , 309 U. S. 83 , 88\n(1940). Of key importance, when unlawful\ndiscrimination infects tax classifications or other legislative\nprescriptions, the Constitution simply calls for equal\ntreatment . How equality is accomplished—by extension or\ninvalidation of the unequally distributed benefit or burden, or\nsome other measure—is a matter on which the Constitution is silent.\nSee Heckler v. Mathews , 465 U. S. 728 , 740\n(1984) (“[W]hen the right invoked is that to equal treatment, the\nappropriate remedy is a mandate of equal treatment, a\nresult that can be accomplished” in more than one way. (quoting Iowa-Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Bennett , 284 U. S. 239 , 247\n(1931); internal quotation marks omitted)). On finding unlawful discrimination, we have\naffirmed, courts may attempt, within the bounds of their\ninstitutional competence, to implement what the legislature would\nhave willed had it been apprised of the constitutional infirmity. Mathews , 465 U. S., at 739, n. 5; Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76 , 92–93\n(1979); see Stanton v. Stanton , 421 U. S. 7 , 17–18 (1975)\n(how State eliminates unconstitutional discrimination “plainly is\nan issue of state law”); cf. United States v. Booker , 543\nU. S. 220 , 246 (2005) (“legislative intent” determines cure for\nconstitutional violation). The relief the complaining party\nrequests does not circumscribe this inquiry. See Westcott ,\n443 U. S., at 96, n. 2 (Powell, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part) (“This issue should turn on the intent of [the\nlegislature], not the interests of the parties.”). With the State’s\nlegislative prerogative firmly in mind, this Court, upon finding\nimpermissible discrimination in a State’s allocation of benefits or\nburdens, generally remands the case, leaving the remedial choice in\nthe hands of state authorities. See, e.g., Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co. , 446 U. S. 142 , 152–153\n(1980); Orr v. Orr , 440 U. S. 268 , 283–284\n(1979); Stanton , 421 U. S., at 17–18; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson , 316 U. S. 535 , 543\n(1942). But see, e.g., Levy v. Louisiana , 391 U. S. 68 (1968). In particular, when this Court—on review of a\nstate high court’s decision—finds a tax measure constitutionally\ninfirm, “it has been our practice,” for reasons of “federal-state\ncomity,” “to abstain from deciding the remedial effects of such a\nholding.” American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith , 496\nU. S. 167 , 176 (1990) (plurality opinion).[ Footnote 6 ] A “State found to have imposed an\nimpermissibly discriminatory tax retains flexibility in responding\nto this determination.” McKesson Corp. v. Division of\nAlcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business\nRegulation , 496 U. S. 18 , 39–40 (1990). Our remand\nleaves the interim solution in state-court hands, subject to\nsubsequent definitive disposition by the State’s legislature. If lower federal courts were to give audience\nto the merits of suits alleging uneven state tax burdens, however,\nrecourse to state court for the interim remedial determination\nwould be unavailable. That is so because federal tribunals lack\nauthority to remand to the state court system an action initiated\nin federal court. Federal judges, moreover, are bound by the TIA;\nabsent certain exceptions, see, e.g., Department of\nEmployment v. United States , 385 U. S. 355 , 357–358\n(1966), the Act precludes relief that would diminish state\nrevenues, even if such relief is the remedy least disruptive of the\nstate legislature’s design.[ Footnote 7 ] These limitations on the remedial competence\nof lower federal courts counsel that they refrain from taking up\ncases of this genre, so long as state courts are equipped fairly to\nadjudicate them.[ Footnote\n8 ] B Comity considerations, as the\nDistrict Court determined, warrant dismissal of respondents’ suit.\nAssuming, arguendo , that respondents could prevail on the\nmerits of the suit,[ Footnote 9 ]\nthe most obvious way to achieve parity would be to reduce\nrespondents’ tax liability. Respondents did not seek such relief,\nfor the TIA stands in the way of any decree that would “enjoin …\ncollection of [a] tax under State law.” 28 U. S. C.\n§1341.[ Footnote 10 ] A more\nambitious solution would reshape the relevant provisions of Ohio’s\ntax code. Were a federal court to essay such relief, however, the\ncourt would engage in the very interference in state taxation the\ncomity doctrine aims to avoid. Cf. State Railroad Tax\nCases , 92 U. S.\n575 , 614–615 (1876). Respondents’ requested remedy, an order\ninvalidating the exemptions enjoyed by LDCs, App. 20–21, may be far\nfrom what the Ohio Legislature would have willed. See supra , at 11. In short, if the Ohio scheme is indeed\nunconstitutional, surely the Ohio courts are better positioned to\ndetermine—unless and until the Ohio Legislature weighs in—how to\ncomply with the mandate of equal treatment. See Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury , 489 U. S. 803 , 817–818\n(1989).[ Footnote 11 ] As earlier noted, our\nunelaborated footnote on comity in Hibbs , see supra , at 9, led the Sixth Circuit to conclude that we had\ndiminished the force of that doctrine and made it inapplicable\nhere. We intended no such consequential ruling. Hibbs was\nhardly a run-of-the-mine tax case. It was essentially an attack on\nthe allocation of state resources for allegedly unconstitutional\npurposes. In Hibbs , the charge was state aid in alleged\nviolation of the Establishment Clause; in other cases of the same\ngenre, the attack was on state allocations to maintain racially\nsegregated schools. See Hibbs , 542 U. S., at 93–94,\n110–112. The plaintiffs in Hibbs were outsiders to the tax\nexpenditure, “third parties” whose own tax liability was not a\nrelevant factor. In this case, by contrast, the very premise of\nrespondents’ suit is that they are taxed differently from LDCs.\nUnlike the Hibbs plaintiffs, respondents do object to\ntheir own tax situation, measured by the allegedly more favorable\ntreatment accorded LDCs. Hibbs held that the TIA did not\npreclude a federal challenge by a third party who objected to a tax\ncredit received by others, but in no way objected to her own\nliability under any revenue-raising tax provision. In context, we\nclarify, the Hibbs footnote comment on comity is most\nsensibly read to affirm tha",
    "textpassage": "\"respondents’ suit is that they are taxed differently from LDCs.\""

THOMPKINS certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the sixth circuit No. 08–1470. Argued March 1, 2010—Decided June 1,\n2010 After advising respondent Thompkins of his rights,\nin full compliance with Miranda v. Arizona , 384 U. S. 436 ,\nDetective Helgert and another Michigan officer interrogated him\nabout a shooting in which one victim died. At no point did\nThompkins say that he wanted to remain silent, that he did not want\nto talk with the police, or that he wanted an attorney. He was\nlargely silent during the 3-hour interrogation, but near the end,\nhe answered “yes” when asked if he prayed to God to forgive him for\nthe shooting. He moved to suppress his statements, claiming that he\nhad invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, that he had\nnot waived that right, and that his inculpatory statements were\ninvoluntary. The trial court denied the motion. At trial on\nfirst-degree murder and other charges, the prosecution called Eric\nPurifoy, who drove the van in which Thompkins and a third\naccomplice were riding at the time of the shooting, and who had\nbeen convicted of firearm offenses but acquitted of murder and\nassault. Thompkins’ defense was that Purifoy was the shooter.\nPurifoy testified that he did not see who fired the shots. During\nclosing arguments, the prosecution suggested that Purifoy lied\nabout not seeing the shooter and pondered whether Purifoy’s jury\nhad made the right decision. Defense counsel did not ask the court\nto instruct the jury that it could consider evidence of the outcome\nof Purifoy’s trial only to assess his credibility, not to establish\nThompkins’ guilt. The jury found Thompkins guilty, and he was\nsentenced to life in prison without parole. In denying his motion\nfor a new trial, the trial court rejected as nonprejudicial his\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim for failure to request a\nlimiting instruction about the outcome of Purifoy’s trial. On\nappeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected both Thompkins’ Miranda and his ineffective-assistance claims. The Federal\nDistrict Court denied his subsequent habeas request, reasoning that\nThompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and was not\ncoerced into making statements during the interrogation, and that\nit was not unreasonable, for purposes of the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), see 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(d)(1), for the State Court of Appeals to determine that he\nhad waived his right to remain silent. The Sixth Circuit reversed,\nholding that the state court was unreasonable in finding an implied\nwaiver of Thompkins’ right to remain silent and in rejecting his\nineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. Held : 1. The state court’s\ndecision rejecting Thompkins’ Miranda claim was correct\nunder de novo review and therefore necessarily reasonable\nunder AEDPA’s more deferential standard of review.\nPp. 7–17. (a) Thompkins’ silence\nduring the interrogation did not invoke his right to remain silent.\nA suspect’s Miranda right to counsel must be invoked\n“unambiguously.” Davis v. United States , 512 U. S. 452 , 459. If\nthe accused makes an “ambiguous or equivocal” statement or no\nstatement, the police are not required to end the interrogation, ibid. , or ask questions to clarify the accused’s intent, id., at 461–462. There is no principled reason to adopt\ndifferent standards for determining when an accused has invoked the Miranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to counsel at issue in Davis . Both protect the\nprivilege against compulsory self-incrimination by requiring an\ninterrogation to cease when either right is invoked. The\nunambiguous invocation requirement results in an objective inquiry\nthat “avoid[s] difficulties of proof and … provide[s] guidance to\nofficers” on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. Davis , supra , at 458–459. Had Thompkins said that\nhe wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk, he\nwould have invoked his right to end the questioning. He did\nneither. Pp. 8–10. (b) Thompkins waived\nhis right to remain silent when he knowingly and voluntarily made a\nstatement to police. A waiver must be “the product of a free and\ndeliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception”\nand “made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right\nbeing abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon\nit.” Moran v. Burbine , 475 U. S. 412 , 421. Such\na waiver may be “implied” through a “defendant’s silence, coupled\nwith an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct\nindicating waiver.” North Carolina v. Butler , 441 U. S. 369 ,\n373. If the State establishes that a Miranda warning was\ngiven and that it was understood by the accused, an accused’s\nuncoerced statement establishes an implied waiver. The record here\nshows that Thompkins waived his right to remain silent. First, the\nlack of any contention that he did not understand his rights\nindicates that he knew what he gave up when he spoke. See Burbine , supra , at 421. Second, his answer to the\nquestion about God is a “course of conduct indicating waiver” of\nthat right. Butler , supra , at 373. Had he wanted\nto remain silent, he could have said nothing in response or\nunambiguously invoked his Miranda rights, ending the\ninterrogation. That he made a statement nearly three hours after\nreceiving a Miranda warning does not overcome the fact\nthat he engaged in a course of conduct indicating waiver. Third,\nthere is no evidence that his statement was coerced. See Burbine , supra , at 421. He does not claim that\npolice threatened or injured him or that he was fearful. The\ninterrogation took place in a standard-sized room in the middle of\nthe day, and there is no authority for the proposition that a\n3-hour interrogation is inherently coercive. Cf. Colorado v. Connelly , 479 U. S. 157 , 163–164,\nn. 1. The fact that the question referred to religious beliefs\nalso does not render his statement involuntary. Id. , at\n170. Pp. 10–15. (c) Thompkins argues\nthat, even if his answer to Helgert could constitute a waiver of\nhis right to remain silent, the police were not allowed to question\nhim until they first obtained a waiver. However, a rule requiring a\nwaiver at the outset would be inconsistent with Butler ’s\nholding that courts can infer a waiver “from the actions and words\nof the person interrogated.” 441 U. S., at 373. Any waiver, express\nor implied, may be contradicted by an invocation at any time,\nterminating further interrogation. When the suspect knows that Miranda rights can be invoked at any time, he or she can\nreassess his or her immediate and long-term interests as the\ninterrogation progresses. After giving a Miranda warning,\npolice may interrogate a suspect who has neither invoked nor waived Miranda rights. Thus, the police were not required to\nobtain a waiver of Thompkins’ Miranda rights before\ninterrogating him. Pp. 15–17. 2. Even if his counsel provided\nineffective assistance, Thompkins cannot show prejudice under a de novo review of this record. To establish ineffective\nassistance, a defendant “must show both deficient performance and\nprejudice.” Knowles v. Mirzayance , 556 U. S. ___,\n___. To establish prejudice, a “defendant must show that there is a\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,” Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 , 694,\nconsidering “the totality of the evidence before the judge or\njury,” id. , at 695. Here, the Sixth Circuit did not\naccount for the other evidence presented against Thompkins. The\nstate court rejected his claim that he was prejudiced by evidence\nof Purifoy’s earlier conviction. Even if it used an incorrect legal\nstandard, this Court need not determine whether AEDPA’s deferential\nstandard of review applies here, since Thompkins cannot show\nprejudice under de novo review, a more favorable standard\nfor him. De novo review can be used in this case because a\nhabeas petitioner will not be entitled to relief if his or her\nclaim is rejected on de novo review. See §2254(a).\nAssuming that failure to request a limiting instruction here was\ndeficient representation, Thompkins cannot show prejudice, for the\nrecord shows that it was not reasonably likely that such an\ninstruction would have made any difference in light of other\nevidence of guilt. The surviving victim identified Thompkins as the\nshooter, and the identification was supported by a surveillance\ncamera photograph. A friend testified that Thompkins confessed to\nhim, and the details of that confession were corroborated by\nevidence that Thompkins stripped and abandoned the van after the\nshooting. The jury, moreover, was capable of assessing Purifoy’s\ncredibility, as it was instructed to do. Pp. 17–19. 547 F. 3d 572, reversed and remanded. Kennedy, J., delivered the\nopinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Scalia,\nThomas, and Alito, JJ., joined. Sotomayor, J., filed a dissenting\nopinion, in which Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, JJ., joined. OPINION OF THE COURT BERGHUIS V. THOMPKINS 560 U. S. ____ (2010) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 08-1470 MARY BERGHUIS, WARDEN, PETITIONER v. VAN\nCHESTER THOMPKINS on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the sixth circuit [June 1, 2010] Justice Kennedy delivered the\nopinion of the Court. The United States Court of\nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit, in a habeas corpus proceeding\nchallenging a Michigan conviction for first-degree murder and\ncertain other offenses, ruled that there had been two separate\nconstitutional errors in the trial that led to the jury’s guilty\nverdict. First, the Court of Appeals determined that a statement by\nthe accused, relied on at trial by the prosecution, had been\nelicited in violation of Miranda v. Arizona , 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Second, it found that failure to ask for an instruction\nrelating to testimony from an accomplice was ineffective assistance\nby defense counsel. See Strickland v. Washington , 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Both of these contentions had been rejected in Michigan\ncourts and in the habeas corpus proceedings before the United\nStates District Court. Certiorari was granted to review the\ndecision by the Court of Appeals on both points. The warden of a\nMichigan correctional facility is the petitioner here, and Van\nChester Thompkins, who was convicted, is the respondent. I A On January 10, 2000, a shooting\noccurred outside a mall in Southfield, Michigan. Among the victims\nwas Samuel Morris, who died from multiple gunshot wounds. The other\nvictim, Frederick France, recovered from his injuries and later\ntestified. Thompkins, who was a suspect, fled. About one year later\nhe was found in Ohio and arrested there. Two Southfield police officers\ntraveled to Ohio to interrogate Thompkins, then awaiting transfer\nto Michigan. The interrogation began around 1:30 p.m. and lasted\nabout three hours. The interrogation was conducted in a room that\nwas 8 by 10 feet, and Thompkins sat in a chair that resembled a\nschool desk (it had an arm on it that swings around to provide a\nsurface to write on). App. 144a–145a. At the beginning of the\ninterrogation, one of the officers, Detective Helgert, presented\nThompkins with a form derived from the Miranda rule. It\nstated: “NOTIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND\nSTATEMENT “1. You have the right to remain silent. “2. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court\nof law. “3. You have a right to talk to a lawyer before answering\n   any questions and you have the right to have a\nlawyer present with you while you are answering any\n   questions. “4. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed\nto represent you before any questioning, if you wish one. “5. You have the right to decide at any time before or during\nquestioning to use your right to remain silent and your right to\ntalk with a lawyer while you are being questioned.” Brief for\nPetitioner 60 (some capitalization omitted). Helgert asked Thompkins to read\nthe fifth warning out loud. App. 8a. Thompkins complied. Helgert\nlater said this was to ensure that Thompkins could read, and\nHelgert concluded that Thompkins understood English. Id. ,\nat 9a. Helgert then read the other four Miranda warnings\nout loud and asked Thompkins to sign the form to demonstrate that\nhe understood his rights. App. 8a–9a. Thompkins declined to sign\nthe form. The record contains conflicting evidence about whether\nThompkins then verbally confirmed that he understood the rights\nlisted on the form. Compare id. , at 9a (at a suppression\nhearing, Helgert testified that Thompkins verbally confirmed that\nhe understood his rights), with id. , at 148a (at trial,\nHelgert stated, “I don’t know that I orally asked him” whether\nThompkins understood his rights). Officers began an interrogation. At no point\nduring the interrogation did Thompkins say that he wanted to remain\nsilent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or that he\nwanted an attorney. Id. , at 10a. Thompkins was “[l]argely”\nsilent during the interrogation, which lasted about three hours. Id. , at 19a. He did give a few limited verbal responses,\nhowever, such as “yeah,” “no,” or “I don’t know.” And on occasion\nhe communicated by nodding his head. Id. , at 23a.\nThompkins also said that he “didn’t want a peppermint” that was\noffered to him by the police and that the chair he was “sitting in\nwas hard.” Id. , at 152a. About 2 hours and 45 minutes into the\ninterrogation, Helgert asked Thompkins, “Do you believe in God?” Id. , at 11a, 153a. Thompkins made eye contact with Helgert\nand said “Yes,” as his eyes “well[ed] up with tears.” Id. ,\nat 11a. Helgert asked, “Do you pray to God?” Thompkins said “Yes.” Id. , at 11a, 153a. Helgert asked, “Do you pray to God to\nforgive you for shooting that boy down?” Id. , at 153a.\nThompkins answered “Yes” and looked away. Ibid. Thompkins\nrefused to make a written confession, and the interrogation ended\nabout 15 minutes later. Id. , at 11a. Thompkins was charged with first-degree\nmurder, assault with intent to commit murder, and certain\nfirearms-related offenses. He moved to suppress the statements made\nduring the interrogation. He argued that he had invoked his Fifth\nAmendment right to remain silent, requiring police to end the\ninterrogation at once, see Michigan v. Mosley , 423 U. S. 96 , 103\n(1975) (citing Miranda , 384 U. S., at 474), that he had\nnot waived his right to remain silent, and that his inculpatory\nstatements were involuntary. The trial court denied the motion. At trial, the prosecution’s theory was that\nThompkins shot the victims from the passenger seat of a van driven\nby Eric Purifoy. Purifoy testified that he had been driving the van\nand that Thompkins was in the passenger seat while another man, one\nMyzell Woodward, was in the back. The defense strategy was to pin\nthe blame on Purifoy. Purifoy testified he did not see who fired\nthe weapon because the van was stopped and he was bending over near\nthe floor when shots were fired. Purifoy explained that, just after\nthe shooting, Thompkins, holding a pistol, told Purifoy, “What the\nhell you doing? Pull off.” Purifoy then drove away from the scene.\nApp. 170a. So that the Thompkins jury could assess\nPurifoy’s credibility and knowledge, the prosecution elicited\ntestimony from Purifoy that he had been tried earlier for the\nshooting under an aiding-and-abetting theory. Purifoy and Detective\nHelgert testified that a jury acquitted him of the murder and\nassault charges, convicted him of carrying a concealed weapon in a\nmotor vehicle, and hung on two other firearms offenses to which he\nlater pleaded guilty. At Purifoy’s trial, the prosecution had\nargued that Purifoy was the driver and Thompkins was the shooter.\nThis was consistent with the prosecution’s argument at Thompkins’s\ntrial. After Purifoy’s trial had ended—but before\nThompkins’s trial began—Purifoy sent Thompkins some letters. The\nletters expressed Purifoy’s disappointment that Thompkins’s family\nthought Purifoy was a “snitch” and a “rat.” Id. , at\n179a–180a. In one letter Purifoy offered to send a copy of his\ntrial transcript to Thompkins as proof that Purifoy did not place\nthe blame on Thompkins for the shooting. Id. , at 180a. The\nletters also contained statements by Purifoy that claimed they were\nboth innocent. Id. , at 178a–179a. At Thompkins’s trial,\nthe prosecution suggested that one of Purifoy’s letters appeared to\ngive Thompkins a trial strategy. It was, the prosecution suggested,\nthat Woodward shot the victims, allowing Purifoy and Thompkins to\nsay they dropped to the floor when the shooting started. Id. , at 187a–189a. During closing arguments, the prosecution\nsuggested that Purifoy lied when he testified that he did not see\nThompkins shoot the victims: “Did Eric Purifoy’s Jury make the right decision?\nI’m not here to judge that. You are not bound by what his Jury\nfound. Take his testimony for what it was, [a] twisted attempt to\nhelp not just an acquaintance but his tight buddy.” Id. ,\nat 202a. Defense counsel did not object. Defense counsel\nalso did not ask for an instruction informing the jury that it\ncould consider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy’s trial only to\nassess Purifoy’s credibility, not to establish Thompkins’s\nguilt. The jury found Thompkins guilty on all counts.\nHe was sentenced to life in prison without parole. B The trial court denied a motion\nfor new trial filed by Thompkins’s appellate counsel. The trial\ncourt rejected the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel\nfor failure to ask for a limiting instruction regarding the outcome\nof Purifoy’s trial, reasoning that this did not prejudice\nThompkins. Id. , at 236a. Thompkins appealed this ruling,\nalong with the trial court’s refusal to suppress his pretrial\nstatements under Miranda . The Michigan Court of Appeals\nrejected the Miranda claim, ruling that Thompkins had not\ninvoked his right to remain silent and had waived it. It also\nrejected the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, finding that\nThompkins failed to show that evidence of Purifoy’s conviction for\nfirearms offenses resulted in prejudice. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n74a–82a. The Michigan Supreme Court denied discretionary review.\n471 Mich. 866, 683 N. W. 2d 676 (2004) (table). Thompkins filed a petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Michigan. The District Court rejected Thompkins’s Miranda and ineffective-assistance claims. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 39a–72a. It noted that, under the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a federal court cannot\ngrant a petition for a writ of habeas corpus unless the state\ncourt’s adjudication of the merits was “contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.” 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d)(1). The District Court reasoned that\nThompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and was not\ncoerced into making statements during the interrogation. It held\nfurther that the Michigan Court of Appeals was not unreasonable in\ndetermining that Thompkins had waived his right to remain\nsilent. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit reversed, ruling for Thompkins on both his Miranda and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. 547\nF. 3d 572 (2008). The Court of Appeals ruled that the state\ncourt, in rejecting Thompkins’s Miranda claim,\nunreasonably applied clearly established federal law and based its\ndecision on an unreasonable determination of the facts. See 28 U.\nS. C. §2254(d). The Court of Appeals acknowledged that a\nwaiver of the right to remain silent need not be express, as it can\nbe “ ‘inferred from the actions and words of the person\ninterrogated.’ ” 547 F. 3d, at 582 (quoting North\nCarolina v. Butler , 441 U. S. 369 , 373\n(1979)). The panel held, nevertheless, that the state court was\nunreasonable in finding an implied waiver in the circumstances\nhere. The Court of Appeals found that the state court unreasonably\ndetermined the facts because “the evidence demonstrates that\nThompkins was silent for two hours and forty-five minutes.” 547\nF. 3d, at 586. According to the Court of Appeals, Thompkins’s\n“persistent silence for nearly three hours in response to\nquestioning and repeated invitations to tell his side of the story\noffered a clear and unequivocal message to the officers: Thompkins\ndid not wish to waive his rights.” Id. , at 588. The Court of Appeals next determined that the\nstate court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law by\nrejecting Thompkins’s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim based\non counsel’s failure to ask for a limiting instruction regarding\nPurifoy’s acquittal. The Court of Appeals asserted that because\nThompkins’s central strategy was to pin the blame on Purifoy, there\nwas a reasonable probability that the result of Thompkins’s trial\nwould have been different if there had been a limiting instruction\nregarding Purifoy’s acquittal. We granted certiorari. 557 U. S. ___\n(2009). II Under AEDPA, a federal court may\nnot grant a habeas corpus application “with respect to any claim\nthat was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,” 28\nU. S. C. §2254(d), unless the state court’s decision “was\ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States,” §2254(d)(1), or “was based on an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in\nthe State court proceeding,” §2254(d)(2). See Knowles v. Mirzayance , 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1).\nThe relevant state-court decision here is the Michigan Court of\nAppeals’ decision affirming Thompkins’s conviction and rejecting\nhis Miranda and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims\non the merits. III The Miranda Court\nformulated a warning that must be given to suspects before they can\nbe subjected to custodial interrogation. The substance of the\nwarning still must be given to suspects today. A suspect in custody\nmust be advised as follows: “He must be warned prior to any questioning that he\nhas the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used\nagainst him in a court of law, that he has the right to the\npresence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney\none will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so\ndesires.” 384 U. S., at 479. All concede that the warning given in this case was\nin full compliance with these requirements. The dispute centers on\nthe response—or nonresponse—from the suspect. A Thompkins makes various arguments\nthat his answers to questions from the detectives were\ninadmissible. He first contends that he “invoke[d] his privilege”\nto remain silent by not saying anything for a sufficient period of\ntime, so the interrogation should have “cease[d]” before he made\nhis inculpatory statements. Id. , at 474; see Mosley , 423 U. S., at 103 (police must\n“ ‘scrupulously hono[r]’ ” this “critical safeguard” when\nthe accused invokes his or her “ ‘right to cut off\nquestioning’ ” (quoting Miranda , supra , at\n474, 479)). This argument is unpersuasive. In\nthe context of invoking the Miranda right to counsel, the\nCourt in Davis v. United States , 512 U. S. 452 , 459\n(1994), held that a suspect must do so “unambiguously.” If an\naccused makes a statement concerning the right to counsel “that is\nambiguous or equivocal” or makes no statement, the police are not\nrequired to end the interrogation, ibid. , or ask questions\nto clarify whether the accused wants to invoke his or her Miranda rights, 512 U. S., at 461–462. The Court has not yet stated whether an\ninvocation of the right to remain silent can be ambiguous or\nequivocal, but there is no principled reason to adopt different\nstandards for determining when an accused has invoked the Miranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to counsel at issue in Davis . See, e.g., Solem v. Stumes , 465 U. S. 638 , 648\n(1984) (“[M]uch of the logic and language of [Mosley] ,”\nwhich discussed the Miranda right to remain silent, “could\nbe applied to the invocation of the [ Miranda right to\ncounsel]”). Both protect the privilege against compulsory\nself-incrimination, Miranda , supra , at 467–473,\nby requiring an interrogation to cease when either right is\ninvoked, Mosley , supra , at 103 (citing Miranda , supra , at 474); Fare v. Michael C. , 442 U. S. 707 , 719\n(1979). There is good reason to require an accused who\nwants to invoke his or her right to remain silent to do so\nunambiguously. A requirement of an unambiguous invocation of Miranda rights results in an objective inquiry that\n“avoid[s] difficulties of proof and . . . provide[s] guidance to\nofficers” on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity. Davis , 512 U. S., at 458–459. If an ambiguous act,\nomission, or statement could require police to end the\ninterrogation, police would be required to make difficult decisions\nabout an accused’s unclear intent and face the consequence of\nsuppression “if they guess wrong.” Id. , at 461.\nSuppression of a voluntary confession in these circumstances would\nplace a significant burden on society’s interest in prosecuting\ncriminal activity. See id. , at 459–461; Moran v. Burbine , 475 U. S. 412 , 427\n(1986). Treating an ambiguous or equivocal act, omission, or\nstatement as an invocation of Miranda rights “might add\nmarginally to Miranda ’s goal of dispelling the compulsion\ninherent in custodial interrogation.” Burbine , 475 U. S.,\nat 425. But “as Miranda holds, full comprehension of the\nrights to remain silent and request an attorney are sufficient to\ndispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation process.” Id. , at 427; see Davis , supra , at\n460. Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain\nsilent or that he did not want to talk with the police. Had he made\neither of these simple, unambiguous statements, he would have\ninvoked his “ ‘right to cut off questioning.’ ” Mosley , supra , at 103 (quoting Miranda , supra , at 474). Here he did neither, so he did not invoke\nhis right to remain silent. B We next consider whether\nThompkins waived his right to remain silent. Even absent the\naccused’s invocation of the right to remain silent, the accused’s\nstatement during a custodial interrogation is inadmissible at trial\nunless the prosecution can establish that the accused “in fact\nknowingly and voluntarily waived [Miranda] rights” when\nmaking the statement. Butler , 441 U. S., at 373. The\nwaiver inquiry “has two distinct dimensions”: waiver must be\n“voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and\ndeliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or\ndeception,” and “made with a full awareness of both the nature of\nthe right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to\nabandon it.” Burbine , supra , at 421. Some language in Miranda could be read to indicate that waivers are difficult to establish\nabsent an explicit written waiver or a formal, express oral\nstatement. Miranda said “a valid waiver will not be\npresumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are\ngiven or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact\neventually obtained.” 384 U. S., at 475; see id. , at 470\n(“No effective waiver . . . can be recognized unless specifically\nmade after the [Miranda] warnings . . . have been given”).\nIn addition, the Miranda Court stated that “a heavy burden\nrests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly\nand intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination\nand his right to retained or appointed counsel.” Id. , at\n475. The course of decisions since Miranda , informed by the application of Miranda warnings in the whole course of law enforcement, demonstrates that\nwaivers can be established even absent formal or express statements\nof waiver that would be expected in, say, a judicial hearing to\ndetermine if a guilty plea has been properly entered. Cf. Fed. Rule\nCrim. Proc. 11. The main purpose of Miranda is to\nensure that an accused is advised of and understands the right to\nremain silent and the right to counsel. See Davis , supra , at 460; Burbine , supra , at 427.\nThus, “[i]f anything, our subsequent cases have reduced the impact\nof the Miranda rule on legitimate law enforcement while\nreaffirming the decision’s core ruling that unwarned statements may\nnot be used as evidence in the prosecution’s case in chief.” Dickerson v. United States , 530 U. S. 428 , 443–444\n(2000). One of the first cases to decide the meaning\nand import of Miranda with respect to the question of\nwaiver was North Carolina v. Butler . The Butler Court, after discussing some of the problems\ncreated by the language in Miranda , established certain\nimportant propositions. Butler interpreted the Miranda language concerning the “heavy burden” to show\nwaiver, 384 U. S., at 475, in accord with usual principles of\ndetermining waiver, which can include waiver implied from all the\ncircumstances. See Butler , supra , at 373, 376.\nAnd in a later case, the Court stated that this “heavy burden” is\nnot more than the burden to establish waiver by a preponderance of\nthe evidence. Colorado v. Connelly , 479 U. S. 157 , 168\n(1986). The prosecution therefore does not need to\nshow that a waiver of Miranda rights was express. An\n“implicit waiver” of the “right to remain silent” is sufficient to\nadmit a suspect’s statement into evidence. Butler , supra , at 376. Butler made clear that a waiver of Miranda rights may be implied through “the defendant’s\nsilence, coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course\nof conduct indicating waiver.” 441 U. S., at 373. The Court in Butler therefore “retreated” from the “language and tenor\nof the Miranda opinion,” which “suggested that the Court\nwould require that a waiver . . . be ‘specifically made.’ ” Connecticut v. Barrett , 479 U. S. 523 , 531–532\n(1987) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment). If the State establishes that a Miranda warning was given and the accused made an\nuncoerced statement, this showing, standing alone, is insufficient\nto demonstrate “a valid waiver” of Miranda rights. Miranda , supra , at 475. The prosecution must make\nthe additional showing that the accused understood these rights.\nSee Colorado v. Spring , 479 U. S. 564 , 573–575\n(1987); Barrett , supra , at 530; Burbine , supra , at 421–422. Cf. Tague v. Louisiana , 444 U. S. 469 , 469, 471\n(1980) (per curiam) (no evidence that accused understood\nhis Miranda rights); Carnley v. Cochran , 369 U. S. 506 ,\n516 (1962) (government could not show that accused\n“understandingly” waived his right to counsel in light of “silent\nrecord”). Where the prosecution shows that a Miranda warning was given and that it was understood by the accused, an\naccused’s uncoerced statement establishes an implied waiver of the\nright to remain silent. Although Miranda imposes on the\npolice a rule that is both formalistic and practical when it\nprevents them from interrogating suspects without first providing\nthem with a Miranda warning, see Burbine , 475 U.\nS., at 427, it does not impose a formalistic waiver procedure that\na suspect must follow to relinquish those rights. As a general\nproposition, the law can presume that an individual who, with a\nfull understanding of his or her rights, acts in a manner\ninconsistent with their exercise has made a deliberate choice to\nrelinquish the protection those rights afford. See, e.g., Butler , supra , at 372–376; Connelly , supra , at 169–170 (“There is obviously no reason to\nrequire more in the way of a ‘voluntariness’ inquiry in the Miranda waiver context than in the [due process]\nconfession context”). The Court’s cases have recognized that a\nwaiver of Miranda rights need only meet the standard of Johnson v. Zerbst , 304 U. S. 458 , 464\n(1938). See Butler , supra , at 374–375; Miranda , supra , at 475–476 (applying Zerbst standard of intentional relinquishment of a known\nright). As Butler recognized, 441 U. S., at 375–376, Miranda rights can therefore be waived through means less\nformal than a typical waiver on the record in a courtroom, cf. Fed.\nRule Crim. Proc. 11, given the practical constraints and\nnecessities of interrogation and the fact that Miranda ’s\nmain protection lies in advising defendants of their rights, see Davis , 512 U. S., at 460; Burbine , 475 U. S., at\n427. The record in this case shows that Thompkins\nwaived his right to remain silent. There is no basis in this case\nto conclude that he did not understand his rights; and on these\nfacts it follows that he chose not to invoke or rely on those\nrights when he did speak. First, there is no contention that\nThompkins did not understand his rights; and from this it foll",

CITY OF CHICAGO,\nILLINOIS certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the seventh circuit No. 08–974. Argued February 22, 2010—Decided May\n24, 2010 In 1995, respondent the City of Chicago gave a\nwritten examination to applicants seeking firefighter positions. In\nJanuary 1996, the City announced it would draw candidates randomly\nfrom a list of applicants who scored at least 89 out of 100 points\non the examination, whom it designated as “well qualified.” It\ninformed those who scored below 65 that they had failed and would\nnot be considered further. It informed applicants who scored\nbetween 65 and 88, whom it designated as “qualified,” that it was\nunlikely they would be called for further processing but that the\nCity would keep them on the eligibility list for as long as that\nlist was used. That May, the City selected its first class of\napplicants to advance, and it repeated this process multiple times\nover the next six years. Beginning in March 1997, several\nAfrican-American applicants who scored in the “qualified” range but\nhad not been hired filed discrimination charges with the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and received right-to-sue\nletters. They then filed suit, alleging (as relevant here) that the\nCity’s practice of selecting only applicants who scored 89 or above\nhad a disparate impact on African-Americans in violation of Title\nVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, see 42 U. S. C.\n§2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i). The District Court certified a\nclass—petitioners here—of African-Americans who scored in the\n“qualified” range but were not hired. The court denied the City’s\nsummary judgment motion, rejecting its claim that petitioners had\nfailed to file EEOC charges within 300 days “after the unlawful\nemployment practice occurred,” §2000e–5(e)(1), and finding instead\nthat the City’s “ongoing reliance” on the 1995 test results\nconstituted a continuing Title VII violation. The litigation then\nproceeded, and petitioners prevailed on the merits. The Seventh\nCircuit reversed the judgment in their favor, holding that the suit\nwas untimely because the earliest EEOC charge was filed more than\n300 days after the only discriminatory act—sorting the scores into\nthe “well qualified,” “qualified,” and “not qualified” categories.\nThe later hiring decisions, the Seventh Circuit held, were an\nautomatic consequence of the test scores, not new discriminatory\nacts. Held: A plaintiff who does not file a\ntimely charge challenging the adoption of a practice may\nassert a disparate-impact claim in a timely charge challenging the\nemployer’s later application of that practice as long as\nhe alleges each of the elements of a disparate-impact claim.\nPp. 4–11. (a) Determining whether\npetitioners’ charges were timely requires “identify[ing] precisely\nthe ‘unlawful employment practice’ of which” they complain. Delaware State College v. Ricks , 449 U. S. 250 , 257. With\nthe exception of the first selection round, all agree that the\nchallenged practice here—the City’s selection of firefighter hires\non the basis announced in 1996—occurred within the charging period.\nThus, the question is not whether a claim predicated on that\nconduct is timely , but whether the practice thus defined\ncan be the basis for a disparate-impact claim at all . It\ncan. A Title VII plaintiff establishes a prima facie claim by\nshowing that the employer “uses a particular employment practice\nthat causes a disparate impact” on one of the prohibited bases.\n§2000e–2(k). The term “employment practice” clearly encompasses the\nconduct at issue: exclusion of passing applicants who scored below\n89 when selecting those who would advance. The City “use[d]” that\npractice each time it filled a new class of firefighters, and\npetitioners allege that doing so caused a disparate impact. It is\nirrelevant that subsection (k) does not address “accrual” of\ndisparate-impact claims, since the issue here is not when the\nclaims accrued but whether the claims stated a violation. They did.\nWhether petitioners proved a violation is not before the Court.\nPp. 4–7. (b) The City argues that the only\nactionable discrimination occurred in 1996 when it used the test\nresults to create the hiring list, which it concedes was unlawful.\nIt may be true that the City’s adoption in 1996 of the cutoff score\ngave rise to a freestanding disparate-impact claim. If so, because\nno timely charge was filed, the City is now “entitled to treat that\npast act as lawful,” United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans , 431\nU. S. 553 , 558. But it does not follow that no new violation\noccurred—and no new claims could arise—when the City later\nimplemented the 1996 decision. Evans and later cases the\nCity cites establish only that a Title VII plaintiff must show a\n“present violation” within the limitations period. For\ndisparate-treatment claims—which require discriminatory intent—the\nplaintiff must demonstrate deliberate discrimination within the\nlimitations period. But no such demonstration is needed for claims,\nsuch as this one, that do not require discriminatory intent. Cf., e.g., Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber\nCo. , 550 U. S.\n618 , 640. Contrary to the Seventh Circuit’s reasoning, even if\nboth types of claims take aim at prohibited discrimination, it does\nnot follow that their reach is coextensive. Pp. 7–10. (c) The City and its amici warn\nthat this reading will result in a host of practical problems for\nemployers and employees alike. The Court, however, must give effect\nto the law Congress enacted, not assess the consequences of each\napproach and adopt the one that produces the least mischief.\nPp. 10–11. (d) It is left to the Seventh Circuit to\ndetermine whether the judgment must be modified to the extent that\nthe District Court awarded relief based on the first round of\nhiring, which occurred outside the charging period even for the\nearliest EEOC charge. P. 11. 528 F. 3d 488, reversed and remanded. Scalia, J., delivered the opinion\nfor a unanimous Court. OPINION OF THE COURT LEWIS V. CHICAGO 560 U. S. ____ (2010) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 08-974 ARTHUR L. LEWIS, Jr., et al., PETITIONERS v. CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the seventh circuit [May 24, 2010] Justice Scalia delivered the\nopinion of the Court. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964 prohibits employers from using employment practices that\ncause a disparate impact on the basis of race (among other bases).\n42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i). It also requires plaintiffs,\nbefore beginning a federal lawsuit, to file a timely charge of\ndiscrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n(EEOC). §2000e–5(e)(1). We consider whether a plaintiff who does\nnot file a timely charge challenging the adoption of a\npractice—here, an employer’s decision to exclude employment\napplicants who did not achieve a certain score on an\nexamination—may assert a disparate-impact claim in a timely charge\nchallenging the employer’s later application of that\npractice. I In July 1995, the City of Chicago\nadministered a written examination to over 26,000 applicants\nseeking to serve in the Chicago Fire Department. After scoring the\nexaminations, the City reported the results. It announced in a\nJanuary 26, 1996, press release that it would begin drawing\nrandomly from the top tier of scorers, i.e. , those who\nscored 89 or above (out of 100), whom the City called “well\nqualified.” Those drawn from this group would proceed to the next\nphase—a physical-abilities test, background check, medical\nexamination, and drug test—and if they cleared those hurdles would\nbe hired as candidate firefighters. Those who scored below 65, on\nthe other hand, learned by letters sent the same day that they had\nfailed the test. Each was told he had not achieved a passing score,\nwould no longer be considered for a firefighter position, and would\nnot be contacted again about the examination. The applicants in-between—those\nwho scored between 65 and 88, whom the City called\n“qualified”[ Footnote 1 ]—were\nnotified that they had passed the examination but that, based on\nthe City’s projected hiring needs and the number of\n“well-qualified” applicants, it was not likely they would be called\nfor further processing. The individual notices added, however, that\nbecause it was not possible to predict how many applicants would be\nhired in the next few years, each “qualified” applicant’s name\nwould be kept on the eligibility list maintained by the Department\nof Personnel for as long as that list was used. Eleven days later,\nthe City officially adopted an “Eligible List” reflecting the\nbreakdown described above. On May 16, 1996, the City selected its first\nclass of applicants to advance to the next stage. It selected a\nsecond on October 1, 1996, and repeated the process nine more times\nover the next six years. As it had announced, in each round the\nCity drew randomly from among those who scored in the\n“well-qualified” range on the 1995 test. In the last round it\nexhausted that pool, so it filled the remaining slots with\n“qualified” candidates instead. On March 31, 1997, Crawford M. Smith, an\nAfrican-American applicant who scored in the “qualified” range and\nhad not been hired as a candidate firefighter, filed a charge of\ndiscrimination with the EEOC. Five others followed suit, and on\nJuly 28, 1998, the EEOC issued all six of them right-to-sue\nletters. Two months later, they filed this civil action against the\nCity, alleging (as relevant here) that its practice of selecting\nfor advancement only applicants who scored 89 or above caused a\ndisparate impact on African-Americans in violation of Title VII.\nThe District Court certified a class—petitioners here—consisting of\nthe more than 6,000 African-Americans who scored in the “qualified”\nrange on the 1995 examination but had not been hired.[ Footnote 2 ] The City sought summary judgment on the ground\nthat petitioners had failed to file EEOC charges within 300 days\nafter their claims accrued. See §2000e–5(e)(1). The District Court\ndenied the motion, concluding that the City’s “ongoing reliance” on\nthe 1995 test results constituted a “continuing violation” of Title\nVII. App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a. The City stipulated that the\n89-point cutoff had a “severe disparate impact against African\nAmericans,” Final Pretrial Order, Record, Doc. 223, Schedule A, p.\n2, but argued that its cutoff score was justified by business\nnecessity. After an 8-day bench trial, the District Court ruled for\npetitioners, rejecting the City’s business-necessity defense. It\nordered the City to hire 132 randomly selected members of the class\n(reflecting the number of African-Americans the Court found would\nhave been hired but for the City’s practices) and awarded backpay\nto be divided among the remaining class members. The Seventh Circuit reversed. 528 F. 3d\n488 (2008). It held that petitioners’ suit was untimely because the\nearliest EEOC charge was filed more than 300 days after the only\ndiscriminatory act: sorting the scores into the “well-qualified,”\n“qualified,” and “not-qualified” categories. The hiring decisions\ndown the line were immaterial, it reasoned, because “[t]he hiring\nonly of applicants classified ‘well qualified’ was the automatic\nconsequence of the test scores rather than the product of a fresh\nact of discrimination.” Id. , at 491. We granted\ncertiorari. 557 U. S. __ (2009). II A Before beginning a Title VII\nsuit, a plaintiff must first file a timely EEOC charge. In this\ncase, petitioners’ charges were due within 300 days “after the\nalleged unlawful employment practice occurred.”\n§2000e–5(e)(1).[ Footnote 3 ]\nDetermining whether a plaintiff’s charge is timely thus requires\n“identify[ing] precisely the ‘unlawful employment practice’ of\nwhich he complains.” Delaware State College v. Ricks , 449 U. S. 250 , 257 (1980). Petitioners\nhere challenge the City’s practice of picking only those who had\nscored 89 or above on the 1995 examination when it later chose\napplicants to advance. Setting aside the first round of selection\nin May 1996, which all agree is beyond the cut-off, no one disputes\nthat the conduct petitioners challenge occurred within the charging\nperiod.[ Footnote 4 ] The real\nquestion, then, is not whether a claim predicated on that conduct\nis timely , but whether the practice thus defined can be\nthe basis for a disparate-impact claim at all . We conclude that it can. As\noriginally enacted, Title VII did not expressly prohibit employment\npractices that cause a disparate impact. That enactment made it an\n“unlawful employment practice” for an employer “to fail or refuse\nto hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to\ndiscriminate against any individual with respect to his\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin,” §2000e–2(a)(1), or “to limit, segregate, or\nclassify his employees or applicants for employment in any way\nwhich would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\nopportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\nemployee, because of” any of the same reasons, §2000e–2(a)(2). In Griggs v. Duke Power Co. , 401 U. S. 424 , 431\n(1971), we interpreted the latter provision to “proscrib[e] not\nonly overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form,\nbut discriminatory in operation.” Two decades later, Congress codified the\nrequirements of the “disparate impact” claims Griggs had\nrecognized. Pub. L. 102–166, §105, 105 Stat. 1074, 42 U. S. C.\n§2000e–2(k). That provision states: “(1)(A) An unlawful employment practice based on\ndisparate impact is established under this subchapter only if— “(i) a complaining party demonstrates that a respondent uses a\nparticular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on\nthe basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and the\nrespondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job\nrelated for the position in question and consistent with business\nnecessity … .” Thus, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie\ndisparate-impact claim by showing that the employer “ uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact” on\none of the prohibited bases. Ibid. (emphasis added). See Ricci v. DeStefano , 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 18). Petitioners’ claim satisfies that requirement.\nTitle VII does not define “employment practice,” but we think it\nclear that the term encompasses the conduct of which petitioners\ncomplain: the exclusion of passing applicants who scored below 89\n(until the supply of scores 89 or above was exhausted) when\nselecting those who would advance. The City “use[d]” that practice\nin each round of selection. Although the City had adopted the\neligibility list (embodying the score cutoffs) earlier and\nannounced its intention to draw from that list, it made use of the\npractice of excluding those who scored 88 or below each time it\nfilled a new class of firefighters. Petitioners alleged that this\nexclusion caused a disparate impact. Whether they adequately proved\nthat is not before us. What matters is that their allegations,\nbased on the City’s actual implementation of its policy, stated a\ncognizable claim. The City argues that subsection (k) is\ninapposite because it does not address “accrual” of\ndisparate-impact claims. Section 2000e–5(e)(1), it says, specifies\nwhen the time to file a charge starts running. That is true but\nirrelevant. Aside from the first round of selection in May 1996\n(which all agree is beyond the 300-day charging period), the acts\npetitioners challenge—the City’s use of its cutoff score in\nselecting candidates—occurred within the charging period.\nAccordingly, no one disputes that if petitioners could bring new\nclaims based on those acts, their claims were timely. The issue, in\nother words, is not when petitioners’ claims accrued, but whether they could accrue at all. The City responds that subsection (k) does not\nanswer that question either; that it speaks, as its title\nindicates, only to the plaintiff’s “[b]urden of proof in disparate\nimpact cases,” not to the elements of disparate-impact claims,\nwhich the City says are be found in §2000e–2(a)(2). That is\nincorrect. Subsection (k) does indeed address the burden of\nproof—not just who bears it, however, but also what it consists of.\nIt does set forth the essential ingredients of a\ndisparate-impact claim: It says that a claim “is established” if an\nemployer “uses” an “employment practice” that “causes a disparate\nimpact” on one of the enumerated bases. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i). That\nit also sets forth a business-necessity defense employers may\nraise, §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i), and explains how plaintiffs may\nprevail despite that defense, §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(ii), is irrelevant.\nUnless and until the defendant pleads and proves a\nbusiness-necessity defense, the plaintiff wins simply by showing\nthe stated elements. B Notwithstanding the text of\n§2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i) and petitioners’ description of the practice\nthey claim was unlawful, the City argues that the unlawful\nemployment practice here was something else entirely. The only\nactionable discrimination, it argues, occurred in 1996 when it\n“used the examination results to create the hiring eligibility\nlist, limited hiring to the ‘well qualified’ classification, and\nnotified petitioners.” Brief for Respondent 23. That initial\ndecision, it concedes, was unlawful. But because no timely charge\nchallenged the decision, that cannot now be the basis for\nliability. And because, the City claims, the exclusion of\npetitioners when selecting classes of firefighters followed\ninevitably from the earlier decision to adopt the cutoff score, no\nnew violations could have occurred. The Seventh Circuit adopted the\nsame analysis. See 528 F. 3d, at 490–491. The City’s premise is sound, but\nits conclusion does not follow. It may be true that the City’s\nJanuary 1996 decision to adopt the cutoff score (and to create a\nlist of the applicants above it) gave rise to a freestanding\ndisparate-impact claim. Cf. Connecticut v. Teal , 457 U. S. 440 ,\n445–451 (1982). If that is so, the City is correct that since no\ntimely charge was filed attacking it, the City is now “entitled to\ntreat that past act as lawful.” United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans , 431\nU. S. 553 , 558 (1977). But it does not follow that no new\nviolation occurred—and no new claims could arise—when the City\nimplemented that decision down the road. If petitioners could prove\nthat the City “use[d]” the “practice” that “causes a disparate\nimpact,” they could prevail. The City, like the Seventh Circuit, see 528\nF. 3d, at 490–491, insists that Evans and a line of\ncases following it require a different result. See also Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. , 550 U. S. 618 (2007); Lorance v. AT&T Technologies, Inc. , 490 U. S. 900 (1989); Ricks , 449 U. S. 250 . Those cases, we are\ntold, stand for the proposition that present effects of prior\nactions cannot lead to Title VII liability. We disagree. As relevant here, those cases\nestablish only that a Title VII plaintiff must show a “present\nviolation” within the limitations period. Evans , supra , at 558 (emphasis deleted). What that requires\ndepends on the claim asserted. For disparate-treatment claims—and\nothers for which discriminatory intent is required—that means the\nplaintiff must demonstrate deliberate discrimination within the\nlimitations period. See Ledbetter , supra , at\n624–629; Lorance , supra , at 904–905; Ricks , supra , at 256–258; Evans , supra , at 557–560; see also Chardon v. Fernandez , 454 U. S. 6 , 8 (1981) (per curiam) . But for claims that do not require\ndiscriminatory intent, no such demonstration is needed. Cf. Ledbetter , supra , at 640; Lorance , supra , at 904, 908–909. Our opinions, it is true,\ndescribed the harms of which the unsuccessful plaintiffs in those\ncases complained as “present effect[s]” of past discrimination. Ledbetter , supra , at 628; see also Lorance , supra , at 907; Chardon , supra , at 8; Ricks , supra , at 258; Evans , supra , at 558. But the reason they could\nnot be the present effects of present discrimination was that the\ncharged discrimination required proof of discriminatory intent,\nwhich had not even been alleged. That reasoning has no application\nwhen, as here, the charge is disparate impact, which does not\nrequire discriminatory intent. The Seventh Circuit resisted this conclusion,\nreasoning that the difference between disparate-treatment and\ndisparate-impact claims is only superficial. Both take aim at the\nsame evil—discrimination on a prohibited basis—but simply seek to\nestablish it by different means. 528 F. 3d, at 491–492.\nDisparate-impact liability, the Court of Appeals explained,\n“ ‘is primarily intended to lighten the plaintiff’s heavy\nburden of proving intentional discrimination after employers\nlearned to cover their tracks.’ ” Id. , at 492\n(quoting Finnegan v. Trans World Airlines , Inc. , 967 F. 2d 1161, 1164 (CA7 1992)). But even if\nthe two theories were directed at the same evil, it would not\nfollow that their reach is therefore coextensive. If the effect of\napplying Title VII’s text is that some claims that would be doomed\nunder one theory will survive under the other, that is the product\nof the law Congress has written. It is not for us to rewrite the\nstatute so that it covers only what we think is necessary to\nachieve what we think Congress really intended. See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc. , 523 U. S. 75 , 79–80\n(1998). The City also argues that, even if petitioners\ncould have proved a present disparate-impact violation, they never\ndid so under the proper test. The parties litigated the merits—and\nthe City stipulated that the cutoff score caused disparate\nimpact—after the District Court adopted petitioners’ “continuing\nviolation” theory. App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a. That theory, which\npetitioners have since abandoned, treated the adoption and\napplication of the cutoff score as a single, ongoing wrong. As a\nresult, the City says, “petitioners never proved, or even attempted\nto prove, that use of the [eligibility] list had disparate\nimpact,” Brief for Respondent 32 (emphasis added), since the theory\nthey advanced did not require them to do so. If the Court of\nAppeals determines that the argument has been preserved it may be\navailable on remand. But it has no bearing here. The only question\npresented to us is whether the claim petitioners brought is\ncognizable. Because we conclude that it is, our inquiry is at an\nend. C The City and its amici warn that our reading will result in a host of practical problems\nfor employers and employees alike. Employers may face new\ndisparate-impact suits for practices they have used regularly for\nyears. Evidence essential to their business-necessity defenses\nmight be unavailable (or in the case of witnesses’ memories,\nunreliable) by the time the later suits are brought. And affected\nemployees and prospective employees may not even know they have\nclaims if they are unaware the employer is still applying the\ndisputed practice. Truth to tell, however, both\nreadings of the statute produce puzzling results. Under the City’s\nreading, if an employer adopts an unlawful practice and no timely\ncharge is brought, it can continue using the practice indefinitely,\nwith impunity, despite ongoing disparate impact. Equitable tolling\nor estoppel may allow some affected employees or applicants to sue,\nbut many others will be left out in the cold. Moreover, the City’s\nreading may induce plaintiffs aware of the danger of delay to file\ncharges upon the announcement of a hiring practice, before they\nhave any basis for believing it will produce a disparate\nimpact. In all events, it is not our task to assess\nthe consequences of each approach and adopt the one that produces\nthe least mischief. Our charge is to give effect to the law\nCongress enacted. By enacting §2000e–2(k)(1)(A)(i), Congress\nallowed claims to be brought against an employer who uses a\npractice that causes disparate impact, whatever the employer’s\nmotives and whether or not he has employed the same practice in the\npast. If that effect was unintended, it is a problem for Congress,\nnot one that federal courts can fix. III The City asserts that one aspect\nof the District Court’s judgment still must be changed. The first\nround of hiring firefighters occurred outside the charging period\neven for the earliest EEOC charge. Yet the District Court, applying\nthe continuing-violation theory, awarded relief based on those\nacts. Petitioners do not disagree, and they do not oppose the\nCity’s request for a remand to resolve this issue. We therefore\nleave it to the Seventh Circuit to determine, to the extent that\npoint was properly preserved, whether the judgment must be modified\nin light of our decision. *  *  * The judgment of the Court of\nAppeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Footnote 1 Certain paramedics who scored between 65 and\n88 were deemed “well qualified” pursuant to a collective-bargaining\nagreement, and certain veterans in the “qualified” range had 5\npoints added to their scores and therefore became “well\nqualified.” Footnote 2 In addition to the class members, the African\nAmerican Fire Fighters League of Chicago, Inc., also joined the\nsuit as a plaintiff. Footnote 3 All agree that a 300-day deadline applies to\npetitioners’ charges pursuant to 29 CFR §§1601.13(a)(4), (b)(1),\n1601.80 (2009). Cf. EEOC v. Commercial Office Products\nCo. , 486 U. S.\n107 , 112, 114–122 (1988). Footnote 4 Because the District Court certified\npetitioners as a class, and because a court may award class-wide\nrelief even to unnamed class members who have not filed EEOC\ncharges, see Franks v. Bowman Transp. Co. , 424 U. S. 747 ,\n771 (1976), petitioners assert and the City does not dispute that\nthe date of the earliest EEOC charge filed by a named\nplaintiff—that filed by Smith on March 31, 1997—controls the\ntimeliness of the class’s claims. We assume without deciding that\nthis is correct.",

BUONO certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the ninth circuit No. 08–472. Argued October 7, 2009—Decided April\n28, 2010 In 1934, members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars\n(VFW) placed a Latin cross on federal land in the Mojave National\nPreserve (Preserve) to honor American soldiers who died in World\nWar I. Claiming to be offended by a religious symbol’s presence on\nfederal land, respondent Buono, a regular visitor to the Preserve,\nfiled this suit alleging a violation of the First Amendment’s\nEstablishment Clause and seeking an injunction requiring the\nGovernment to remove the cross. In the litigation’s first stage (Buono I) , the District Court found that Buono had\nstanding to sue and, concluding that the presence of the cross on\nfederal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of\nreligion, see Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U. S. 602 , 612–613,\nit granted Buono’s requested injunctive relief (2002 injunction).\nThe District Court did not consider whether the Government’s\nactions regarding the cross had a secular purpose or caused\nentanglement with religion. While the Government’s appeal was\npending, Congress passed the Department of Defense Appropriations\nAct, 2004, §8121(a) of which directed the Secretary of the Interior\nto transfer the cross and the land on which it stands to the VFW in\nexchange for privately owned land elsewhere in the Preserve\n(land-transfer statute). Affirming the District Court’s judgment\nboth as to standing and on the merits, the Ninth Circuit declined\nto address the statute’s effect on Buono’s suit or the statute’s\nconstitutionality (Buono II). Because the Government did\nnot seek review by this Court, the Court of Appeals’ judgment\nbecame final. Buono then returned to the District Court seeking\ninjunctive relief against the land transfer, either through\nenforcement or modification of the 2002 injunction. In 2005, that\ncourt rejected the Government’s claim that the transfer was a bona\nfide attempt to comply with the injunction, concluding, instead,\nthat it was actually an invalid attempt to keep the cross on\ndisplay. The court granted Buono’s motion to enforce the 2002\ninjunction; denied as moot his motion to amend it; and permanently\nenjoined the Government from implementing the land-transfer statute (Buono III). The Ninth Circuit again affirmed, largely\nfollowing the District Court’s reasoning . Held: The judgment is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded. 502 F. 3d 1069 and 527 F. 3d 758,\nreversed and remanded. Justice Kennedy, joined in full\nby The Chief Justice and in part by Justice Alito, concluded: 1. Buono has standing to maintain this\naction. Whatever the validity of the Government’s argument that\nBuono’s asserted injury—offense at a religious symbol’s presence on\nfederal land—is not personal to him and so does not confer Article\nIII standing, that argument is not available at this stage of the\nlitigation. The District Court rejected the argument in Buono\nI, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in Buono II, and the\nCourt of Appeals’ judgment became final and unreviewable upon the\nexpiration of the 90-day deadline for filing a certiorari petition,\n28 U. S. C. §2101(c). Moreover, Buono had standing in Buono III to seek application of the injunction against\nthe land-transfer statute. A party that obtains a judgment in its\nfavor acquires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring\ncompliance with that judgment. See Allen v. Wright , 468\nU. S. 737 . Buono’s entitlement to an injunction having been\nestablished in Buono I and II , he sought in Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating or\nevading that injunction. His interests in doing so were\nsufficiently personal and concrete to support his standing, given\nthe rights he obtained under the earlier decree against the same\nparty as to the same cross and the same land. The Government’s\ncontention that Buono sought to extend, rather than to enforce, the\n2002 injunction is not an argument about standing, but about the\nmerits of the District Court’s order. Pp. 7–9. 2. The District Court erred in enjoining\nthe Government from implementing the land-transfer statute on the\npremise that the relief was necessary to protect Buono’s rights\nunder the 2002 injunction. Pp. 9–18. (a) A court may order\nan injunction only after taking into account all the circumstances\nbearing on the need for prospective relief. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Swift & Co. , 286 U. S. 106 , 114.\nHere, the District Court did not engage in the appropriate inquiry.\nThe land-transfer statute was a substantial change in circumstances\nbearing on the propriety of the requested relief. By dismissing as\nillicit the motives of Congress in passing it, the District Court\ntook insufficient account of the context in which the statute was\nenacted and the reasons for its passage. Placement of the cross on\nfederal land by private persons was not an attempt to set the\nstate’s imprimatur on a particular creed. Rather, the\nintent was simply to honor fallen soldiers. Moreover, the cross\nstood for nearly seven decades before the statute was enacted, by\nwhich time the cross and the cause it commemorated had become\nentwined in the public consciousness. The 2002 injunction thus\npresented the Government with a dilemma. It could not maintain the\ncross without violating the injunction, but it could not remove the\ncross without conveying disrespect for those the cross was seen as\nhonoring. Deeming neither alternative satisfactory, Congress\nenacted the land-transfer statute. The statute embodied a\nlegislative judgment that this dispute is best resolved through a\nframework and policy of accommodation. The statute should not have\nbeen dismissed as an evasion, for it brought about a change of law\nand a congressional statement of policy applicable to the case.\nPp. 9–13. (b) Where legislative\naction undermines the basis for previous relief, the relevant\nquestion is whether an ongoing exercise of the court’s equitable\nauthority is supported by the prior showing of illegality, judged\nagainst the claim that changed circumstances render prospective\nrelief inappropriate. The District Court granted the 2002\ninjunction based solely on its conclusion that the presence of the\ncross on federal land conveyed an impression of governmental\nendorsement of religion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed on the same\ngrounds. Neither court considered whether the Government had acted\nbased on an improper purpose. Given this sole reliance on\nperception, any further relief grounded on the injunction should\nhave rested on the same basis. But the District Court used an\ninjunction granted for one reason (perceived governmental\nendorsement) as the basis for enjoining conduct that was alleged to\nbe objectionable for a different reason (an illicit governmental\npurpose). Ordering relief under such circumstances was improper.\nThe court failed to consider whether the change in law and\ncircumstances effected by the land-transfer statute had rendered\nthe “reasonable observer” standard inappropriate to resolve the\ndispute. Nor did the court attempt to reassess Buono I ’s\nfindings in light of the accommodation policy embraced by Congress.\nRather, it concentrated solely on the religious aspects of the\ncross, divorced from its background and context.\nPp. 13–17. (c) The same respect\nfor a coordinate branch of Government that forbids striking down an\nAct of Congress except upon a clear showing of unconstitutionality,\nsee, e.g., United States v. Morrison , 529 U. S. 598 , 607,\nrequires that a congressional command be given effect unless no\nlegal alternative exists. Even if, contrary to the congressional\njudgment, the land transfer were thought an insufficient\naccommodation in light of the earlier endorsement finding, it was\nincumbent upon the District Court to consider less drastic relief\nthan complete invalidation of the statute. See, e.g.,\nAyotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng. , 546 U. S. 320 ,\n329. On remand, that court should conduct a proper inquiry into the\ncontinued necessity for injunctive relief in light of the statute.\nPp. 17–18. Justice Alito concluded that this case should\nnot be remanded for the lower courts to decide whether\nimplementation of the land-transfer statute would violate the\nDistrict Court’s injunction or the Establishment Clause. Rather,\nbecause the factual record has been sufficiently developed to\npermit resolution of these questions, he would decide them and hold\nthat the statute may be implemented. The case’s singular\ncircumstances presented Congress with a delicate problem. Its\nsolution was an approach designed to eliminate any perception of\nreligious sponsorship stemming from the location of the cross on\nfederally owned land, while avoiding the disturbing symbolism that\nsome would associate with the destruction of this historic\nmonument. The mechanism Congress selected is quite common in the\nWest, a “land exchange,” whereby ownership of the land on which the\ncross is located would be transferred to the VFW in exchange for\nanother nearby parcel of equal value. The land transfer would not\nviolate the District Court injunction, the obvious meaning of which\nwas simply that the Government could not allow the cross to remain\non federal land. Nor would the statute’s implementation\nconstitute an endorsement of religion in violation of the\nEstablishment Clause. The so-called “endorsement test” views a\nchallenged religious display through the eyes of a hypothetical\nreasonable observer aware of the history and all other pertinent\nfacts relating to the display. Here, therefore, this observer would\nbe familiar with the monument’s origin and history and thereby\nappreciate that the transfer represents an effort by Congress to\naddress a unique situation and to find a solution that best\naccommodates conflicting concerns. Finally, the statute was not\nenacted for the illicit purpose of embracing the monument’s\nreligious message but to commemorate the Nation’s war dead and to\navoid the disturbing symbolism that would have been created by the\nmonument’s destruction. Pp. 1–7. Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas,\nconcluded that this Court need not—indeed, cannot —decide\nthis case’s merits because Buono lacks Article III standing to\npursue the relief he seeks, which is not enforcement of the\noriginal injunction but expansion of it. By enjoining the\nGovernment from implementing the statute at issue, the District\nCourt’s 2005 order went well beyond the original injunction’s\nproscription of the cross’s display on public property. Because\nBuono seeks new relief, he must show that he has standing to pursue\nthat relief by demonstrating that blocking the land transfer will\n“redress or prevent an actual or imminently threatened injury to\n[him] caused by private or official violation of law.” Summers v. Earth Island Institute , 555 U. S. ___,\n___. He has failed, however, to allege any such injury. Even\nassuming that being offended by a religious display constitutes a\ncognizable injury, it is merely speculative whether the cross will\nremain in place, and in any event Buono has made clear, by\nadmitting he has no objection to Christian symbols on private\nproperty, that he will not be offended. Neither district\ncourts’ discretion to expand injunctions they have issued nor this\nDistrict Court’s characterization of its 2005 order as merely\nenforcing the existing injunction makes any difference. If in fact\na court awards new relief, it must have Article III jurisdiction to\ndo so. Pp. 1–7.

S. ____ (2010) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 08-472 KEN L. SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR,\net al., PETITIONERS v. FRANK BUONO on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit [April 28, 2010] Justice Kennedy announced the\njudgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief\nJustice joins and Justice Alito joins in part. In 1934, private citizens placed\na Latin cross on a rock outcropping in a remote section of the\nMojave Desert. Their purpose and intent was to honor American\nsoldiers who fell in World War I. The original cross deteriorated\nover time, but a reconstructed one now stands at the same place. It\nis on federal land. The Court is asked to consider a challenge,\nnot to the first placement of the cross or its continued presence\non federal land, but to a statute that would transfer the cross and\nthe land on which it stands to a private party. Department of\nDefense Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108–87, §8121(a), 117\nStat. 1100. The District Court permanently enjoined the Government\nfrom implementing the statute. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We\nconclude that its judgment was in error. I A The Mojave National Preserve\n(Preserve) spans approximately 1.6 million acres in southeastern\nCalifornia. The Preserve is nestled within the Mojave Desert, whose\npicturesque but rugged territory comprises 25,000 square miles,\nexceeding in size the combined area of the Nation’s five smallest\nStates. See Merriam-Webster’s Geographical Dictionary 755,\n1228–1230 (3d ed. 1997). Just over 90 percent of the land in the\nPreserve is federally owned, with the rest owned either by the\nState of California or by private parties. The National Park\nService, a division of the Department of the Interior, administers\nthe Preserve as part of the National Park System. 16 U. S. C.\n§§410aaa–41 and 410aaa–46. Sunrise Rock is a granite\noutcropping located within the Preserve. Sunrise Rock and the area\nin its immediate vicinity are federal land, but two private ranches\nare located less than two miles away. The record does not indicate\nwhether fencing is used to mark the boundary of these ranches. In\n1934, members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) mounted a Latin\ncross on the rock as a memorial to soldiers who died in World War\nI. A Latin cross consists of two bars—a vertical one and a shorter,\nhorizontal one. The cross has been replaced or repaired at various\ntimes over the years, most recently in 1998 by Henry Sandoz. Sandoz\nis a private citizen who owns land elsewhere in the Preserve, a\nportion of which he is prepared to transfer to the Government in\nreturn for its conveyance to the VFW of the land on which the cross\nstands, all pursuant to the statute now under review. The cross, as built by Sandoz, consists of\n4-inch diameter metal pipes painted white. The vertical bar is less\nthan eight feet tall. It cannot be seen from the nearest highway,\nwhich lies more than 10 miles away. It is visible, however, from\nCima Road, a narrow stretch of blacktop that comes within 100 feet\nof Sunrise Rock. The cross has been a gathering place for\nEaster services since it was first put in place; and Sunrise Rock\nand its immediate area continue to be used as a campsite. At one\ntime the cross was accompanied by wooden signs stating “ ‘The\nCross, Erected in Memory of the Dead of All Wars,’ and ‘Erected\n1934 by Members of Veterans of Foregin [sic] Wars, Death Valley\npost 2884.’ ” Buono v. Kempthorne , 527\nF. 3d 758, 769 (CA9 2008). The signs have since disappeared,\nand the cross now stands unmarked. B Frank Buono, respondent here, is\na retired Park Service employee who makes regular visits to the\nPreserve. Buono claims to be offended by the presence of a\nreligious symbol on federal land. He filed suit in the United\nStates District Court for the Central District of California. He\nalleged a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First\nAmendment and sought an injunction requiring the Government to\nremove the cross. The litigation proceeded in what\ncan be described as four stages. In the first, the District Court\nruled in Buono’s favor on opposing motions for summary judgment. Buono v. Norton , 212 F. Supp. 2d 1202 (CD\nCal. 2002) (Buono I) . As an initial matter, the court\nfound that Buono had standing to maintain his Establishment Clause\nchallenge. Id., at 1210–1214. On the merits, the parties\nagreed that the dispute should be governed by the so-called Lemon test, which the District Court formulated as\nfollows: “A government religious practice or symbol will\nsurvive an Establishment Clause challenge when it (1) has a\nsecular purpose, (2) has a primary effect that neither advances nor\ninhibits religion, and (3) does not foster excessive state\nentanglement with religion.” Buono I , supra , at\n1214–1215 (citing Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U. S. 602 , 612–613\n(1971)). The court expressly declined to consider whether\nthe Government’s actions regarding the cross had a secular purpose,\n212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1214–1215, or whether they caused\nexcessive entanglement with religion, id., at 1217,\nn. 9. Instead, the court evaluated the primary effect of the\ncross by asking how it would be viewed by a “reasonable observer.” Id., at 1216. Concluding that presence of the cross on\nfederal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of\nreligion, the court granted Buono’s request for injunctive relief.\nThe court’s order in Buono I (2002 injunction) permanently\nforbade the Government “from permitting the display of the Latin\ncross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 146a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit stayed the 2002 injunction to the extent that it\nrequired the cross to be removed or dismantled but did not forbid\nalternative methods of complying with the order. The Government\ncovered the cross, first with a tarpaulin and later with a plywood\nbox. On appeal, the judgment of the District Court\nwas affirmed, both as to standing and on the merits of Buono’s\nEstablishment Clause challenge. Buono v. Norton ,\n371 F. 3d 543 (CA9 2004) (Buono II) . Like the\nDistrict Court, the Court of Appeals did not decide whether the\nGovernment’s action, or nonaction, with respect to the cross had\nbeen motivated by a secular purpose. Id., at 550. Its\nruling was based instead on the conclusion that a reasonable\nobserver would perceive a cross on federal land as governmental\nendorsement of religion. Id., at 549–550. The Government\ndid not seek review by this Court, so that the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals in Buono II became final. C During the relevant proceedings,\nCongress enacted certain statutes related to the cross: (1) Before Buono I was\nfiled, Congress passed an appropriations bill that included a\nprovision forbidding the use of governmental funds to remove the\ncross. Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. 106–554,\n§133, 114 Stat. 2763A–230. (2) While Buono I was pending before\nthe District Court, Congress designated the cross and its adjoining\nland “as a national memorial commemorating United States\nparticipation in World War I and honoring the American veterans of\nthat war.” Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2002, Pub. L.\n107–117, §8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278. The Secretary of the Interior\nwas directed to expend up to $10,000 to acquire a replica of the\noriginal cross and its memorial plaque and to install the plaque at\na suitable nearby location. §8137(c). (3) Three months after Buono I was\ndecided, Congress again prohibited the spending of governmental\nfunds to remove the cross. Department of Defense Appropriations\nAct, 2003, Pub. L. 107–248, §8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551. (4) While the Government’s appeal in Buono\nII was pending, Congress passed a statute (land-transfer\nstatute) directing the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the\nVFW the Government’s interest in the land that had been designated\na national memorial. Department of Defense Appropriations Act,\n2004, Pub. L. 108–87, §8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100. In exchange, the\nGovernment was to receive land elsewhere in the preserve from Henry\nSandoz and his wife. Ibid. Any difference in value between\nthe two parcels would be equalized through a cash payment.\n§§8121(c), (d). The land-transfer statute provided that the\nproperty would revert to the Government if not maintained “as a\nmemorial commemorating United States participation in World War I\nand honoring the American veterans of that war.” §8121(e), 117\nStat. 1100. The statute presents a central issue in this case. The Court of Appeals in Buono II did\nnot address the effect on the suit of a potential land transfer\nunder the statute. The court noted that the transfer might “take as\nlong as two years to complete,” 371 F. 3d, at 545, and that\nits effect was not yet known, id., at 545–546. The court\nthus “express[ed] no view as to whether a transfer completed under\n[the statute] would pass constitutional muster.” Id., at\n546. D After the Court of Appeals\naffirmed in Buono II , Buono returned to the District Court\nseeking to prevent the land transfer. He sought injunctive relief\nagainst the transfer, either through enforcement or modification of\nthe 2002 injunction. In evaluating his request the trial court\ndescribed the relevant question as whether the land transfer was a\nbona fide attempt to comply with the injunction (as the Government\nclaimed), or a sham aimed at keeping the cross in place (as Buono\nclaimed). Buono v. Norton , 364 F. Supp. 2d\n1175, 1178 (CD Cal. 2005) (Buono III) . In Buono\nIII , the court did not consider whether the transfer itself\nwas an “independent violation of the Establishment Clause.” Id., at 1182, n. 8. The court nevertheless concluded\nthat the transfer was an attempt by the Government to keep the\ncross atop Sunrise Rock and so was invalid. The court granted\nBuono’s motion to enforce the 2002 injunction; denied as moot his\nmotion to amend it; and permanently enjoined the Government from\nimplementing the land-transfer statute. Id., at 1182. The Court of Appeals again\naffirmed, largely following the reasoning of the District Court. Buono v. Kempthorne , 502 F. 3d 1069 (CA9\n2007). The Government’s motion for rehearing en banc was denied\nover a dissent by Judge O’Scannlain, 527 F. 3d 758, and this\nCourt granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009). II Before considering the District\nCourt’s order on the merits, the first inquiry must be with respect\nto Buono’s standing to maintain this action. To demonstrate\nstanding, a plaintiff must have “alleged such a personal stake in\nthe outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.” Horne v. Flores , 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Government argues that\nBuono’s asserted injury is not personal to him and so does not\nconfer Article III standing. As noted above, Buono does not find\nthe cross itself objectionable but instead takes offense at the\npresence of a religious symbol on federal land. Buono does not\nclaim that, as a personal matter, he has been made to feel excluded\nor coerced, and so, the Government contends, he cannot object to\nthe presence of the cross. Brief for Petitioners 12–17. Whatever the validity of the\nobjection to Buono’s standing, that argument is not available to\nthe Government at this stage of the litigation. When Buono moved\nthe District Court in Buono I for an injunction requiring\nthe removal of the cross, the Government raised the same standing\nobjections it proffers now. Rejecting the Government’s position,\nthe District Court entered a judgment in Buono’s favor, which the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed in Buono II . The Government did\nnot seek review in this Court. The judgment became final and\nunreviewable upon the expiration of the 90-day deadline under 28 U.\nS. C. §2101(c) for filing a petition for certiorari. Toledo Scale Co. v. Computing Scale Co. , 261 U. S. 399 , 418\n(1923); see Missouri v. Jenkins , 495 U. S. 33 , 45 (1990)\n(90-day deadline is “mandatory and jurisdictional”). The Government\ncannot now contest Buono’s standing to obtain the final judgment in Buono I . Of course, even though the Court may not\nreconsider whether Buono had standing to seek the 2002 injunction,\nit is still necessary to evaluate his standing in Buono\nIII to seek application of the injunction against the\nland-transfer statute. That measure of relief is embodied in the\njudgment upon which we granted review. This was a measure of relief that Buono had\nstanding to seek. A party that obtains a judgment in its favor\nacquires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring compliance\nwith that judgment. See Allen v. Wright , 468 U. S. 737 , 763\n(1984) (plaintiffs’ right to enforce a desegregation decree to\nwhich they were parties is “a personal interest, created by law, in\nhaving the State refrain from taking specific actions”). Having\nobtained a final judgment granting relief on his claims, Buono had\nstanding to seek its vindication. The Government does not deny this proposition\nas a general matter. Instead, it argues that Buono was not seeking\nto vindicate—but rather to extend—the 2002 injunction. The first\ninjunction forbade the Government from maintaining the cross on\nSunrise Rock; yet in Buono III he sought to preclude the\nland transfer, a different governmental action. The Government\ncontends that Buono lacked standing to seek this additional relief.\nReply Brief for Petitioners 5. The Government’s argument, however, is\nproperly addressed to the relief granted by the judgment below, not\nto Buono’s standing to seek that relief. The Government has\nchallenged whether appropriate relief was granted in Buono\nIII in light of the relevant considerations and legal\nprinciples, and we shall consider these questions. The standing\ninquiry, by contrast, turns on the alleged injury that prompted the\nplaintiff to invoke the court’s jurisdiction in the first place.\nBuono’s entitlement to an injunction having been established in Buono I and II , he sought in Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating or evading that\ninjunction. Based on the rights he obtained under the earlier\ndecree—against the same party, regarding the same cross and the\nsame land—his interests in doing so were sufficiently personal and\nconcrete to support his standing. Although Buono also argued that\nthe land transfer should be prohibited as an “independent”\nEstablishment Clause violation, the District Court did not address\nor order relief on that claim, which is not before us. Buono\nIII, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182, n. 8. This is not a\ncase in which a party seeks to import a previous standing\ndetermination into a wholly different dispute. In arguing that Buono sought to extend, rather\nthan to enforce, the 2002 injunction, the Government in essence\ncontends that the injunction did not provide a basis for the\nDistrict Court to invalidate the land transfer. This is not an\nargument about standing but about the merits of the District\nCourt’s order. Those points now must be addressed. III The procedural history of this\nlitigation must be considered to identify the issues now subject to\nreview. The District Court granted the 2002 injunction after\nconcluding that a cross on federal land violated the Establishment\nClause. The Government unsuccessfully challenged that conclusion on\nappeal, and the judgment became final upon completion of direct\nreview. At that point, the judgment “became res judicata to the\nparties and those in privity with them, not only as to every matter\nwhich was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or\ndemand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been\noffered for that purpose.” Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Bailey , 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 14)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Government therefore does\nnot—and could not—ask this Court to reconsider the propriety of the\n2002 injunction or the District Court’s reasons for granting\nit. The question now before the Court\nis whether the District Court properly enjoined the Government from\nimplementing the land-transfer statute. The District Court did not\nconsider whether the statute, in isolation, would have violated the\nEstablishment Clause, and it did not forbid the land transfer as an\nindependent constitutional violation. Buono III , supra , at 1182, n. 8. Rather, the court enjoined\ncompliance with the statute on the premise that the relief was\nnecessary to protect the rights Buono had secured through the 2002\ninjunction. An injunction is an exercise of a court’s\nequitable authority, to be ordered only after taking into account\nall of the circumstances that bear on the need for prospective\nrelief. See United States v. Swift & Co. , 286 U. S. 106 ,\n114 (1932). See also Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo , 456 U. S. 305 , 312\n(1982); Hecht Co. v. Bowles , 321 U. S. 321 , 329\n(1944); 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice\nand Procedure §2942, pp. 39–42 (2d ed. 1995) (hereinafter\nWright & Miller). Equitable relief is not granted as a matter\nof course, see Weinberger , 456 U. S., at 311–312, and a\ncourt should be particularly cautious when contemplating relief\nthat implicates public interests, see id., at 312 (“In\nexercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay\nparticular regard for the public consequences in employing the\nextraordinary remedy of injunction”); Harrisonville v. W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co. , 289 U. S. 334 , 338\n(1933) (“Where an important public interest would be prejudiced,\nthe reasons for denying the injunction may be compelling”). Because\ninjunctive relief “is drafted in light of what the court believes\nwill be the future course of events, … a court must never ignore\nsignificant changes in the law or circumstances underlying an\ninjunction lest the decree be turned into an ‘instrument of\nwrong.’ ” Wright & Miller §2961, at 393–394 (quoting Swift & Co. , supra , at 115). Here, the District Court did not engage in the\nappropriate inquiry. The land-transfer statute was a substantial\nchange in circumstances bearing on the propriety of the requested\nrelief. The court, however, did not acknowledge the statute’s\nsignificance. It examined the events that led to the statute’s\nenactment and found an intent to prevent removal of the cross.\nDeeming this intent illegitimate, the court concluded that nothing\nof moment had changed. This was error. Even assuming that the\nland-transfer statute was an attempt to prevent removal of the\ncross, it does not follow that an injunction against its\nimplementation was appropriate. By dismissing Congress’s motives as illicit,\nthe District Court took insufficient account of the context in\nwhich the statute was enacted and the reasons for its passage.\nPrivate citizens put the cross on Sunrise Rock to commemorate\nAmerican servicemen who had died in World War I. Although certainly\na Christian symbol, the cross was not emplaced on Sunrise Rock to\npromote a Christian message. Cf. County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh\nChapter , 492 U.\nS. 573 , 661 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part) (“[T]he [Establishment] Clause forbids a\ncity to permit the permanent erection of a large Latin cross on the\nroof of city hall … because such an obtrusive year-round religious\ndisplay would place the government’s weight behind an obvious\neffort to proselytize on behalf of a particular religion”).\nPlacement of the cross on Government-owned land was not an attempt\nto set the imprimatur of the state on a particular creed.\nRather, those who erected the cross intended simply to honor our\nNation’s fallen soldiers. See Brief for Veterans of Foreign Wars of\nthe United States et al. as Amici Curiae 15 (noting\nthat the plaque accompanying the cross “was decorated with VFW\ndecals”). Time also has played its role. The cross had\nstood on Sunrise Rock for nearly seven decades before the statute\nwas enacted. By then, the cross and the cause it commemorated had\nbecome entwined in the public consciousness. See ibid. Members of the public gathered regularly at Sunrise Rock to pay\ntheir respects. Rather than let the cross deteriorate, community\nmembers repeatedly took it upon themselves to replace it. Congress\nultimately designated the cross as a national memorial, ranking it\namong those monuments honoring the noble sacrifices that constitute\nour national heritage. See note following 16 U. S. C. §431\n(listing officially designated national memorials, including the\nNational D-Day Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial).\nResearch d",

BUONO certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the ninth circuit No. 08–472. Argued October 7, 2009—Decided April\n28, 2010 In 1934, members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars\n(VFW) placed a Latin cross on federal land in the Mojave National\nPreserve (Preserve) to honor American soldiers who died in World\nWar I. Claiming to be offended by a religious symbol’s presence on\nfederal land, respondent Buono, a regular visitor to the Preserve,\nfiled this suit alleging a violation of the First Amendment’s\nEstablishment Clause and seeking an injunction requiring the\nGovernment to remove the cross. In the litigation’s first stage (Buono I) , the District Court found that Buono had\nstanding to sue and, concluding that the presence of the cross on\nfederal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of\nreligion, see Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U. S. 602 , 612–613,\nit granted Buono’s requested injunctive relief (2002 injunction).\nThe District Court did not consider whether the Government’s\nactions regarding the cross had a secular purpose or caused\nentanglement with religion. While the Government’s appeal was\npending, Congress passed the Department of Defense Appropriations\nAct, 2004, §8121(a) of which directed the Secretary of the Interior\nto transfer the cross and the land on which it stands to the VFW in\nexchange for privately owned land elsewhere in the Preserve\n(land-transfer statute). Affirming the District Court’s judgment\nboth as to standing and on the merits, the Ninth Circuit declined\nto address the statute’s effect on Buono’s suit or the statute’s\nconstitutionality (Buono II). Because the Government did\nnot seek review by this Court, the Court of Appeals’ judgment\nbecame final. Buono then returned to the District Court seeking\ninjunctive relief against the land transfer, either through\nenforcement or modification of the 2002 injunction. In 2005, that\ncourt rejected the Government’s claim that the transfer was a bona\nfide attempt to comply with the injunction, concluding, instead,\nthat it was actually an invalid attempt to keep the cross on\ndisplay. The court granted Buono’s motion to enforce the 2002\ninjunction; denied as moot his motion to amend it; and permanently\nenjoined the Government from implementing the land-transfer statute (Buono III). The Ninth Circuit again affirmed, largely\nfollowing the District Court’s reasoning . Held: The judgment is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded. 502 F. 3d 1069 and 527 F. 3d 758,\nreversed and remanded. Justice Kennedy, joined in full\nby The Chief Justice and in part by Justice Alito, concluded: 1. Buono has standing to maintain this\naction. Whatever the validity of the Government’s argument that\nBuono’s asserted injury—offense at a religious symbol’s presence on\nfederal land—is not personal to him and so does not confer Article\nIII standing, that argument is not available at this stage of the\nlitigation. The District Court rejected the argument in Buono\nI, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in Buono II, and the\nCourt of Appeals’ judgment became final and unreviewable upon the\nexpiration of the 90-day deadline for filing a certiorari petition,\n28 U. S. C. §2101(c). Moreover, Buono had standing in Buono III to seek application of the injunction against\nthe land-transfer statute. A party that obtains a judgment in its\nfavor acquires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring\ncompliance with that judgment. See Allen v. Wright , 468\nU. S. 737 . Buono’s entitlement to an injunction having been\nestablished in Buono I and II , he sought in Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating or\nevading that injunction. His interests in doing so were\nsufficiently personal and concrete to support his standing, given\nthe rights he obtained under the earlier decree against the same\nparty as to the same cross and the same land. The Government’s\ncontention that Buono sought to extend, rather than to enforce, the\n2002 injunction is not an argument about standing, but about the\nmerits of the District Court’s order. Pp. 7–9. 2. The District Court erred in enjoining\nthe Government from implementing the land-transfer statute on the\npremise that the relief was necessary to protect Buono’s rights\nunder the 2002 injunction. Pp. 9–18. (a) A court may order\nan injunction only after taking into account all the circumstances\nbearing on the need for prospective relief. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Swift & Co. , 286 U. S. 106 , 114.\nHere, the District Court did not engage in the appropriate inquiry.\nThe land-transfer statute was a substantial change in circumstances\nbearing on the propriety of the requested relief. By dismissing as\nillicit the motives of Congress in passing it, the District Court\ntook insufficient account of the context in which the statute was\nenacted and the reasons for its passage. Placement of the cross on\nfederal land by private persons was not an attempt to set the\nstate’s imprimatur on a particular creed. Rather, the\nintent was simply to honor fallen soldiers. Moreover, the cross\nstood for nearly seven decades before the statute was enacted, by\nwhich time the cross and the cause it commemorated had become\nentwined in the public consciousness. The 2002 injunction thus\npresented the Government with a dilemma. It could not maintain the\ncross without violating the injunction, but it could not remove the\ncross without conveying disrespect for those the cross was seen as\nhonoring. Deeming neither alternative satisfactory, Congress\nenacted the land-transfer statute. The statute embodied a\nlegislative judgment that this dispute is best resolved through a\nframework and policy of accommodation. The statute should not have\nbeen dismissed as an evasion, for it brought about a change of law\nand a congressional statement of policy applicable to the case.\nPp. 9–13. (b) Where legislative\naction undermines the basis for previous relief, the relevant\nquestion is whether an ongoing exercise of the court’s equitable\nauthority is supported by the prior showing of illegality, judged\nagainst the claim that changed circumstances render prospective\nrelief inappropriate. The District Court granted the 2002\ninjunction based solely on its conclusion that the presence of the\ncross on federal land conveyed an impression of governmental\nendorsement of religion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed on the same\ngrounds. Neither court considered whether the Government had acted\nbased on an improper purpose. Given this sole reliance on\nperception, any further relief grounded on the injunction should\nhave rested on the same basis. But the District Court used an\ninjunction granted for one reason (perceived governmental\nendorsement) as the basis for enjoining conduct that was alleged to\nbe objectionable for a different reason (an illicit governmental\npurpose). Ordering relief under such circumstances was improper.\nThe court failed to consider whether the change in law and\ncircumstances effected by the land-transfer statute had rendered\nthe “reasonable observer” standard inappropriate to resolve the\ndispute. Nor did the court attempt to reassess Buono I ’s\nfindings in light of the accommodation policy embraced by Congress.\nRather, it concentrated solely on the religious aspects of the\ncross, divorced from its background and context.\nPp. 13–17. (c) The same respect\nfor a coordinate branch of Government that forbids striking down an\nAct of Congress except upon a clear showing of unconstitutionality,\nsee, e.g., United States v. Morrison , 529 U. S. 598 , 607,\nrequires that a congressional command be given effect unless no\nlegal alternative exists. Even if, contrary to the congressional\njudgment, the land transfer were thought an insufficient\naccommodation in light of the earlier endorsement finding, it was\nincumbent upon the District Court to consider less drastic relief\nthan complete invalidation of the statute. See, e.g.,\nAyotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng. , 546 U. S. 320 ,\n329. On remand, that court should conduct a proper inquiry into the\ncontinued necessity for injunctive relief in light of the statute.\nPp. 17–18. Justice Alito concluded that this case should\nnot be remanded for the lower courts to decide whether\nimplementation of the land-transfer statute would violate the\nDistrict Court’s injunction or the Establishment Clause. Rather,\nbecause the factual record has been sufficiently developed to\npermit resolution of these questions, he would decide them and hold\nthat the statute may be implemented. The case’s singular\ncircumstances presented Congress with a delicate problem. Its\nsolution was an approach designed to eliminate any perception of\nreligious sponsorship stemming from the location of the cross on\nfederally owned land, while avoiding the disturbing symbolism that\nsome would associate with the destruction of this historic\nmonument. The mechanism Congress selected is quite common in the\nWest, a “land exchange,” whereby ownership of the land on which the\ncross is located would be transferred to the VFW in exchange for\nanother nearby parcel of equal value. The land transfer would not\nviolate the District Court injunction, the obvious meaning of which\nwas simply that the Government could not allow the cross to remain\non federal land. Nor would the statute’s implementation\nconstitute an endorsement of religion in violation of the\nEstablishment Clause. The so-called “endorsement test” views a\nchallenged religious display through the eyes of a hypothetical\nreasonable observer aware of the history and all other pertinent\nfacts relating to the display. Here, therefore, this observer would\nbe familiar with the monument’s origin and history and thereby\nappreciate that the transfer represents an effort by Congress to\naddress a unique situation and to find a solution that best\naccommodates conflicting concerns. Finally, the statute was not\nenacted for the illicit purpose of embracing the monument’s\nreligious message but to commemorate the Nation’s war dead and to\navoid the disturbing symbolism that would have been created by the\nmonument’s destruction. Pp. 1–7. Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas,\nconcluded that this Court need not—indeed, cannot —decide\nthis case’s merits because Buono lacks Article III standing to\npursue the relief he seeks, which is not enforcement of the\noriginal injunction but expansion of it. By enjoining the\nGovernment from implementing the statute at issue, the District\nCourt’s 2005 order went well beyond the original injunction’s\nproscription of the cross’s display on public property. Because\nBuono seeks new relief, he must show that he has standing to pursue\nthat relief by demonstrating that blocking the land transfer will\n“redress or prevent an actual or imminently threatened injury to\n[him] caused by private or official violation of law.” Summers v. Earth Island Institute , 555 U. S. ___,\n___. He has failed, however, to allege any such injury. Even\nassuming that being offended by a religious display constitutes a\ncognizable injury, it is merely speculative whether the cross will\nremain in place, and in any event Buono has made clear, by\nadmitting he has no objection to Christian symbols on private\nproperty, that he will not be offended. Neither district\ncourts’ discretion to expand injunctions they have issued nor this\nDistrict Court’s characterization of its 2005 order as merely\nenforcing the existing injunction makes any difference. If in fact\na court awards new relief, it must have Article III jurisdiction to\ndo so. Pp. 1–7.

S. ____ (2010) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 08-472 KEN L. SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR,\net al., PETITIONERS v. FRANK BUONO on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit [April 28, 2010] Justice Kennedy announced the\njudgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief\nJustice joins and Justice Alito joins in part. In 1934, private citizens placed\na Latin cross on a rock outcropping in a remote section of the\nMojave Desert. Their purpose and intent was to honor American\nsoldiers who fell in World War I. The original cross deteriorated\nover time, but a reconstructed one now stands at the same place. It\nis on federal land. The Court is asked to consider a challenge,\nnot to the first placement of the cross or its continued presence\non federal land, but to a statute that would transfer the cross and\nthe land on which it stands to a private party. Department of\nDefense Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108–87, §8121(a), 117\nStat. 1100. The District Court permanently enjoined the Government\nfrom implementing the statute. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We\nconclude that its judgment was in error. I A The Mojave National Preserve\n(Preserve) spans approximately 1.6 million acres in southeastern\nCalifornia. The Preserve is nestled within the Mojave Desert, whose\npicturesque but rugged territory comprises 25,000 square miles,\nexceeding in size the combined area of the Nation’s five smallest\nStates. See Merriam-Webster’s Geographical Dictionary 755,\n1228–1230 (3d ed. 1997). Just over 90 percent of the land in the\nPreserve is federally owned, with the rest owned either by the\nState of California or by private parties. The National Park\nService, a division of the Department of the Interior, administers\nthe Preserve as part of the National Park System. 16 U. S. C.\n§§410aaa–41 and 410aaa–46. Sunrise Rock is a granite\noutcropping located within the Preserve. Sunrise Rock and the area\nin its immediate vicinity are federal land, but two private ranches\nare located less than two miles away. The record does not indicate\nwhether fencing is used to mark the boundary of these ranches. In\n1934, members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) mounted a Latin\ncross on the rock as a memorial to soldiers who died in World War\nI. A Latin cross consists of two bars—a vertical one and a shorter,\nhorizontal one. The cross has been replaced or repaired at various\ntimes over the years, most recently in 1998 by Henry Sandoz. Sandoz\nis a private citizen who owns land elsewhere in the Preserve, a\nportion of which he is prepared to transfer to the Government in\nreturn for its conveyance to the VFW of the land on which the cross\nstands, all pursuant to the statute now under review. The cross, as built by Sandoz, consists of\n4-inch diameter metal pipes painted white. The vertical bar is less\nthan eight feet tall. It cannot be seen from the nearest highway,\nwhich lies more than 10 miles away. It is visible, however, from\nCima Road, a narrow stretch of blacktop that comes within 100 feet\nof Sunrise Rock. The cross has been a gathering place for\nEaster services since it was first put in place; and Sunrise Rock\nand its immediate area continue to be used as a campsite. At one\ntime the cross was accompanied by wooden signs stating “ ‘The\nCross, Erected in Memory of the Dead of All Wars,’ and ‘Erected\n1934 by Members of Veterans of Foregin [sic] Wars, Death Valley\npost 2884.’ ” Buono v. Kempthorne , 527\nF. 3d 758, 769 (CA9 2008). The signs have since disappeared,\nand the cross now stands unmarked. B Frank Buono, respondent here, is\na retired Park Service employee who makes regular visits to the\nPreserve. Buono claims to be offended by the presence of a\nreligious symbol on federal land. He filed suit in the United\nStates District Court for the Central District of California. He\nalleged a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First\nAmendment and sought an injunction requiring the Government to\nremove the cross. The litigation proceeded in what\ncan be described as four stages. In the first, the District Court\nruled in Buono’s favor on opposing motions for summary judgment. Buono v. Norton , 212 F. Supp. 2d 1202 (CD\nCal. 2002) (Buono I) . As an initial matter, the court\nfound that Buono had standing to maintain his Establishment Clause\nchallenge. Id., at 1210–1214. On the merits, the parties\nagreed that the dispute should be governed by the so-called Lemon test, which the District Court formulated as\nfollows: “A government religious practice or symbol will\nsurvive an Establishment Clause challenge when it (1) has a\nsecular purpose, (2) has a primary effect that neither advances nor\ninhibits religion, and (3) does not foster excessive state\nentanglement with religion.” Buono I , supra , at\n1214–1215 (citing Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U. S. 602 , 612–613\n(1971)). The court expressly declined to consider whether\nthe Government’s actions regarding the cross had a secular purpose,\n212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1214–1215, or whether they caused\nexcessive entanglement with religion, id., at 1217,\nn. 9. Instead, the court evaluated the primary effect of the\ncross by asking how it would be viewed by a “reasonable observer.” Id., at 1216. Concluding that presence of the cross on\nfederal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of\nreligion, the court granted Buono’s request for injunctive relief.\nThe court’s order in Buono I (2002 injunction) permanently\nforbade the Government “from permitting the display of the Latin\ncross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 146a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit stayed the 2002 injunction to the extent that it\nrequired the cross to be removed or dismantled but did not forbid\nalternative methods of complying with the order. The Government\ncovered the cross, first with a tarpaulin and later with a plywood\nbox. On appeal, the judgment of the District Court\nwas affirmed, both as to standing and on the merits of Buono’s\nEstablishment Clause challenge. Buono v. Norton ,\n371 F. 3d 543 (CA9 2004) (Buono II) . Like the\nDistrict Court, the Court of Appeals did not decide whether the\nGovernment’s action, or nonaction, with respect to the cross had\nbeen motivated by a secular purpose. Id., at 550. Its\nruling was based instead on the conclusion that a reasonable\nobserver would perceive a cross on federal land as governmental\nendorsement of religion. Id., at 549–550. The Government\ndid not seek review by this Court, so that the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals in Buono II became final. C During the relevant proceedings,\nCongress enacted certain statutes related to the cross: (1) Before Buono I was\nfiled, Congress passed an appropriations bill that included a\nprovision forbidding the use of governmental funds to remove the\ncross. Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. 106–554,\n§133, 114 Stat. 2763A–230. (2) While Buono I was pending before\nthe District Court, Congress designated the cross and its adjoining\nland “as a national memorial commemorating United States\nparticipation in World War I and honoring the American veterans of\nthat war.” Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2002, Pub. L.\n107–117, §8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278. The Secretary of the Interior\nwas directed to expend up to $10,000 to acquire a replica of the\noriginal cross and its memorial plaque and to install the plaque at\na suitable nearby location. §8137(c). (3) Three months after Buono I was\ndecided, Congress again prohibited the spending of governmental\nfunds to remove the cross. Department of Defense Appropriations\nAct, 2003, Pub. L. 107–248, §8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551. (4) While the Government’s appeal in Buono\nII was pending, Congress passed a statute (land-transfer\nstatute) directing the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the\nVFW the Government’s interest in the land that had been designated\na national memorial. Department of Defense Appropriations Act,\n2004, Pub. L. 108–87, §8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100. In exchange, the\nGovernment was to receive land elsewhere in the preserve from Henry\nSandoz and his wife. Ibid. Any difference in value between\nthe two parcels would be equalized through a cash payment.\n§§8121(c), (d). The land-transfer statute provided that the\nproperty would revert to the Government if not maintained “as a\nmemorial commemorating United States participation in World War I\nand honoring the American veterans of that war.” §8121(e), 117\nStat. 1100. The statute presents a central issue in this case. The Court of Appeals in Buono II did\nnot address the effect on the suit of a potential land transfer\nunder the statute. The court noted that the transfer might “take as\nlong as two years to complete,” 371 F. 3d, at 545, and that\nits effect was not yet known, id., at 545–546. The court\nthus “express[ed] no view as to whether a transfer completed under\n[the statute] would pass constitutional muster.” Id., at\n546. D After the Court of Appeals\naffirmed in Buono II , Buono returned to the District Court\nseeking to prevent the land transfer. He sought injunctive relief\nagainst the transfer, either through enforcement or modification of\nthe 2002 injunction. In evaluating his request the trial court\ndescribed the relevant question as whether the land transfer was a\nbona fide attempt to comply with the injunction (as the Government\nclaimed), or a sham aimed at keeping the cross in place (as Buono\nclaimed). Buono v. Norton , 364 F. Supp. 2d\n1175, 1178 (CD Cal. 2005) (Buono III) . In Buono\nIII , the court did not consider whether the transfer itself\nwas an “independent violation of the Establishment Clause.” Id., at 1182, n. 8. The court nevertheless concluded\nthat the transfer was an attempt by the Government to keep the\ncross atop Sunrise Rock and so was invalid. The court granted\nBuono’s motion to enforce the 2002 injunction; denied as moot his\nmotion to amend it; and permanently enjoined the Government from\nimplementing the land-transfer statute. Id., at 1182. The Court of Appeals again\naffirmed, largely following the reasoning of the District Court. Buono v. Kempthorne , 502 F. 3d 1069 (CA9\n2007). The Government’s motion for rehearing en banc was denied\nover a dissent by Judge O’Scannlain, 527 F. 3d 758, and this\nCourt granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009). II Before considering the District\nCourt’s order on the merits, the first inquiry must be with respect\nto Buono’s standing to maintain this action. To demonstrate\nstanding, a plaintiff must have “alleged such a personal stake in\nthe outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.” Horne v. Flores , 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Government argues that\nBuono’s asserted injury is not personal to him and so does not\nconfer Article III standing. As noted above, Buono does not find\nthe cross itself objectionable but instead takes offense at the\npresence of a religious symbol on federal land. Buono does not\nclaim that, as a personal matter, he has been made to feel excluded\nor coerced, and so, the Government contends, he cannot object to\nthe presence of the cross. Brief for Petitioners 12–17. Whatever the validity of the\nobjection to Buono’s standing, that argument is not available to\nthe Government at this stage of the litigation. When Buono moved\nthe District Court in Buono I for an injunction requiring\nthe removal of the cross, the Government raised the same standing\nobjections it proffers now. Rejecting the Government’s position,\nthe District Court entered a judgment in Buono’s favor, which the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed in Buono II . The Government did\nnot seek review in this Court. The judgment became final and\nunreviewable upon the expiration of the 90-day deadline under 28 U.\nS. C. §2101(c) for filing a petition for certiorari. Toledo Scale Co. v. Computing Scale Co. , 261 U. S. 399 , 418\n(1923); see Missouri v. Jenkins , 495 U. S. 33 , 45 (1990)\n(90-day deadline is “mandatory and jurisdictional”). The Government\ncannot now contest Buono’s standing to obtain the final judgment in Buono I . Of course, even though the Court may not\nreconsider whether Buono had standing to seek the 2002 injunction,\nit is still necessary to evaluate his standing in Buono\nIII to seek application of the injunction against the\nland-transfer statute. That measure of relief is embodied in the\njudgment upon which we granted review. This was a measure of relief that Buono had\nstanding to seek. A party that obtains a judgment in its favor\nacquires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring compliance\nwith that judgment. See Allen v. Wright , 468 U. S. 737 , 763\n(1984) (plaintiffs’ right to enforce a desegregation decree to\nwhich they were parties is “a personal interest, created by law, in\nhaving the State refrain from taking specific actions”). Having\nobtained a final judgment granting relief on his claims, Buono had\nstanding to seek its vindication. The Government does not deny this proposition\nas a general matter. Instead, it argues that Buono was not seeking\nto vindicate—but rather to extend—the 2002 injunction. The first\ninjunction forbade the Government from maintaining the cross on\nSunrise Rock; yet in Buono III he sought to preclude the\nland transfer, a different governmental action. The Government\ncontends that Buono lacked standing to seek this additional relief.\nReply Brief for Petitioners 5. The Government’s argument, however, is\nproperly addressed to the relief granted by the judgment below, not\nto Buono’s standing to seek that relief. The Government has\nchallenged whether appropriate relief was granted in Buono\nIII in light of the relevant considerations and legal\nprinciples, and we shall consider these questions. The standing\ninquiry, by contrast, turns on the alleged injury that prompted the\nplaintiff to invoke the court’s jurisdiction in the first place.\nBuono’s entitlement to an injunction having been established in Buono I and II , he sought in Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating or evading that\ninjunction. Based on the rights he obtained under the earlier\ndecree—against the same party, regarding the same cross and the\nsame land—his interests in doing so were sufficiently personal and\nconcrete to support his standing. Although Buono also argued that\nthe land transfer should be prohibited as an “independent”\nEstablishment Clause violation, the District Court did not address\nor order relief on that claim, which is not before us. Buono\nIII, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182, n. 8. This is not a\ncase in which a party seeks to import a previous standing\ndetermination into a wholly different dispute. In arguing that Buono sought to extend, rather\nthan to enforce, the 2002 injunction, the Government in essence\ncontends that the injunction did not provide a basis for the\nDistrict Court to invalidate the land transfer. This is not an\nargument about standing but about the merits of the District\nCourt’s order. Those points now must be addressed. III The procedural history of this\nlitigation must be considered to identify the issues now subject to\nreview. The District Court granted the 2002 injunction after\nconcluding that a cross on federal land violated the Establishment\nClause. The Government unsuccessfully challenged that conclusion on\nappeal, and the judgment became final upon completion of direct\nreview. At that point, the judgment “became res judicata to the\nparties and those in privity with them, not only as to every matter\nwhich was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or\ndemand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been\noffered for that purpose.” Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Bailey , 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 14)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Government therefore does\nnot—and could not—ask this Court to reconsider the propriety of the\n2002 injunction or the District Court’s reasons for granting\nit. The question now before the Court\nis whether the District Court properly enjoined the Government from\nimplementing the land-transfer statute. The District Court did not\nconsider whether the statute, in isolation, would have violated the\nEstablishment Clause, and it did not forbid the land transfer as an\nindependent constitutional violation. Buono III , supra , at 1182, n. 8. Rather, the court enjoined\ncompliance with the statute on the premise that the relief was\nnecessary to protect the rights Buono had secured through the 2002\ninjunction. An injunction is an exercise of a court’s\nequitable authority, to be ordered only after taking into account\nall of the circumstances that bear on the need for prospective\nrelief. See United States v. Swift & Co. , 286 U. S. 106 ,\n114 (1932). See also Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo , 456 U. S. 305 , 312\n(1982); Hecht Co. v. Bowles , 321 U. S. 321 , 329\n(1944); 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice\nand Procedure §2942, pp. 39–42 (2d ed. 1995) (hereinafter\nWright & Miller). Equitable relief is not granted as a matter\nof course, see Weinberger , 456 U. S., at 311–312, and a\ncourt should be particularly cautious when contemplating relief\nthat implicates public interests, see id., at 312 (“In\nexercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay\nparticular regard for the public consequences in employing the\nextraordinary remedy of injunction”); Harrisonville v. W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co. , 289 U. S. 334 , 338\n(1933) (“Where an important public interest would be prejudiced,\nthe reasons for denying the injunction may be compelling”). Because\ninjunctive relief “is drafted in light of what the court believes\nwill be the future course of events, … a court must never ignore\nsignificant changes in the law or circumstances underlying an\ninjunction lest the decree be turned into an ‘instrument of\nwrong.’ ” Wright & Miller §2961, at 393–394 (quoting Swift & Co. , supra , at 115). Here, the District Court did not engage in the\nappropriate inquiry. The land-transfer statute was a substantial\nchange in circumstances bearing on the propriety of the requested\nrelief. The court, however, did not acknowledge the statute’s\nsignificance. It examined the events that led to the statute’s\nenactment and found an intent to prevent removal of the cross.\nDeeming this intent illegitimate, the court concluded that nothing\nof moment had changed. This was error. Even assuming that the\nland-transfer statute was an attempt to prevent removal of the\ncross, it does not follow that an injunction against its\nimplementation was appropriate. By dismissing Congress’s motives as illicit,\nthe District Court took insufficient account of the context in\nwhich the statute was enacted and the reasons for its passage.\nPrivate citizens put the cross on Sunrise Rock to commemorate\nAmerican servicemen who had died in World War I. Although certainly\na Christian symbol, the cross was not emplaced on Sunrise Rock to\npromote a Christian message. Cf. County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh\nChapter , 492 U.\nS. 573 , 661 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part) (“[T]he [Establishment] Clause forbids a\ncity to permit the permanent erection of a large Latin cross on the\nroof of city hall … because such an obtrusive year-round religious\ndisplay would place the government’s weight behind an obvious\neffort to proselytize on behalf of a particular religion”).\nPlacement of the cross on Government-owned land was not an attempt\nto set the imprimatur of the state on a particular creed.\nRather, those who erected the cross intended simply to honor our\nNation’s fallen soldiers. See Brief for Veterans of Foreign Wars of\nthe United States et al. as Amici Curiae 15 (noting\nthat the plaque accompanying the cross “was decorated with VFW\ndecals”). Time also has played its role. The cross had\nstood on Sunrise Rock for nearly seven decades before the statute\nwas enacted. By then, the cross and the cause it commemorated had\nbecome entwined in the public consciousness. See ibid. Members of the public gathered regularly at Sunrise Rock to pay\ntheir respects. Rather than let the cross deteriorate, community\nmembers repeatedly took it upon themselves to replace it. Congress\nultimately designated the cross as a national memorial, ranking it\namong those monuments honoring the noble sacrifices that constitute\nour national heritage. See note following 16 U. S. C. §431\n(listing officially designated national memorials, including the\nNational D-Day Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial).\nResearch d",

BUONO certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the ninth circuit No. 08–472. Argued October 7, 2009—Decided April\n28, 2010 In 1934, members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars\n(VFW) placed a Latin cross on federal land in the Mojave National\nPreserve (Preserve) to honor American soldiers who died in World\nWar I. Claiming to be offended by a religious symbol’s presence on\nfederal land, respondent Buono, a regular visitor to the Preserve,\nfiled this suit alleging a violation of the First Amendment’s\nEstablishment Clause and seeking an injunction requiring the\nGovernment to remove the cross. In the litigation’s first stage (Buono I) , the District Court found that Buono had\nstanding to sue and, concluding that the presence of the cross on\nfederal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of\nreligion, see Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U. S. 602 , 612–613,\nit granted Buono’s requested injunctive relief (2002 injunction).\nThe District Court did not consider whether the Government’s\nactions regarding the cross had a secular purpose or caused\nentanglement with religion. While the Government’s appeal was\npending, Congress passed the Department of Defense Appropriations\nAct, 2004, §8121(a) of which directed the Secretary of the Interior\nto transfer the cross and the land on which it stands to the VFW in\nexchange for privately owned land elsewhere in the Preserve\n(land-transfer statute). Affirming the District Court’s judgment\nboth as to standing and on the merits, the Ninth Circuit declined\nto address the statute’s effect on Buono’s suit or the statute’s\nconstitutionality (Buono II). Because the Government did\nnot seek review by this Court, the Court of Appeals’ judgment\nbecame final. Buono then returned to the District Court seeking\ninjunctive relief against the land transfer, either through\nenforcement or modification of the 2002 injunction. In 2005, that\ncourt rejected the Government’s claim that the transfer was a bona\nfide attempt to comply with the injunction, concluding, instead,\nthat it was actually an invalid attempt to keep the cross on\ndisplay. The court granted Buono’s motion to enforce the 2002\ninjunction; denied as moot his motion to amend it; and permanently\nenjoined the Government from implementing the land-transfer statute (Buono III). The Ninth Circuit again affirmed, largely\nfollowing the District Court’s reasoning . Held: The judgment is reversed, and\nthe case is remanded. 502 F. 3d 1069 and 527 F. 3d 758,\nreversed and remanded. Justice Kennedy, joined in full\nby The Chief Justice and in part by Justice Alito, concluded: 1. Buono has standing to maintain this\naction. Whatever the validity of the Government’s argument that\nBuono’s asserted injury—offense at a religious symbol’s presence on\nfederal land—is not personal to him and so does not confer Article\nIII standing, that argument is not available at this stage of the\nlitigation. The District Court rejected the argument in Buono\nI, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in Buono II, and the\nCourt of Appeals’ judgment became final and unreviewable upon the\nexpiration of the 90-day deadline for filing a certiorari petition,\n28 U. S. C. §2101(c). Moreover, Buono had standing in Buono III to seek application of the injunction against\nthe land-transfer statute. A party that obtains a judgment in its\nfavor acquires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring\ncompliance with that judgment. See Allen v. Wright , 468\nU. S. 737 . Buono’s entitlement to an injunction having been\nestablished in Buono I and II , he sought in Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating or\nevading that injunction. His interests in doing so were\nsufficiently personal and concrete to support his standing, given\nthe rights he obtained under the earlier decree against the same\nparty as to the same cross and the same land. The Government’s\ncontention that Buono sought to extend, rather than to enforce, the\n2002 injunction is not an argument about standing, but about the\nmerits of the District Court’s order. Pp. 7–9. 2. The District Court erred in enjoining\nthe Government from implementing the land-transfer statute on the\npremise that the relief was necessary to protect Buono’s rights\nunder the 2002 injunction. Pp. 9–18. (a) A court may order\nan injunction only after taking into account all the circumstances\nbearing on the need for prospective relief. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Swift & Co. , 286 U. S. 106 , 114.\nHere, the District Court did not engage in the appropriate inquiry.\nThe land-transfer statute was a substantial change in circumstances\nbearing on the propriety of the requested relief. By dismissing as\nillicit the motives of Congress in passing it, the District Court\ntook insufficient account of the context in which the statute was\nenacted and the reasons for its passage. Placement of the cross on\nfederal land by private persons was not an attempt to set the\nstate’s imprimatur on a particular creed. Rather, the\nintent was simply to honor fallen soldiers. Moreover, the cross\nstood for nearly seven decades before the statute was enacted, by\nwhich time the cross and the cause it commemorated had become\nentwined in the public consciousness. The 2002 injunction thus\npresented the Government with a dilemma. It could not maintain the\ncross without violating the injunction, but it could not remove the\ncross without conveying disrespect for those the cross was seen as\nhonoring. Deeming neither alternative satisfactory, Congress\nenacted the land-transfer statute. The statute embodied a\nlegislative judgment that this dispute is best resolved through a\nframework and policy of accommodation. The statute should not have\nbeen dismissed as an evasion, for it brought about a change of law\nand a congressional statement of policy applicable to the case.\nPp. 9–13. (b) Where legislative\naction undermines the basis for previous relief, the relevant\nquestion is whether an ongoing exercise of the court’s equitable\nauthority is supported by the prior showing of illegality, judged\nagainst the claim that changed circumstances render prospective\nrelief inappropriate. The District Court granted the 2002\ninjunction based solely on its conclusion that the presence of the\ncross on federal land conveyed an impression of governmental\nendorsement of religion, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed on the same\ngrounds. Neither court considered whether the Government had acted\nbased on an improper purpose. Given this sole reliance on\nperception, any further relief grounded on the injunction should\nhave rested on the same basis. But the District Court used an\ninjunction granted for one reason (perceived governmental\nendorsement) as the basis for enjoining conduct that was alleged to\nbe objectionable for a different reason (an illicit governmental\npurpose). Ordering relief under such circumstances was improper.\nThe court failed to consider whether the change in law and\ncircumstances effected by the land-transfer statute had rendered\nthe “reasonable observer” standard inappropriate to resolve the\ndispute. Nor did the court attempt to reassess Buono I ’s\nfindings in light of the accommodation policy embraced by Congress.\nRather, it concentrated solely on the religious aspects of the\ncross, divorced from its background and context.\nPp. 13–17. (c) The same respect\nfor a coordinate branch of Government that forbids striking down an\nAct of Congress except upon a clear showing of unconstitutionality,\nsee, e.g., United States v. Morrison , 529 U. S. 598 , 607,\nrequires that a congressional command be given effect unless no\nlegal alternative exists. Even if, contrary to the congressional\njudgment, the land transfer were thought an insufficient\naccommodation in light of the earlier endorsement finding, it was\nincumbent upon the District Court to consider less drastic relief\nthan complete invalidation of the statute. See, e.g.,\nAyotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng. , 546 U. S. 320 ,\n329. On remand, that court should conduct a proper inquiry into the\ncontinued necessity for injunctive relief in light of the statute.\nPp. 17–18. Justice Alito concluded that this case should\nnot be remanded for the lower courts to decide whether\nimplementation of the land-transfer statute would violate the\nDistrict Court’s injunction or the Establishment Clause. Rather,\nbecause the factual record has been sufficiently developed to\npermit resolution of these questions, he would decide them and hold\nthat the statute may be implemented. The case’s singular\ncircumstances presented Congress with a delicate problem. Its\nsolution was an approach designed to eliminate any perception of\nreligious sponsorship stemming from the location of the cross on\nfederally owned land, while avoiding the disturbing symbolism that\nsome would associate with the destruction of this historic\nmonument. The mechanism Congress selected is quite common in the\nWest, a “land exchange,” whereby ownership of the land on which the\ncross is located would be transferred to the VFW in exchange for\nanother nearby parcel of equal value. The land transfer would not\nviolate the District Court injunction, the obvious meaning of which\nwas simply that the Government could not allow the cross to remain\non federal land. Nor would the statute’s implementation\nconstitute an endorsement of religion in violation of the\nEstablishment Clause. The so-called “endorsement test” views a\nchallenged religious display through the eyes of a hypothetical\nreasonable observer aware of the history and all other pertinent\nfacts relating to the display. Here, therefore, this observer would\nbe familiar with the monument’s origin and history and thereby\nappreciate that the transfer represents an effort by Congress to\naddress a unique situation and to find a solution that best\naccommodates conflicting concerns. Finally, the statute was not\nenacted for the illicit purpose of embracing the monument’s\nreligious message but to commemorate the Nation’s war dead and to\navoid the disturbing symbolism that would have been created by the\nmonument’s destruction. Pp. 1–7. Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas,\nconcluded that this Court need not—indeed, cannot —decide\nthis case’s merits because Buono lacks Article III standing to\npursue the relief he seeks, which is not enforcement of the\noriginal injunction but expansion of it. By enjoining the\nGovernment from implementing the statute at issue, the District\nCourt’s 2005 order went well beyond the original injunction’s\nproscription of the cross’s display on public property. Because\nBuono seeks new relief, he must show that he has standing to pursue\nthat relief by demonstrating that blocking the land transfer will\n“redress or prevent an actual or imminently threatened injury to\n[him] caused by private or official violation of law.” Summers v. Earth Island Institute , 555 U. S. ___,\n___. He has failed, however, to allege any such injury. Even\nassuming that being offended by a religious display constitutes a\ncognizable injury, it is merely speculative whether the cross will\nremain in place, and in any event Buono has made clear, by\nadmitting he has no objection to Christian symbols on private\nproperty, that he will not be offended. Neither district\ncourts’ discretion to expand injunctions they have issued nor this\nDistrict Court’s characterization of its 2005 order as merely\nenforcing the existing injunction makes any difference. If in fact\na court awards new relief, it must have Article III jurisdiction to\ndo so. Pp. 1–7.

S. ____ (2010) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 08-472 KEN L. SALAZAR, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR,\net al., PETITIONERS v. FRANK BUONO on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit [April 28, 2010] Justice Kennedy announced the\njudgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief\nJustice joins and Justice Alito joins in part. In 1934, private citizens placed\na Latin cross on a rock outcropping in a remote section of the\nMojave Desert. Their purpose and intent was to honor American\nsoldiers who fell in World War I. The original cross deteriorated\nover time, but a reconstructed one now stands at the same place. It\nis on federal land. The Court is asked to consider a challenge,\nnot to the first placement of the cross or its continued presence\non federal land, but to a statute that would transfer the cross and\nthe land on which it stands to a private party. Department of\nDefense Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. 108–87, §8121(a), 117\nStat. 1100. The District Court permanently enjoined the Government\nfrom implementing the statute. The Court of Appeals affirmed. We\nconclude that its judgment was in error. I A The Mojave National Preserve\n(Preserve) spans approximately 1.6 million acres in southeastern\nCalifornia. The Preserve is nestled within the Mojave Desert, whose\npicturesque but rugged territory comprises 25,000 square miles,\nexceeding in size the combined area of the Nation’s five smallest\nStates. See Merriam-Webster’s Geographical Dictionary 755,\n1228–1230 (3d ed. 1997). Just over 90 percent of the land in the\nPreserve is federally owned, with the rest owned either by the\nState of California or by private parties. The National Park\nService, a division of the Department of the Interior, administers\nthe Preserve as part of the National Park System. 16 U. S. C.\n§§410aaa–41 and 410aaa–46. Sunrise Rock is a granite\noutcropping located within the Preserve. Sunrise Rock and the area\nin its immediate vicinity are federal land, but two private ranches\nare located less than two miles away. The record does not indicate\nwhether fencing is used to mark the boundary of these ranches. In\n1934, members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) mounted a Latin\ncross on the rock as a memorial to soldiers who died in World War\nI. A Latin cross consists of two bars—a vertical one and a shorter,\nhorizontal one. The cross has been replaced or repaired at various\ntimes over the years, most recently in 1998 by Henry Sandoz. Sandoz\nis a private citizen who owns land elsewhere in the Preserve, a\nportion of which he is prepared to transfer to the Government in\nreturn for its conveyance to the VFW of the land on which the cross\nstands, all pursuant to the statute now under review. The cross, as built by Sandoz, consists of\n4-inch diameter metal pipes painted white. The vertical bar is less\nthan eight feet tall. It cannot be seen from the nearest highway,\nwhich lies more than 10 miles away. It is visible, however, from\nCima Road, a narrow stretch of blacktop that comes within 100 feet\nof Sunrise Rock. The cross has been a gathering place for\nEaster services since it was first put in place; and Sunrise Rock\nand its immediate area continue to be used as a campsite. At one\ntime the cross was accompanied by wooden signs stating “ ‘The\nCross, Erected in Memory of the Dead of All Wars,’ and ‘Erected\n1934 by Members of Veterans of Foregin [sic] Wars, Death Valley\npost 2884.’ ” Buono v. Kempthorne , 527\nF. 3d 758, 769 (CA9 2008). The signs have since disappeared,\nand the cross now stands unmarked. B Frank Buono, respondent here, is\na retired Park Service employee who makes regular visits to the\nPreserve. Buono claims to be offended by the presence of a\nreligious symbol on federal land. He filed suit in the United\nStates District Court for the Central District of California. He\nalleged a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First\nAmendment and sought an injunction requiring the Government to\nremove the cross. The litigation proceeded in what\ncan be described as four stages. In the first, the District Court\nruled in Buono’s favor on opposing motions for summary judgment. Buono v. Norton , 212 F. Supp. 2d 1202 (CD\nCal. 2002) (Buono I) . As an initial matter, the court\nfound that Buono had standing to maintain his Establishment Clause\nchallenge. Id., at 1210–1214. On the merits, the parties\nagreed that the dispute should be governed by the so-called Lemon test, which the District Court formulated as\nfollows: “A government religious practice or symbol will\nsurvive an Establishment Clause challenge when it (1) has a\nsecular purpose, (2) has a primary effect that neither advances nor\ninhibits religion, and (3) does not foster excessive state\nentanglement with religion.” Buono I , supra , at\n1214–1215 (citing Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U. S. 602 , 612–613\n(1971)). The court expressly declined to consider whether\nthe Government’s actions regarding the cross had a secular purpose,\n212 F. Supp. 2d, at 1214–1215, or whether they caused\nexcessive entanglement with religion, id., at 1217,\nn. 9. Instead, the court evaluated the primary effect of the\ncross by asking how it would be viewed by a “reasonable observer.” Id., at 1216. Concluding that presence of the cross on\nfederal land conveyed an impression of governmental endorsement of\nreligion, the court granted Buono’s request for injunctive relief.\nThe court’s order in Buono I (2002 injunction) permanently\nforbade the Government “from permitting the display of the Latin\ncross in the area of Sunrise Rock in the Mojave National Preserve.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 146a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit stayed the 2002 injunction to the extent that it\nrequired the cross to be removed or dismantled but did not forbid\nalternative methods of complying with the order. The Government\ncovered the cross, first with a tarpaulin and later with a plywood\nbox. On appeal, the judgment of the District Court\nwas affirmed, both as to standing and on the merits of Buono’s\nEstablishment Clause challenge. Buono v. Norton ,\n371 F. 3d 543 (CA9 2004) (Buono II) . Like the\nDistrict Court, the Court of Appeals did not decide whether the\nGovernment’s action, or nonaction, with respect to the cross had\nbeen motivated by a secular purpose. Id., at 550. Its\nruling was based instead on the conclusion that a reasonable\nobserver would perceive a cross on federal land as governmental\nendorsement of religion. Id., at 549–550. The Government\ndid not seek review by this Court, so that the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals in Buono II became final. C During the relevant proceedings,\nCongress enacted certain statutes related to the cross: (1) Before Buono I was\nfiled, Congress passed an appropriations bill that included a\nprovision forbidding the use of governmental funds to remove the\ncross. Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. 106–554,\n§133, 114 Stat. 2763A–230. (2) While Buono I was pending before\nthe District Court, Congress designated the cross and its adjoining\nland “as a national memorial commemorating United States\nparticipation in World War I and honoring the American veterans of\nthat war.” Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2002, Pub. L.\n107–117, §8137(a), 115 Stat. 2278. The Secretary of the Interior\nwas directed to expend up to $10,000 to acquire a replica of the\noriginal cross and its memorial plaque and to install the plaque at\na suitable nearby location. §8137(c). (3) Three months after Buono I was\ndecided, Congress again prohibited the spending of governmental\nfunds to remove the cross. Department of Defense Appropriations\nAct, 2003, Pub. L. 107–248, §8065(b), 116 Stat. 1551. (4) While the Government’s appeal in Buono\nII was pending, Congress passed a statute (land-transfer\nstatute) directing the Secretary of the Interior to transfer to the\nVFW the Government’s interest in the land that had been designated\na national memorial. Department of Defense Appropriations Act,\n2004, Pub. L. 108–87, §8121(a), 117 Stat. 1100. In exchange, the\nGovernment was to receive land elsewhere in the preserve from Henry\nSandoz and his wife. Ibid. Any difference in value between\nthe two parcels would be equalized through a cash payment.\n§§8121(c), (d). The land-transfer statute provided that the\nproperty would revert to the Government if not maintained “as a\nmemorial commemorating United States participation in World War I\nand honoring the American veterans of that war.” §8121(e), 117\nStat. 1100. The statute presents a central issue in this case. The Court of Appeals in Buono II did\nnot address the effect on the suit of a potential land transfer\nunder the statute. The court noted that the transfer might “take as\nlong as two years to complete,” 371 F. 3d, at 545, and that\nits effect was not yet known, id., at 545–546. The court\nthus “express[ed] no view as to whether a transfer completed under\n[the statute] would pass constitutional muster.” Id., at\n546. D After the Court of Appeals\naffirmed in Buono II , Buono returned to the District Court\nseeking to prevent the land transfer. He sought injunctive relief\nagainst the transfer, either through enforcement or modification of\nthe 2002 injunction. In evaluating his request the trial court\ndescribed the relevant question as whether the land transfer was a\nbona fide attempt to comply with the injunction (as the Government\nclaimed), or a sham aimed at keeping the cross in place (as Buono\nclaimed). Buono v. Norton , 364 F. Supp. 2d\n1175, 1178 (CD Cal. 2005) (Buono III) . In Buono\nIII , the court did not consider whether the transfer itself\nwas an “independent violation of the Establishment Clause.” Id., at 1182, n. 8. The court nevertheless concluded\nthat the transfer was an attempt by the Government to keep the\ncross atop Sunrise Rock and so was invalid. The court granted\nBuono’s motion to enforce the 2002 injunction; denied as moot his\nmotion to amend it; and permanently enjoined the Government from\nimplementing the land-transfer statute. Id., at 1182. The Court of Appeals again\naffirmed, largely following the reasoning of the District Court. Buono v. Kempthorne , 502 F. 3d 1069 (CA9\n2007). The Government’s motion for rehearing en banc was denied\nover a dissent by Judge O’Scannlain, 527 F. 3d 758, and this\nCourt granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009). II Before considering the District\nCourt’s order on the merits, the first inquiry must be with respect\nto Buono’s standing to maintain this action. To demonstrate\nstanding, a plaintiff must have “alleged such a personal stake in\nthe outcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.” Horne v. Flores , 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Government argues that\nBuono’s asserted injury is not personal to him and so does not\nconfer Article III standing. As noted above, Buono does not find\nthe cross itself objectionable but instead takes offense at the\npresence of a religious symbol on federal land. Buono does not\nclaim that, as a personal matter, he has been made to feel excluded\nor coerced, and so, the Government contends, he cannot object to\nthe presence of the cross. Brief for Petitioners 12–17. Whatever the validity of the\nobjection to Buono’s standing, that argument is not available to\nthe Government at this stage of the litigation. When Buono moved\nthe District Court in Buono I for an injunction requiring\nthe removal of the cross, the Government raised the same standing\nobjections it proffers now. Rejecting the Government’s position,\nthe District Court entered a judgment in Buono’s favor, which the\nCourt of Appeals affirmed in Buono II . The Government did\nnot seek review in this Court. The judgment became final and\nunreviewable upon the expiration of the 90-day deadline under 28 U.\nS. C. §2101(c) for filing a petition for certiorari. Toledo Scale Co. v. Computing Scale Co. , 261 U. S. 399 , 418\n(1923); see Missouri v. Jenkins , 495 U. S. 33 , 45 (1990)\n(90-day deadline is “mandatory and jurisdictional”). The Government\ncannot now contest Buono’s standing to obtain the final judgment in Buono I . Of course, even though the Court may not\nreconsider whether Buono had standing to seek the 2002 injunction,\nit is still necessary to evaluate his standing in Buono\nIII to seek application of the injunction against the\nland-transfer statute. That measure of relief is embodied in the\njudgment upon which we granted review. This was a measure of relief that Buono had\nstanding to seek. A party that obtains a judgment in its favor\nacquires a “judicially cognizable” interest in ensuring compliance\nwith that judgment. See Allen v. Wright , 468 U. S. 737 , 763\n(1984) (plaintiffs’ right to enforce a desegregation decree to\nwhich they were parties is “a personal interest, created by law, in\nhaving the State refrain from taking specific actions”). Having\nobtained a final judgment granting relief on his claims, Buono had\nstanding to seek its vindication. The Government does not deny this proposition\nas a general matter. Instead, it argues that Buono was not seeking\nto vindicate—but rather to extend—the 2002 injunction. The first\ninjunction forbade the Government from maintaining the cross on\nSunrise Rock; yet in Buono III he sought to preclude the\nland transfer, a different governmental action. The Government\ncontends that Buono lacked standing to seek this additional relief.\nReply Brief for Petitioners 5. The Government’s argument, however, is\nproperly addressed to the relief granted by the judgment below, not\nto Buono’s standing to seek that relief. The Government has\nchallenged whether appropriate relief was granted in Buono\nIII in light of the relevant considerations and legal\nprinciples, and we shall consider these questions. The standing\ninquiry, by contrast, turns on the alleged injury that prompted the\nplaintiff to invoke the court’s jurisdiction in the first place.\nBuono’s entitlement to an injunction having been established in Buono I and II , he sought in Buono III to prevent the Government from frustrating or evading that\ninjunction. Based on the rights he obtained under the earlier\ndecree—against the same party, regarding the same cross and the\nsame land—his interests in doing so were sufficiently personal and\nconcrete to support his standing. Although Buono also argued that\nthe land transfer should be prohibited as an “independent”\nEstablishment Clause violation, the District Court did not address\nor order relief on that claim, which is not before us. Buono\nIII, 364 F. Supp. 2d, at 1182, n. 8. This is not a\ncase in which a party seeks to import a previous standing\ndetermination into a wholly different dispute. In arguing that Buono sought to extend, rather\nthan to enforce, the 2002 injunction, the Government in essence\ncontends that the injunction did not provide a basis for the\nDistrict Court to invalidate the land transfer. This is not an\nargument about standing but about the merits of the District\nCourt’s order. Those points now must be addressed. III The procedural history of this\nlitigation must be considered to identify the issues now subject to\nreview. The District Court granted the 2002 injunction after\nconcluding that a cross on federal land violated the Establishment\nClause. The Government unsuccessfully challenged that conclusion on\nappeal, and the judgment became final upon completion of direct\nreview. At that point, the judgment “became res judicata to the\nparties and those in privity with them, not only as to every matter\nwhich was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or\ndemand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been\noffered for that purpose.” Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Bailey , 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 14)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Government therefore does\nnot—and could not—ask this Court to reconsider the propriety of the\n2002 injunction or the District Court’s reasons for granting\nit. The question now before the Court\nis whether the District Court properly enjoined the Government from\nimplementing the land-transfer statute. The District Court did not\nconsider whether the statute, in isolation, would have violated the\nEstablishment Clause, and it did not forbid the land transfer as an\nindependent constitutional violation. Buono III , supra , at 1182, n. 8. Rather, the court enjoined\ncompliance with the statute on the premise that the relief was\nnecessary to protect the rights Buono had secured through the 2002\ninjunction. An injunction is an exercise of a court’s\nequitable authority, to be ordered only after taking into account\nall of the circumstances that bear on the need for prospective\nrelief. See United States v. Swift & Co. , 286 U. S. 106 ,\n114 (1932). See also Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo , 456 U. S. 305 , 312\n(1982); Hecht Co. v. Bowles , 321 U. S. 321 , 329\n(1944); 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice\nand Procedure §2942, pp. 39–42 (2d ed. 1995) (hereinafter\nWright & Miller). Equitable relief is not granted as a matter\nof course, see Weinberger , 456 U. S., at 311–312, and a\ncourt should be particularly cautious when contemplating relief\nthat implicates public interests, see id., at 312 (“In\nexercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should pay\nparticular regard for the public consequences in employing the\nextraordinary remedy of injunction”); Harrisonville v. W. S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co. , 289 U. S. 334 , 338\n(1933) (“Where an important public interest would be prejudiced,\nthe reasons for denying the injunction may be compelling”). Because\ninjunctive relief “is drafted in light of what the court believes\nwill be the future course of events, … a court must never ignore\nsignificant changes in the law or circumstances underlying an\ninjunction lest the decree be turned into an ‘instrument of\nwrong.’ ” Wright & Miller §2961, at 393–394 (quoting Swift & Co. , supra , at 115). Here, the District Court did not engage in the\nappropriate inquiry. The land-transfer statute was a substantial\nchange in circumstances bearing on the propriety of the requested\nrelief. The court, however, did not acknowledge the statute’s\nsignificance. It examined the events that led to the statute’s\nenactment and found an intent to prevent removal of the cross.\nDeeming this intent illegitimate, the court concluded that nothing\nof moment had changed. This was error. Even assuming that the\nland-transfer statute was an attempt to prevent removal of the\ncross, it does not follow that an injunction against its\nimplementation was appropriate. By dismissing Congress’s motives as illicit,\nthe District Court took insufficient account of the context in\nwhich the statute was enacted and the reasons for its passage.\nPrivate citizens put the cross on Sunrise Rock to commemorate\nAmerican servicemen who had died in World War I. Although certainly\na Christian symbol, the cross was not emplaced on Sunrise Rock to\npromote a Christian message. Cf. County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh\nChapter , 492 U.\nS. 573 , 661 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part) (“[T]he [Establishment] Clause forbids a\ncity to permit the permanent erection of a large Latin cross on the\nroof of city hall … because such an obtrusive year-round religious\ndisplay would place the government’s weight behind an obvious\neffort to proselytize on behalf of a particular religion”).\nPlacement of the cross on Government-owned land was not an attempt\nto set the imprimatur of the state on a particular creed.\nRather, those who erected the cross intended simply to honor our\nNation’s fallen soldiers. See Brief for Veterans of Foreign Wars of\nthe United States et al. as Amici Curiae 15 (noting\nthat the plaque accompanying the cross “was decorated with VFW\ndecals”). Time also has played its role. The cross had\nstood on Sunrise Rock for nearly seven decades before the statute\nwas enacted. By then, the cross and the cause it commemorated had\nbecome entwined in the public consciousness. See ibid. Members of the public gathered regularly at Sunrise Rock to pay\ntheir respects. Rather than let the cross deteriorate, community\nmembers repeatedly took it upon themselves to replace it. Congress\nultimately designated the cross as a national memorial, ranking it\namong those monuments honoring the noble sacrifices that constitute\nour national heritage. See note following 16 U. S. C. §431\n(listing officially designated national memorials, including the\nNational D-Day Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial).\nResearch d",

IMS HEALTH INC. et al. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the second circuit No. 10–779. Argued April 26, 2011—Decided June 23,\n2011 Pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their drugs to\ndoctors through a process called “detailing.” Pharmacies receive\n“prescriber-identifying information” when processing prescriptions\nand sell the information to “data miners,” who produce reports on\nprescriber behavior and lease their reports to pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers. “Detailers” employed by pharmaceutical manufacturers\nthen use the reports to refine their marketing tactics and increase\nsales to doctors. Vermont’s Prescription Confidentiality Law\nprovides that, absent the prescriber’s consent,\nprescriber-identifying information may not be sold by pharmacies\nand similar entities, disclosed by those entities for marketing\npurposes, or used for marketing by pharmaceutical manufacturers.\nVt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, §4631(d). The prohibitions are subject to\nexceptions that permit the prescriber-identifying information to be\ndisseminated and used for a number of purposes, e.g., “health care research.” §4631(e). Respondents, Vermont data\nminers and an association of brand-name drug manufacturers, sought\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against state officials\n(hereinafter Vermont), contending that §4631(d) violates their\nrights under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. The\nDistrict Court denied relief, but the Second Circuit reversed,\nholding that §4631(d) unconstitutionally burdens the speech of\npharmaceutical marketers and data miners without adequate\njustification. Held : 1. Vermont’s statute, which\nimposes content- and speaker-based burdens on protected expression,\nis subject to heightened judicial scrutiny. Pp. 6–15. (a) On its face, the\nlaw enacts a content- and speaker-based restriction on the sale,\ndisclosure, and use of prescriber-identifying information. The law\nfirst forbids sale subject to exceptions based in large part on the\ncontent of a purchaser’s speech. It then bars pharmacies from\ndisclosing the information when recipient speakers will use that\ninformation for marketing. Finally, it prohibits pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers from using the information for marketing. The statute\nthus disfavors marketing, i.e., speech with a particular\ncontent, as well as particular speakers , i.e. , detailers\nengaged in marketing on behalf of pharmaceutical manufacturers. Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc. , 507 U. S. 410 , 426; Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC , 512 U. S. 622 , 658. Yet\nthe law allows prescriber-identifying information to be purchased,\nacquired, and used for other types of speech and by other speakers.\nThe record and formal legislative findings of purpose confirm that\n§4631(d) imposes an aimed, content-based burden on detailers, in\nparticular detailers who promote brand-name drugs. In practical\noperation, Vermont’s law “goes even beyond mere content\ndiscrimination, to actual viewpoint discrimination.” R. A. V. v. St. Paul , 505 U. S. 377 ,\n391. Heightened judicial scrutiny is warranted. Pp. 8–11. (b) Vermont errs in\narguing that heightened scrutiny is unwarranted. The State contends\nthat its law is a mere commercial regulation. Far from having only\nan incidental effect on speech, however, §4631(d) imposes a burden\nbased on the content of speech and the identity of the speaker. The\nState next argues that, because prescriber-identifying information\nwas generated in compliance with a legal mandate, §4631(d) is akin\nto a restriction on access to government-held information. That\nargument finds some support in Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp. , 528 U. S. 32 , but that\ncase is distinguishable. Vermont has imposed a restriction on\naccess to information in private hands. United Reporting reserved that situation— i.e., “a case in which the\ngovernment is prohibiting a speaker from conveying information that\nthe speaker already possesses.” Id., at 40. In addition,\nthe United Reporting plaintiff was presumed to have\nsuffered no personal First Amendment injury, while respondents\nclaim that §4631(d) burdens their own speech. That circumstance\nwarrants heightened scrutiny. Vermont also argues that heightened\njudicial scrutiny is unwarranted because sales, transfer, and use\nof prescriber-identifying information are conduct, not speech.\nHowever, the creation and dissemination of information are speech\nfor First Amendment purposes. See, e.g. , Bartnicki v. Vopper , 532 U. S. 514 , 527.\nThere is no need to consider Vermont’s request for an exception to\nthat rule. Section 4631(d) imposes a speaker- and content-based\nburden on protected expression, and that circumstance is sufficient\nto justify applying heightened scrutiny, even assuming that\nprescriber-identifying information is a mere commodity.\nPp. 11–15. 2. Vermont’s justifications for §4631(d)\ndo not withstand heightened scrutiny. Pp. 15–24. (a) The outcome here is\nthe same whether a special commercial speech inquiry or a stricter\nform of judicial scrutiny is applied, see, e.g. , Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Assn., Inc. v. United\nStates , 527 U.\nS. 173 , 184. To sustain §4631(d)’s targeted, content-based\nburden on protected expression, Vermont must show at least that the\nstatute directly advances a substantial governmental interest and\nthat the measure is drawn to achieve that interest. See Board\nof Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469 , 480–481.\nVermont contends that its law (1) is necessary to protect medical\nprivacy, including physician confidentiality, avoidance of\nharassment, and the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship,\nand (2) is integral to the achievement of the policy objectives of\nimproving public health and reducing healthcare costs.\nPp. 15–17. (b) Assuming that\nphysicians have an interest in keeping their prescription decisions\nconfidential, §4631(d) is not drawn to serve that interest.\nPharmacies may share prescriber-identifying information with anyone\nfor any reason except for marketing. Vermont might have addressed\nphysician confidentiality through “a more coherent policy,” Greater New Orleans Broadcasting , supra , at 195,\nsuch as allowing the information’s sale or disclosure in only a few\nnarrow and well-justified circumstances. But it did not. Given the\ninformation’s widespread availability and many permissible uses,\nVermont’s asserted interest in physician confidentiality cannot\njustify the burdens that §4631(d) imposes on protected expression.\nIt is true that doctors can forgo the law’s advantages by\nconsenting to the sale, disclosure, and use of their\nprescriber-identifying information. But the State has offered only\na contrived choice: Either consent, which will allow the doctor’s\nprescriber-identifying information to be disseminated and used\nwithout constraint; or, withhold consent, which will allow the\ninformation to be used by those speakers whose message the State\nsupports. Cf. Rowan v. Post Office Dept. , 397 U. S. 728 .\nRespondents suggest a further defect lies in §4631(d)’s presumption\nof applicability absent an individual election to the contrary.\nReliance on a prior election, however, would not save a privacy\nmeasure that imposed an unjustified burden on protected expression.\nVermont also asserts that its broad content-based rule is necessary\nto avoid harassment, but doctors can simply decline to meet with\ndetailers. Cf. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N. Y.,\nInc. v. Village of Stratton , 536 U. S. 150 , 168.\nVermont further argues that detailers’ use of\nprescriber-identifying information undermines the doctor-patient\nrelationship by allowing detailers to influence treatment\ndecisions. But if pharmaceutical marketing affects treatment\ndecisions, it can do so only because it is persuasive. Fear that\nspeech might persuade provides no lawful basis for quieting it.\nPp. 17–21. (c) While Vermont’s\ngoals of lowering the costs of medical services and promoting\npublic health may be proper, §4631(d) does not advance them in a\npermissible way. Vermont seeks to achieve those objectives through\nthe indirect means of restraining certain speech by certain\nspeakers— i.e., by diminishing detailers’ ability to\ninfluence prescription decisions. But “the fear that people would\nmake bad decisions if given truthful information” cannot justify\ncontent-based burdens on speech. Thompson v. Western\nStates Medical Center , 535 U. S. 357 , 374. That\nprecept applies with full force when the audience—here, prescribing\nphysicians—consists of “sophisticated and experienced” consumers. Edenfield v. Fane , 507 U. S. 761 , 775. The\ninstant law’s defect is made clear by the fact that many listeners\nfind detailing instructive. Vermont may be displeased that\ndetailers with prescriber-indentifying information are effective in\npromoting brand-name drugs, but the State may not burden protected\nexpression in order to tilt public debate in a preferred direction.\nVermont nowhere contends that its law will prevent false or\nmisleading speech within the meaning of this Court’s First\nAmendment precedents. The State’s interest in burdening detailers’\nspeech thus turns on nothing more than a difference of opinion.\nPp. 21–24. 630 F. 3d 263, affirmed. Kennedy, J., delivered the\nopinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Scalia,\nThomas, Alito, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined. Breyer, J., filed a\ndissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg and Kagan, JJ., joined. OPINION OF THE COURT SORRELL V. IMS HEALTH INC. 564 U. S. ____ (2011) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 10-779 WILLIAM H. SORRELL, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF VERMONT,\net al., PETITIONERS v. IMS HEALTH INC.\net al. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit [June 23, 2011] Justice Kennedy delivered the\nopinion of the Court. Vermont law restricts the sale,\ndisclosure, and use of pharmacy records that reveal the prescribing\npractices of individual doctors. Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, §4631\n(Supp. 2010). Subject to certain exceptions, the information may\nnot be sold, disclosed by pharmacies for marketing purposes, or\nused for marketing by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Vermont argues\nthat its prohibitions safeguard medical privacy and diminish the\nlikelihood that marketing will lead to prescription decisions not\nin the best interests of patients or the State. It can be assumed\nthat these interests are significant. Speech in aid of\npharmaceutical marketing, however, is a form of expression\nprotected by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. As a\nconsequence, Vermont’s statute must be subjected to heightened\njudicial scrutiny. The law cannot satisfy that standard. I A Pharmaceutical manufacturers\npromote their drugs to doctors through a process called\n“detailing.” This often in- volves a scheduled visit to a doctor’s\noffice to persuade the doctor to prescribe a particular\npharmaceutical. Detailers bring drug samples as well as medical\nstudies that explain the “details” and potential advantages of\nvarious prescription drugs. Interested physicians listen, ask\nquestions, and receive followup data. Salespersons can be more\neffective when they know the background and purchasing preferences\nof their clientele, and pharmaceutical salespersons are no\nexception. Knowledge of a physi- cian’s prescription\npractices—called “prescriber-identifying information”—enables a\ndetailer better to ascertain which doctors are likely to be\ninterested in a particular drug and how best to present a\nparticular sales message. Detailing is an expensive undertaking, so\npharmaceutical companies most often use it to promote high-profit\nbrand-name drugs protected by patent. Once a brand-name drug’s\npatent expires, less expensive bioequivalent generic alternatives\nare manufactured and sold. Pharmacies, as a matter of\nbusiness routine and federal law, receive prescriber-identifying\ninformation when processing prescriptions. See 21 U. S. C.\n§353(b); see also Vt. Bd. of Pharmacy Admin. Rule 9.1 (2009); Rule\n9.2. Many pharmacies sell this information to “data miners,” firms\nthat analyze prescriber-identifying information and produce reports\non prescriber behavior. Data miners lease these reports to\npharmaceutical manufacturers subject to nondisclosure agreements.\nDetailers, who represent the manufacturers, then use the reports to\nrefine their marketing tactics and increase sales. In 2007, Vermont enacted the Prescription\nConfidentiality Law. The measure is also referred to as Act 80. It\nhas several components. The central provision of the present case\nis §4631(d). “A health insurer, a self-insured employer, an\nelectronic transmission intermediary, a pharmacy, or other similar\nentity shall not sell, license, or exchange for value regulated\nrecords containing prescriber-identifiable information, nor permit\nthe use of regulated records containing prescriber-identifiable\ninformation for marketing or promoting a prescription drug, unless\nthe prescriber consents … . Pharmaceutical manufacturers\nand pharmaceutical marketers shall not use prescriber-identifiable\ninformation for marketing or promoting a prescription drug unless\nthe prescriber consents … .” The quoted provision has three component parts. The\nprovision begins by prohibiting pharmacies, health insurers, and\nsimilar entities from selling prescriber-identifying information,\nabsent the prescriber’s consent. The parties here dispute whether\nthis clause applies to all sales or only to sales for marketing.\nThe provision then goes on to prohibit pharmacies, health insurers,\nand similar enti- ties from allowing prescriber-identifying\ninformation to be used for marketing, unless the prescriber\nconsents. This prohibition in effect bars pharmacies from\ndisclosing the information for marketing purposes. Finally, the\nprovision’s second sentence bars pharmaceutical manufacturers and\npharmaceutical marketers from using prescriber-identifying\ninformation for marketing, again absent the prescriber’s consent.\nThe Vermont attorney general may pursue civil remedies against\nviolators. §4631(f). Separate statutory provisions elaborate the\nscope of the prohibitions set out in §4631(d). “Marketing” is\ndefined to include “advertising, promotion, or any activity” that\nis “used to influence sales or the market share of a prescription\ndrug.” §4631(b)(5). Section 4631(c)(1) further provides that\nVermont’s Department of Health must allow “a prescriber to give\nconsent for his or her identifying information to be used for the\npurposes” identified in §4631(d). Finally, the Act’s prohibitions\non sale, disclosure, and use are subject to a list of exceptions.\nFor example, prescriber-identifying information may be disseminated\nor used for “health care research”; to enforce “compliance” with\nhealth insurance formularies, or preferred drug lists; for “care\nmanagement educational communications provided to” patients on such\nmatters as “treatment options”; for law enforcement operations; and\nfor purposes “otherwise provided by law.” §4631(e). Act 80 also authorized funds for an\n“evidence-based pre-scription drug education program” designed to\nprovide doctors and others with “information and education on the\ntherapeutic and cost-effective utilization of prescription drugs.”\n§4622(a)(1). An express aim of the program is to advise prescribers\n“about commonly used brand-name drugs for which the patent has\nexpired” or will soon expire. §4622(a)(2). Similar efforts to\npromote the use of generic pharmaceuticals are sometimes referred\nto as “counter-detailing.” App. 211; see also IMS Health\nInc. v. Ayotte , 550 F. 3d 42, 91 (CA1 2008)\n(Lipez, J., concurring and dissenting). The counterdetailer’s\nrecommended substitute may be an older, less expensive drug and not\na bioequivalent of the brand-name drug the physician might\notherwise prescribe. Like the pharmaceutical manufacturers whose\nefforts they hope to resist, counterdetailers in some States use\nprescriber-identifying information to increase their effectiveness.\nStates themselves may supply the prescriber-identifying information\nused in these programs. See App. 313; id. , at 375 (“[W]e\nuse the data given to us by the State of Pennsylvania … to\nfigure out which physicians to talk to”); see also id ., at\n427–429 (Director of the Office of Vermont Health Access explaining\nthat the office collects prescriber-identifying information but\n“does not at this point in time have a counterdetailing or\ndetailing effort”). As first enacted, Act 80 also required\ndetailers to provide information about alternative treatment\noptions. The Vermont Legislature, however, later repealed that\nprovision. 2008 Vt. Laws No. 89, §3. Act 80 was accompanied by legislative\nfindings. Vt. Acts No. 80, §1. Vermont found, for example, that the\n“goals of marketing programs are often in conflict with the goals\nof the state” and that the “marketplace for ideas on medicine\nsafety and effectiveness is frequently one-sided in that brand-name\ncompanies invest in expensive pharmaceutical marketing campaigns to\ndoctors.” §§1(3), (4). Detailing, in the legislature’s view, caused\ndoctors to make decisions based on “incomplete and biased\ninformation.” §1(4). Because they “are unable to take the time to\nresearch the quickly changing pharmaceutical market,” Vermont\ndoctors “rely on information provided by pharmaceutical\nrepresentatives.” §1(13). The legislature further found that\ndetailing increases the cost of health care and health insurance,\n§1(15); encourages hasty and excessive reliance on brand-name\ndrugs, before the profession has observed their effectiveness as\ncompared with older and less expensive generic alternatives, §1(7);\nand fosters disruptive and repeated marketing visits tantamount to\nharassment, §§1(27)–(28). The legislative findings further noted\nthat use of prescriber-identifying information “increase[s] the\neffect of detailing programs” by allowing detailers to target their\nvisits to particular doctors. §§1(23)–(26). Use of\nprescriber-identifying data also helps detailers shape their\nmessages by “tailoring” their “presentations to individual\nprescriber styles, preferences, and attitudes.” §1(25). B The present case involves two\nconsolidated suits. One was brought by three Vermont data miners,\nthe other by an association of pharmaceutical manufacturers that\nproduce brand-name drugs. These entities are the respondents here.\nContending that §4631(d) violates their First Amendment rights as\nincorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, the respondents sought\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against the petitioners, the\nAttorney General and other officials of the State of Vermont. After a bench trial, the United\nStates District Court for the District of Vermont denied relief.\n631 F. Supp. 2d 434 (2009). The District Court found that\n“[p]harmaceutical manufacturers are essentially the only paying\ncustomers of the data vendor industry” and that, because detailing\nunpatented generic drugs is not “cost-effective,” pharmaceutical\nsales representatives “detail only branded drugs.” Id ., at\n451, 442. As the District Court further con- cluded, “the\nLegislature’s determination that [prescriber-identifying] data is\nan effective marketing tool that enables detailers to increase\nsales of new drugs is supported in the record.” Id ., at\n451. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit\nreversed and remanded. It held that §4631(d) violates the First\nAmendment by burdening the speech of pharmaceutical marketers and\ndata miners without an adequate justification. 630 F. 3d 263.\nJudge Livingston dissented. The decision of the Second Circuit is in\nconflict with de- cisions of the United States Court of Appeals for\nthe First Circuit concerning similar legislation enacted by Maine\nand New Hampshire. See IMS Health Inc. v. Mills ,\n616 F. 3d 7 (CA1 2010) (Maine); Ayotte , supra (New Hamp- shire). Recognizing a division of\nauthority regarding the constitutionality of state statutes, this\nCourt granted certiorari. 562 U. S. __ (2011). II The beginning point is the text\nof §4631(d). In the pro- ceedings below, Vermont stated that the\nfirst sentence of §4631(d) prohibits pharmacies and other regulated\nentities from selling or disseminating prescriber-identifying\ninformation for marketing. The information, in other words, could\nbe sold or given away for purposes other than marketing. The\nDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals accepted the State’s\nreading. See 630 F. 3d, at 276. At oral argument in this\nCourt, however, the State for the first time advanced an\nalternative reading of §4631(d)—namely, that pharmacies, health\ninsurers, and similar entities may not sell prescriber-identifying\ninformation for any purpose, subject to the statutory exceptions\nset out at §4631(e). See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19–20. It might be argued\nthat the State’s newfound interpretation comes too late in the day.\nSee Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine , 537 U. S. 51 , 56,\nn. 4 (2002) (waiver); New Hampshire v. Maine , 532\nU. S. 742 , 749 (2001) (judicial estoppel). The respondents, the\nDistrict Court, and the Court of Appeals were entitled to rely on\nthe State’s plausible interpretation of the law it is charged with\nenforcing. For the State to change its position is particularly\ntroubling in a First Amendment case, where plaintiffs have a\nspecial interest in obtaining a prompt adjudication of their\nrights, despite potential ambiguities of state law. See Houston v. Hill , 482 U. S. 451 , 467–468,\nand n. 17 (1987); Zwickler v. Koota , 389 U. S. 241 ,\n252 (1967). In any event, §4631(d) cannot be\nsustained even under the interpretation the State now adopts. As a\nconsequence this Court can assume that the opening clause of\n§4631(d) prohibits pharmacies, health insurers, and similar\nentities from selling prescriber-identifying information, subject\nto the statutory exceptions set out at §4631(e). Under that\nreading, pharmacies may sell the information to private or academic\nresearchers, see §4631(e)(1), but not, for example, to\npharmaceutical marketers. There is no dispute as to the remainder\nof §4631(d). It prohibits pharmacies, health insurers, and similar\nentities from disclosing or otherwise allowing\nprescriber-identifying information to be used for marketing. And it\nbars pharmaceutical manufacturers and detailers from using the\ninformation for marketing. The questions now are whether §4631(d)\nmust be tested by heightened judicial scrutiny and, if so, whether\nthe State can justify the law. A 1 On its face, Vermont’s law enacts\ncontent- and speaker-based restrictions on the sale, disclosure,\nand use of prescriber-identifying information. The provision first\nforbids sale subject to exceptions based in large part on the\ncontent of a purchaser’s speech. For example, those who wish to\nengage in certain “educational communications,” §4631(e)(4), may\npurchase the information. The measure then bars any disclosure when\nrecipient speakers will use the information for marketing. Finally,\nthe provision’s second sentence prohibits pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers from using the information for marketing. The statute\nthus disfavors marketing, that is, speech with a particular\ncontent. More than that, the statute disfavors specific speakers,\nnamely pharmaceutical manufacturers. As a result of these content-\nand speaker-based rules, detailers cannot obtain\nprescriber-identifying information, even though the information may\nbe purchased or acquired by other speakers with diverse purposes\nand viewpoints. Detailers are likewise barred from using the\ninformation for marketing, even though the information may be used\nby a wide range of other speakers. For example, it appears that\nVermont could supply academic organizations with\nprescriber-identifying information to use in countering the\nmessages of brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and in\npromoting the prescription of generic drugs. But §4631(d) leaves\ndetailers no means of purchasing, acquiring, or using\nprescriber-identifying information. The law on its face burdens\ndisfavored speech by disfavored speakers. Any doubt that §4631(d) imposes\nan aimed, content-based burden on detailers is dispelled by the\nrecord and by formal legislative findings. As the District Court\nnoted, “[p]harmaceutical manufacturers are essentially the only\npaying customers of the data vendor industry”; and the almost\ninvariable rule is that detailing by pharmaceutical manufacturers\nis in support of brand-name drugs. 631 F. Supp. 2d, at 451.\nVermont’s law thus has the effect of preventing detailers—and only\ndetailers—from communicating with physicians in an effective and\ninformative manner. Cf. Edenfield v. Fane , 507 U. S. 761 ,\n766 (1993) (explaining the “considerable value” of in-person\nsolicitation). Formal legislative findings accompanying §4631(d)\nconfirm that the law’s express purpose and practical effect are to\ndiminish the effectiveness of marketing by manufacturers of\nbrand-name drugs. Just as the “inevitable effect of a statute on\nits face may render it unconstitutional,” a statute’s stated\npurposes may also be considered. United States v. O’Brien , 391 U. S. 367 , 384\n(1968). Here, the Vermont Legislature explained that detailers, in\nparticular those who promote brand-name drugs, convey messages that\n“are often in conflict with the goals of the state.” 2007 Vt. No.\n80, §1(3). The legislature designed §4631(d) to target those\nspeakers and their messages for disfavored treatment. “In its\npractical operation,” Vermont’s law “goes even beyond mere content\ndiscrimination, to actual viewpoint discrimination.” R. A. V. v. St. Paul , 505 U. S. 377 ,\n391 (1992). Given the legislature’s expressed statement of purpose,\nit is apparent that §4631(d) imposes burdens that are based on the\ncontent of speech and that are aimed at a particular viewpoint. Act 80 is designed to impose a specific,\ncontent-based burden on protected expression. It follows that\nheightened judicial scrutiny is warranted. See Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc. , 507 U. S. 410 , 418\n(1993) (applying heightened scrutiny to “a categorical prohibition\non the use of newsracks to disseminate commercial messages”); id ., at 429 (“[T]he very basis for the regulation is the\ndifference in content between ordinary newspapers and commercial\nspeech” in the form of “commercial handbills … . Thus, by\nany commonsense understanding of the term, the ban in this case is\n‘content based’ ” (some internal quotation marks omitted));\nsee also Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC , 512 U. S. 622 ,\n658 (1994) (explaining that strict scrutiny applies to regulations\nreflecting “aversion” to what “disfavored speakers” have to say).\nThe Court has recognized that the “distinction between laws\nburdening and laws banning speech is but a matter of degree” and\nthat the “Government’s content-based burdens must satisfy the same\nrigorous scrutiny as its content-based bans.” United\nStates v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. , 529 U. S. 803 , 812\n(2000). Lawmakers may no more silence unwanted speech by burdening\nits utterance than by censoring its content. See Simon &\nSchuster, Inc. v. Mem- bers of N. Y. State Crime Victims\nBd. , 502 U. S.\n105 , 115 (1991) (content-based financial burden); Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm’r\nof Revenue , 460 U. S. 575 (1983) (speaker-based\nfinancial burden). The First Amendment requires heightened\nscrutiny whenever the government creates “a regulation of speech\nbecause of disagreement with the message it conveys.” Ward v. Rock Against Racism , 491 U. S. 781 , 791\n(1989); see also Renton v. Playtime Theatres,\nInc. , 475 U. S.\n41 , 48 (1986) (explaining that “ ‘content-neutral’ speech\nregulations” are “those that are justified without\nreference to the content of the regulated speech” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). A government bent on frustrating an\nimpending demonstration might pass a law demanding two years’\nnotice before the issuance of parade permits. Even if the\nhypothetical measure on its face appeared neutral as to content and\nspeaker, its purpose to suppress speech and its unjustified burdens\non expression would render it unconstitutional. Ibid. Commercial speech is no exception. See Discovery Network , supra , at 429–430 (commercial speech restriction lacking a\n“neutral justification” was not content neutral). A “consumer’s\nconcern for the free flow of commercial speech often may be far\nkeener than his concern for urgent political dialogue.” Bates v. State Bar of Ariz. , 433 U. S. 350 , 364\n(1977). That reality has great relevance in the fields of medicine\nand public health, where information can save lives. 2 The State argues that heightened\njudicial scrutiny is unwarranted because its law is a mere\ncommercial regulation. It is true that restrictions on protected\nexpression are distinct from restrictions on economic activity or,\nmore generally, on nonexpressive conduct. It is also true that the\nFirst Amendment does not prevent restrictions directed at commerce\nor conduct from imposing inciden- tal burdens on speech. That is\nwhy a ban on race-based hiring may require employers to remove\n“ ‘White Applicants Only’ ” signs, Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc. , 547 U. S. 47 , 62\n(2006); why “an ordinance against outdoor fires” might forbid\n“burning a flag,” R. A. V. , supra , at\n385; and why antitrust laws can prohibit “agreements in restraint\nof trade,” Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice\nCo. , 336 U. S.\n490 , 502 (1949). But §4631(d) imposes more than an\nincidental burden on protected expression. Both on its face and in\nits practical operation, Vermont’s law imposes a burden based on\nthe content of speech and the identity of the speaker. See supra , at 8–11. While the burdened speech results from an\neconomic motive, so too does a great deal of vital expression. See Bigelow v. Virginia , 421 U. S. 809 , 818\n(1975); New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , 376 U. S. 254 , 266\n(1964); see also United States v. United Foods,\nInc. , 533 U. S.\n405 , 410–411 (2001) (applying “First Amendment scrutiny” where\nspeech effects were not incidental and noting that “those whose\nbusiness and livelihood depend in some way upon the product\ninvolved no doubt deem First Amendment protection to be just as\nimportant for them as it is for other discrete, little noticed\ngroups”). Vermont’s law does not simply have an effect on speech,\nbut is directed at certain content and is aimed at particular\nspeakers. The Constitution “does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer’s\nSocial Statics.” Lochner v. New York , 198 U. S. 45 , 75 (1905)\n(Holmes, J., dissenting). It does enact the First Amendment. Vermont further argues that §4631(d) regulates\nnot speech but simply access to information. Prescriber-identifying\ninformation was generated in compliance with a legal mandate, the\nState argues, and so could be considered a kind of governmental\ninformation. This argument finds some support in Los Angeles\nPolice Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing Corp. , 528 U. S. 32 (1999), where the Court held that a plaintiff could not raise a\nfacial challenge to a content-based restriction on access to\ngovernment- held information. Because no private party faced a\nthreat of legal punishment, the Court characterized the law at\nissue as “nothing more than a governmental denial of access to\ninformation in its possession.” Id ., at 40. Under those\ncircumstances the special reasons for permitting First Amendment\nplaintiffs to invoke the rights of others did not apply. Id. , at 38–39. Having found that the plaintiff could not\nraise a facial challenge, the Court remanded for consideration of\nan as-applied challenge. Id ., at 41. United\nReporting is thus a case about the availability of facial\nchallenges. The Court did not rule on the merits of any First\nAmendment claim. United Reporting is distinguishable\nin at least two respects. First, Vermont has imposed a restriction\non access to information in private hands. This confronts the Court\nwith a point reserved, and a situation not addressed, in United\nReporting . Here, unlike in United Reporting , we do\nhave “a case in which the government is prohibiting a speaker from\nconveying information that the speaker already possesses.” Id ., at 40. The difference is significant. An individual’s\nright to speak is implicated when information he or she possesses\nis subjected to “restraints on the way in which the information\nmight be used” or disseminated. Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart , 467 U. S. 20 , 32 (1984);\nsee also Bartnicki v. Vopper , 532 U. S. 514 , 527\n(2001); Florida Star v. B. J. F. , 491 U. S. 524 (1989); New York Times Co. v. United States , 403 U. S. 713 (1971) (p",

    "fulltext": "SYLLABUS OCTOBER TERM, 2010 TURNER V. ROGERS SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES TURNER v . ROGERS et al. certiorari to the supreme court of south\ncarolina No. 10–10. Argued March 23, 2011—Decided June 20,\n2011 After a South Carolina family court ordered\npetitioner Turner to pay $51.73 per week to respondent Rogers to\nhelp support their child, Turner repeatedly failed to pay the\namount due and was held in contempt five times. For the first four,\nhe was sentenced to 90 days’ imprisonment, but he ultimately paid\nwhat he owed (twice without being jailed, twice after spending a\nfew days in custody). The fifth time he did not pay but completed a\n6-month sentence. After his release, the family court clerk issued\na new “show cause” order against Turner because he was $5728.76 in\narrears. Both he and Rogers were unrepresented by counsel at his\nbrief civil contempt hearing. The judge found Turner in willful\ncontempt and sentenced him to 12 months in prison without making\nany finding as to his ability to pay or indicating on the contempt\norder form whether he was able to make support payments. After\nTurner completed his sentence, the South Carolina Supreme Court\nrejected his claim that the Federal Constitution entitled him to\ncounsel at his contempt hearing, declaring that civil contempt does\nnot require all the constitutional safeguards applicable in\ncriminal contempt proceedings. Held : 1. Even though Turner has\ncompleted his 12-month sentence, and there are not alleged to be\ncollateral consequences of the contempt determination that might\nkeep the dispute alive, this case is not moot, because it is\n“capable of repetition” while “evading review,” Southern Pac.\nTerminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm’n , 219 U. S. 498 , 515. A\ncase remains live if “(1) the challenged action [is] in its\nduration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or\nexpiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the\nsame complaining party [will] be subjected to the same action\nagain.” Weinstein v. Bradford , 423 U. S. 147 , 149.\nHere, the “challenged action,” Turner’s imprisonment for up to 12\nmonths, is “in its duration too short to be fully litigated”\nthrough the state courts (and arrive here) prior to its\n“expiration.” First Nat’l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti , 435 U. S. 765 , 774. And\nthere is a more than “reasonable” likelihood that Turner will again\nbe “subjected to the same action” because he has frequently failed\nto make his support payments, has been the subject of several civil\ncontempt proceedings, has been imprisoned several times, and is,\nonce again, the subject of civil contempt proceedings for failure\nto pay. DeFunis v. Odegaard , 416 U. S. 312 , and St. Pierre v. United States , 319 U. S. 41 ,\ndistinguished. Pp. 5–7. 2. The Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause does not automatically require the State to provide\ncounsel at civil contempt proceedings to an indigent noncustodial\nparent who is subject to a child support order, even if that\nindividual faces incarceration. In particular, that Clause does not\nrequire that counsel be provided where the opposing parent or other\ncustodian is not represented by counsel and the State provides\nalternative procedural safeguards equivalent to adequate notice of\nthe importance of the ability to pay, a fair opportunity to\npresent, and to dispute, relevant information, and express court\nfindings as to the supporting parent’s ability to comply with the\nsupport order. Pp. 7–16. (a) This Court’s\nprecedents provide no definitive answer to the question whether\ncounsel must be provided. The Sixth Amendment grants an indigent\ncriminal defendant the right to counsel, see, e.g., United States v. Dixon , 509 U. S. 688 , 696, but\ndoes not govern civil cases. Civil and criminal contempt differ. A\ncourt may not impose punishment “in a civil contempt proceeding\nwhen it is clearly established that the alleged contemnor is unable\nto comply with the terms of the order.” Hicks v. Feiock , 485\nU. S. 624 , 638, n. 9. And once a civil contemnor complies\nwith the underlying order, he is purged of the contempt and is\nfree. Id. , at 633. The Due Process Clause allows a State\nto provide fewer procedural protections in civil contempt\nproceedings than in a criminal case. Id. , at 637–641.\nCases directly concerning a right to counsel in civil cases have\nfound a presumption of such a right “ only ” in cases\ninvolving incarceration, but have not held that a right to counsel\nexists in all such cases. See In re Gault , 387 U. S. 1 ; Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480 ; and Lassiter v. Department of Social Servs. of Durham\nCty. , 452 U. S.\n18 . Pp. 7–10. (b) Because a contempt\nproceeding to compel support payments is civil, the question\nwhether the “specific dictates of due process” require appointed\ncounsel is determined by examining the “distinct factors” this\nCourt has used to decide what specific safeguards are needed to\nmake a civil proceeding fundamentally fair. Mathews v. Eldridge , 424 U. S. 319 , 335. As\nrelevant here those factors include (1) the nature of “the private\ninterest that will be affected,” (2) the comparative “risk” of an\n“erroneous deprivation” of that interest with and without\n“additional or substitute procedural safeguards,” and (3) the\nnature and magnitude of any countervailing interest in not\nproviding “additional or substitute procedural requirement[s].” Ibid. The “private interest that will be affected”\nargues strongly for the right to counsel here. That interest\nconsists of an indigent defendant’s loss of personal liberty\nthrough imprisonment. Freedom “from bodily restraint” lies “at the\ncore of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.” Foucha v. Louisiana , 504 U. S. 71 , 80. Thus,\naccurate decisionmaking as to the “ability to pay”—which marks a\ndividing line between civil and criminal contempt, Hicks,\nsupra , at 635, n. 7—must be assured because an incorrect\ndecision can result in a wrongful incarceration. And because\nability to comply divides civil and criminal contempt proceedings,\nan erroneous determination would also deprive a defendant of the\nprocedural protections a criminal proceeding would demand.\nQuestions about ability to pay are likely to arise frequently in\nchild custody cases. On the other hand, due process does not always\nrequire the provision of counsel in civil proceedings where\nincarceration is threatened. See Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778 . To determine whether a right to counsel is required here, opposing\ninterests and the probable value of “additional or substitute\nprocedural safeguards” must be taken into account. Mathews,\nsupra , at 335. Doing so reveals three related considerations\nthat, taken together, argue strongly against requiring counsel in\nevery proceeding of the present kind. First, the likely critical\nquestion in these cases is the defendant’s ability to pay, which is\noften closely related to his indigence and relatively\nstraightforward. Second, sometimes, as here, the person opposing\nthe defendant at the hearing is not the government represented by\ncounsel but the custodial parent un represented by counsel.\nA requirement that the State provide counsel to the noncustodial\nparent in these cases could create an asymmetry of representation\nthat would “alter significantly the nature of the proceeding,” Gagnon, supra , at 787, creating a degree of formality or\ndelay that would unduly slow payment to those immediately in need\nand make the proceedings less fair overall. Third, as the\nFederal Government points out, an available set of “substitute\nprocedural safeguards,” Mathews, supra , at 335, if\nemployed together, can significantly reduce the risk of an\nerroneous deprivation of liberty. These include (1) notice to the\ndefendant that his “ability to pay” is a critical issue in the\ncontempt proceeding; (2) the use of a form (or the equivalent) to\nelicit relevant financial information from him; (3) an opportunity\nat the hearing for him to respond to statements and questions about\nhis financial status; and (4) an express finding by the court that\nthe defendant has the ability to pay. This decision does not address civil contempt\nproceedings where the underlying support payment is owed to the\nState, e.g., for reimbursement of welfare funds paid to\nthe custodial parent, or the question what due process requires in\nan unusually complex case where a defendant “can fairly be\nrepresented only by a trained advocate,” Gagnon, supra , at\n788. Pp. 10–16. 3. Under the circumstances, Turner’s\nincarceration violated due process because he received neither\ncounsel nor the benefit of alternative procedures like those the\nCourt describes. He did not have clear notice that his ability to\npay would constitute the critical question in his civil contempt\nproceeding. No one provided him with a form (or the equivalent)\ndesigned to elicit information about his financial circumstances.\nAnd the trial court did not find that he was able to pay his\narrearage, but nonetheless found him in civil contempt and ordered\nhim incarcerated. P. 16. 387 S. C. 142, 691 S. E. 2d 470, vacated\nand remanded. Breyer, J., delivered the opinion\nof the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan,\nJJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which\nScalia, J., joined, and in which Roberts, C. J., and Alito,\nJJ., joined as to Parts I–B and II. OPINION OF THE COURT TURNER V. ROGERS 564 U. S. ____ (2011) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 10-10 MICHAEL D. TURNER, PETITIONER v. REBECCA\nL. ROGERS et al. on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of south\ncarolina [June 20, 2011] Justice Breyer delivered the\nopinion of the Court. South Carolina’s Family Court\nenforces its child support orders by threatening with incarceration\nfor civil contempt those who are (1) subject to a child support\norder, (2) able to comply with that order, but (3) fail to do so.\nWe must decide whether the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause requires the State to provide counsel (at a civil contempt\nhearing) to an indigent person potentially faced with such\nincarceration. We conclude that where as here the custodial parent\n(entitled to receive the support) is unrepresented by counsel, the\nState need not provide counsel to the noncustodial parent (required\nto provide the support). But we attach an important caveat, namely,\nthat the State must nonetheless have in place alternative\nprocedures that assure a fundamentally fair determination of the\ncritical incarceration-related question, whether the supporting\nparent is able to comply with the support order. I A South Carolina family courts\nenforce their child support orders in part through civil contempt\nproceedings. Each month the family court clerk reviews outstanding\nchild support orders, identifies those in which the supporting\nparent has fallen more than five days behind, and sends that parent\nan order to “show cause” why he should not be held in contempt.\nS. C. Rule Family Ct. 24 (2011). The “show cause” order and\nattached affidavit refer to the relevant child support order,\nidentify the amount of the arrearage, and set a date for a court\nhearing. At the hearing that parent may demonstrate that he is not\nin contempt, say, by showing that he is not able to make the\nrequired payments. See Moseley v. Mosier , 279\nS. C. 348, 351, 306 S. E. 2d 624, 626 (1983) (“When the\nparent is unable to make the required payments, he is not\nin contempt”). If he fails to make the required showing, the court\nmay hold him in civil contempt. And it may require that he be\nimprisoned unless and until he purges himself of contempt by making\nthe required child support payments (but not for more than one year\nregardless). See S. C. Code Ann. §63–3–620 (Supp. 2010)\n(imprisonment for up to one year of “adult who wilfully violates” a\ncourt order); Price v. Turner , 387 S. C.\n142, 145, 691 S. E. 2d 470, 472 (2010) (civil contempt order\nmust permit purging of contempt through compliance). B In June 2003 a South Carolina\nfamily court entered an order, which (as amended) required\npetitioner, Michael Turner, to pay $51.73 per week to respondent,\nRebecca Rogers, to help support their child. (Rogers’ father, Larry\nPrice, currently has custody of the child and is also a respondent\nbefore this Court.) Over the next three years, Turner repeatedly\nfailed to pay the amount due and was held in contempt on five\noccasions. The first four times he was sentenced to 90 days’\nimprisonment, but he ultimately paid the amount due (twice without\nbeing jailed, twice after spending two or three days in custody).\nThe fifth time he did not pay but completed a 6-month sentence. After his release in 2006 Turner\nremained in arrears. On March 27, 2006, the clerk issued a new\n“show cause” order. And after an initial postponement due to\nTurner’s failure to appear, Turner’s civil contempt hearing took\nplace on January 3, 2008. Turner and Rogers were present, each\nwithout representation by counsel. The hearing was brief. The court clerk said\nthat Turner was $5,728.76 behind in his payments. The judge asked\nTurner if there was “anything you want to say.” Turner replied, “Well, when I first got out, I got back on dope. I\ndone meth, smoked pot and everything else, and I paid a little bit\nhere and there. And, when I finally did get to working, I broke my\nback, back in September. I filed for disability and SSI. And, I\ndidn’t get straightened out off the dope until I broke my back and\nlaid up for two months. And, now I’m off the dope and everything. I\njust hope that you give me a chance. I don’t know what else to say.\nI mean, I know I done wrong, and I should have been paying and\nhelping her, and I’m sorry. I mean, dope had a hold to me.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 17a. The judge then said, “[o]kay,” and asked Rogers if\nshe had anything to say. Ibid. After a brief discussion of\nfederal benefits, the judge stated, “If there’s nothing else, this will be the Order of\nthe Court. I find the Defendant in willful contempt. I’m [going to]\nsentence him to twelve months in the Oconee County Detention\nCenter. He may purge himself of the contempt and avoid the sentence\nby having a zero balance on or before his release. I’ve also placed\na lien on any SSI or other benefits.” Id. , at 18a. The judge added that Turner would not receive\ngood-time or work credits, but “[i]f you’ve got a job, I’ll make\nyou eligible for work release.” Ibid. When Turner asked\nwhy he could not receive good-time or work credits, the judge said,\n“[b]ecause that’s my ruling.” Ibid. The court made no express finding concerning\nTurner’s ability to pay his arrearage (though Turner’s wife had\nvoluntarily submitted a copy of Turner’s application for disability\nbenefits, cf. post , at 7, n. 3 (Thomas, J.,\ndissenting); App. 135a–136a). Nor did the judge ask any followup\nquestions or otherwise address the ability-to-pay issue. After the\nhearing, the judge filled out a prewritten form titled “Order for\nContempt of Court,” which included the statement: “Defendant (was) (was not) gainfully employed\nand/or (had) (did not have) the ability to make these support\npayments when due.” Id. , at 60a, 61a. But the judge left this statement as is without\nindicating whether Turner was able to make support payments. C While serving his 12-month\nsentence, Turner, with the help of pro bono counsel,\nappealed. He claimed that the Federal Constitution entitled him to\ncounsel at his con- tempt hearing. The South Carolina Supreme Court\ndecided Turner’s appeal after he had completed his sentence. And it\nrejected his “right to counsel” claim. The court pointed out that\ncivil contempt differs significantly from criminal contempt. The\nformer does not require all the “constitutional safeguards”\napplicable in criminal proceedings. 387 S. C., at 145, 691\nS. E. 2d, at 472. And the right to government-paid counsel,\nthe Supreme Court held, was one of the “safeguards” not required. Ibid. Turner sought certiorari. In\nlight of differences among state courts (and some federal courts)\non the applicability of a “right to counsel” in civil contempt\nproceedings enforcing child support orders, we granted the writ.\nCompare, e.g. , Pasqua v. Council , 186\nN. J. 127, 141–146, 892 A. 2d 663, 671–674 (2006); Black v. Division of Child Support Enforcement ,\n686 A. 2d 164, 167–168 (Del. 1996); Mead v. Batchlor , 435 Mich. 480, 488–505, 460 N. W. 2d 493,\n496–504 (1990); Ridgway v. Baker , 720 F. 2d\n1409, 1413–1415 (CA5 1983) (all finding a federal constitutional\nright to counsel for indigents facing imprisonment in a child\nsupport civil contempt proceeding), with Rodriguez v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Ct. , County of Clark , 120\nNev. 798, 808–813, 102 P. 3d 41, 48–51 (2004) (no right to\ncounsel in civil contempt hearing for nonsupport, except in “rarest\nof cases”); Andrews v. Walton , 428 So. 2d\n663, 666 (Fla. 1983) (“no circumstances in which a parent is\nentitled to court-appointed counsel in a civil contempt proceeding\nfor failure to pay child support”). Compare also In re\nGrand Jury Proceedings , 468 F. 2d 1368, 1369 (CA9 1972) (per curiam) (general right to counsel in civil contempt\nproceedings), with Duval v. Duval , 114 N. H.\n422, 425–427, 322 A. 2d 1, 3–4 (1974) (no general right, but\ncounsel may be required on case-by-case basis). II Respondents argue that this case\nis moot. See Massachusetts v. Mellon , 262 U. S. 447 , 480\n(1923) (Article III judicial power extends only to actual “cases”\nand “controversies”); Alvarez v. Smith , 558 U. S.\n__, __ (2009) (slip op., at 4) (“An actual controversy must be\nextant at all stages of review” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). They point out that Turner completed his 12-month prison\nsentence in 2009. And they add that there are no “collateral\nconsequences” of that particular contempt determination that might\nkeep the dispute alive. Compare Sibron v. New\nYork , 392 U. S.\n40 , 55–56 (1968) (release from prison does not moot a criminal case because “collateral consequences” are\npresumed to continue), with Spencer v. Kemna , 523 U. S. 1 , 14\n(1998) (declining to extend the presumption to parole\nrevocation). The short, conclusive answer to\nrespondents’ mootness claim, however, is that this case is not moot\nbecause it falls within a special category of disputes that are\n“capable of repetition” while “evading review.” Southern\nPacific Terminal Co. v. ICC , 219 U. S. 498 , 515\n(1911). A dispute falls into that category, and a case based on\nthat dispute remains live, if “(1) the challenged action [is] in\nits duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation\nor expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the\nsame complaining party [will] be subjected to the same action\nagain.” Weinstein v. Bradford , 423 U. S. 147 , 149\n(1975) (per curiam). Our precedent makes clear that the “challenged\naction,” Turner’s imprisonment for up to 12 months, is “in its\nduration too short to be fully litigated” through the state courts\n(and arrive here) prior to its “expiration.” See, e.g. , First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti , 435 U. S. 765 , 774\n(1978) (internal quotation marks omitted) (18-month period too\nshort); Southern Pacific Terminal Co. , supra , at\n514–516 (2-year period too short). At the same time, there is a\nmore than “reasonable” likelihood that Turner will again be\n“subjected to the same action.” As we have pointed out, supra , at 2–3, Turner has frequently failed to make his\nchild support payments. He has been the subject of several civil\ncontempt proceedings. He has been imprisoned on several of those\noccasions. Within months of his release from the imprisonment here\nat issue he was again the subject of civil contempt proceedings.\nAnd he was again imprisoned, this time for six months. As of\nDecember 9, 2010, Turner was $13,814.72 in arrears, and another\ncontempt hearing was scheduled for May 4, 2011. App. 104a; Reply\nBrief for Petitioner 3, n. 1. These facts bring this case\nsquarely within the special category of cases that are not moot\nbecause the underlying dispute is “capable of repetition, yet\nevading review.” See, e.g. , Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart , 427 U. S. 539 , 546–547\n(1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the underlying facts make this case\nunlike DeFunis v. Odegaard , 416 U. S. 312 (1974) (per curiam) , and St. Pierre v. United\nStates , 319 U.\nS. 41 (1943) (per curiam) , two cases that respondents\nbelieve require us to find this case moot regardless. DeFunis was moot, but that is because the plaintiff\nhimself was unlikely to again suffer the conduct of which he\ncomplained (and others likely to suffer from that conduct could\nbring their own lawsuits). Here petitioner himself is likely to suffer future imprisonment. St. Pierre was moot because the\npetitioner (a witness held in contempt and sentenced to five\nmonths’ imprisonment) had failed to “apply to this Court for a\nstay” of the federal-court order imposing imprisonment. 319 U. S.,\nat 42–43. And, like the witness in St. Pierre, Turner did\nnot seek a stay of the contempt order requiring his imprisonment.\nBut this case, unlike St. Pierre, arises out of a\nstate-court proceeding. And respondents give us no reason to\nbelieve that we would have (or that we could have) granted a timely\nrequest for a stay had one been made. Cf. 28 U. S. C. §1257\n(granting this Court jurisdiction to review final state-court judgments). In Sibron , we rejected a similar\n“mootness” argument for just that reason. 392 U. S., at 53,\nn. 13. And we find this case similar in this respect to Sibron, not to St. Pierre . III A We must decide whether the Due\nProcess Clause grants an indigent defendant, such as Turner, a\nright to state-appointed counsel at a civil contempt proceeding,\nwhich may lead to his incarceration. This Court’s precedents\nprovide no definitive answer to that question. This Court has long\nheld that the Sixth Amendment grants an indigent defendant the\nright to state-appointed counsel in a criminal case. Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U. S. 335 (1963).\nAnd we have held that this same rule applies to criminal\ncontempt proceedings (other than summary proceedings). United States v. Dixon , 509 U. S. 688 , 696\n(1993); Cooke v. United States , 267 U. S. 517 , 537\n(1925). But the Sixth Amendment does not\ngovern civil cases. Civil contempt differs from criminal contempt\nin that it seeks only to “coerc[e] the defendant to do” what a\ncourt had previously ordered him to do. Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co. , 221 U. S. 418 , 442\n(1911). A court may not impose punishment “in a civil contempt\nproceeding when it is clearly established that the alleged\ncontemnor is unable to comply with the terms of the order.” Hicks v. Feiock , 485 U. S. 624 , 638,\nn. 9 (1988). And once a civil contemnor complies with the\nunderlying order, he is purged of the contempt and is free. Id. , at 633 (he “carr[ies] the keys of [his] prison in\n[his] own pockets” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Consequently, the Court has made clear (in a\ncase not involving the right to counsel) that, where civil contempt\nis at issue, the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause allows a\nState to provide fewer procedural protections than in a criminal\ncase. Id. , at 637–641 (State may place the burden of\nproving inability to pay on the defendant). This Court has decided only a handful of cases\nthat more directly concern a right to counsel in civil matters. And\nthe application of those decisions to the present case is not\nclear. On the one hand, the Court has held that the Fourteenth\nAmendment requires the State to pay for representation by counsel\nin a civil “juvenile delinquency” proceeding (which could\nlead to incarceration). In re Gault , 387 U. S. 1 , 35–42 (1967).\nMoreover, in Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480 , 496–497\n(1980), a plurality of four Members of this Court would have held\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment requires representation by counsel in\na proceeding to transfer a prison inmate to a state hospital for\nthe mentally ill. Further, in Lassiter v. Department\nof Social Servs. of Durham Cty. , 452 U. S. 18 (1981), a\ncase that focused upon civil proceedings leading to loss of\nparental rights, the Court wrote that the “pre-eminent generalization that emerges from this\nCourt’s precedents on an indigent’s right to appointed counsel is\nthat such a right has been recognized to exist only where the\nlitigant may lose his physical liberty if he loses the litigation.” Id. , at 25. And the Court then drew from these precedents “the\npresumption that an indigent litigant has a right to appointed\ncounsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his physical\nliberty.” Id. , at 26–27. On the other hand, the Court has held that a\ncriminal offender facing revocation of probation and imprisonment\ndoes not ordinarily have a right to counsel at a probation\nrevocation hearing. Gagnon v. Scarpelli , 411 U. S. 778 (1973); see also Middendorf v. Henry , 425 U. S. 25 (1976) (no\ndue process right to counsel in summary court-martial proceedings).\nAnd, at the same time, Gault, Vitek, and Lassiter are readily distinguishable. The civil juvenile delinquency\nproceeding at issue in Gault was “little different” from,\nand “comparable in seriousness” to, a criminal prosecution. 387 U.\nS., at 28, 36. In Vitek, the controlling opinion found no right to counsel. 445 U. S., at 499–500 (Powell, J.,\nconcurring in part) (assistance of mental health professionals\nsufficient). And the Court’s statements in Lassiter constitute part of its rationale for denying a right to\ncounsel in that case. We believe those statements are best read as\npointing out that the Court previously had found a right to counsel\n“ only ” in cases involving incarceration, not that a right\nto counsel exists in all such cases (a position that would\nhave been difficult to reconcile with Gagnon ). B Civil contempt proceedings in\nchild support cases con- stitute one part of a highly complex\nsystem designed to assure a noncustodial parent’s regular payment\nof funds typically necessary for the support of his children. Often\nthe family receives welfare support from a state-administered\nfederal program, and the State then seeks reimbursement from the\nnoncustodial parent. See 42 U. S. C. §§608(a)(3) (2006 ed.,\nSupp. III), 656(a)(1) (2006 ed.); S. C. Code Ann.\n§§43–5–65(a)(1), (2) (2010 Cum. Supp.). Other times the custodial\nparent (often the mother, but sometimes the father, a grandparent,\nor another person with custody) does not receive government\nbenefits and is entitled to receive the support payments\nherself. The Federal Government has\ncreated an elaborate procedural mechanism designed to help both the\ngovernment and custodial parents to secure the payments to which\nthey are entitled. See generally Blessing v. Freestone , 520 U. S. 329 , 333\n(1997) (describing the “interlocking set of cooperative\nfederal-state welfare programs” as they relate to child support\nenforcement); 45 CFR pt. 303 (2010) (prescribing standards for\nstate child support agencies). These systems often rely upon wage\nwithholding, expedited procedures for modifying and enforcing child\nsupport orders, and automated data processing. 42 U. S. C.\n§§666(a), (b), 654(24). But sometimes States will use contempt\norders to ensure that the custodial parent receives support\npayments or the government receives reimbursement. Although some\nexperts have criticized this last-mentioned procedure, and the\nFederal Government believes that “the routine use of contempt for\nnon-payment of child support is likely to be an ineffective\nstrategy,” the Government also tells us that “coercive enforcement\nremedies, such as contempt, have a role to play.” Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 21–22, and n. 8 (citing Dept.\nof Health and Human Services, National Child Support Enforcement,\nStrategic Plan: FY 2005–2009, pp. 2, 10). South Carolina, which\nrelies heavily on contempt proceedings, agrees that they are an\nimportant tool. We here consider an indigent’s right to paid\ncounsel at such a contempt proceeding. It is a civil proceeding.\nAnd we consequently determine the “specific dictates of due\nprocess” by examining the “distinct factors” that this Court has\npreviously found useful in deciding what specific safeguards the\nConstitution’s Due Process Clause re-quires in order to make a\ncivil proceeding fundamentally fair. Mathews v. Eldridge , 424 U. S. 319 , 335\n(1976) (considering fairness of an administrative proceeding). As\nrelevant here those factors include (1) the nature of “the private\ninterest that will be affected,” (2) the comparative “risk” of an\n“erroneous deprivation” of that interest with and without\n“additional or substitute procedural safeguards,” and (3) the\nnature and magnitude of any countervailing interest in not\nproviding “additional or substitute procedural requirement[s].” Ibid. See also Lassiter , 452 U. S., at 27–31\n(applying the Mathews framework). The “private interest that will be affected”\nargues strongly for the right to counsel that Turner advocates.\nThat interest consists of an indigent defendant’s loss of personal\nliberty through imprisonment. The interest in securing that\nfreedom, the freedom “from bodily restraint,” lies “at the core of\nthe liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.” Foucha v. Louisiana , 504 U. S. 71 , 80 (1992).\nAnd we have made clear that its threatened loss through legal\nproceedings demands “due process protection.” Addington v. Texas , 441\nU. S. 418 , 425 (1979). Given the importance of the interest at stake,\nit is ob-viously important to assure accurate decisionmaking in\nrespect to the key “ability to pay” question. Moreover, the fact\nthat ability to comply marks a dividing line between civil and\ncriminal contempt, Hicks , 485 U. S., at 635, n. 7,\nreinforces the need for accuracy. That is because an incorrect\ndecision (wrongly classifying the contempt proceeding as civil) can\nincrease the risk of wrongful incarceration by depriving the\ndefendant of the procedural protections (including counsel) that\nthe Constitution would demand in a criminal proceeding. See, e.g. , Dixon , 509 U. S., at 696 (proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt, protection from double jeopardy); Codispoti v. Pennsylvania , 418 U. S. 506 , 512–513,\n517 (1974) (jury trial where the result is more than six months’\nimprisonment). And since 70% of child support arrears nationwide\nare owed by parents with either no reported income or income of\n$10,000 per year or less, the issue of ability to pay may arise\nfairly often. See E. Sorensen, L. Sousa, & S. Schaner,\nAssessing Child Support Arrears in Nine Large States and the Nation\n22 (2007) (prepared by The Urban Institute), online at\nhttp://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/07/assessing-CS-debt/report.pdf (as visited\nJune 16, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file); id. , at 23 (“research suggests that many obligors who do\nnot have reported quarterly wages have relatively limited\nresources”); Patterson, Civil Contempt and the Indigent Child\nSupport Obligor: The Silent Return of Debtor’s Prison, 18 Cornell\nJ. L. & Pub. Pol’y 95, 117 (2008). See also, e.g. , McBride v. McBride , 334 N. C.\n124, 131, n. 4, 431 S. E. 2d 14, 19, n. 4 (1993)\n(surveying North Carolina contempt orders and finding that the\n“failure of trial courts to make a determination of a contemnor’s\nability to comply is not altogether infrequent”). On the other hand, the Due Process Clause does\nnot always require the provision of counsel in civil proceedings\nwhere incarceration is threatened. See Gagnon , 411 U. S. 778 . And in determining\nwhether the Clause requires a right to counsel here, we must take\naccount of opposing interests, as well as consider the probable\nvalue of “additional or substitute procedural safeguards.” Mathews , supra , at 335. Doing so, we find three related considerations\nthat, when taken together, argue strongly against the Due Process\nClause requiring the State to provide indigents with counsel in\nevery proceeding of the kind before us. First, the critical question likely at issue\nin these cases concerns, as we have said, the defendant’s ability\nto pay. That question is often closely related to the question of\nthe defendant’s indigence. But when the right procedures are in\nplace, indigence can be a question that in many—but not all—cases\nis sufficiently straightforward to warrant determination prior to providing a defendant with counsel, even in a\ncriminal case. Federal law, for example, requires a criminal\ndefendant to provide information showing that he is indigent, and\ntherefore entitled to state-funded counsel, before he can\nreceive that assistance. See 18 U. S. C. §3006A(b). Second, sometimes, as here, the person\nopposing the defendant at the hearing is not the government\nrepresented by counsel but the custodial parent un repr",

CONCEPCION et\nux. certiorari to the united states court of appeals\nfor the ninth circuit No. 09–893. Argued November 9, 2010—Decided April\n27, 2011 The cellular telephone contract between respondents\n(Concepcions) and petitioner (AT&T) provided for arbitration of\nall disputes, but did not permit classwide arbitration. After the\nConcepcions were charged sales tax on the retail value of phones\nprovided free under their service contract, they sued AT&T in a\nCalifornia Federal District Court. Their suit was consolidated with\na class action alleging, inter alia , that AT&T had\nengaged in false advertising and fraud by charging sales tax on\n“free” phones. The District Court denied AT&T’s motion to\ncompel arbitration under the Concepcions’ contract. Relying on the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s Discover Bank decision, it\nfound the arbitration provision unconscionable because it\ndisallowed classwide proceedings. The Ninth Circuit agreed that the\nprovision was unconscionable under California law and held that the\nFederal Arbitration Act (FAA), which makes arbitration agreements\n“valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as\nexist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,” 9 U.\nS. C. §2, did not preempt its ruling. Held: Because it “stands as an\nobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes\nand objectives of Congress,” Hines v. Davidowitz , 312 U. S. 52 , 67,\nCalifornia’s Discover Bank rule is pre-empted by the FAA.\nPp. 4–18. (a) Section 2 reflects a\n“liberal federal policy favoring arbitration,” Moses H. Cone\nMemorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp. , 460 U. S. 1 , 24, and the\n“fundamental principle that arbitration is a matter of contract,” Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson , 561 U. S.\n____, ____. Thus, courts must place arbitration agreements on an\nequal footing with other contracts, Buckeye Check Cashing,\nInc. v. Cardegna , 546 U. S. 440 , 443, and\nenforce them according to their terms, Volt Information\nSciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford\nJunior Univ. , 489 U. S. 468 , 478.\nSection 2’s saving clause permits agreements to be invalidated by\n“generally applicable contract defenses,” but not by defenses that\napply only to arbitration or derive their meaning from the fact\nthat an agreement to arbitrate is at issue. Doctor’s\nAssociates , Inc. v. Casarotto , 517 U. S. 681 , 687.\nPp. 4–5. (b) In Discover Bank , the\nCalifornia Supreme Court held that class waivers in consumer\narbitration agreements are unconscionable if the agreement is in an\nadhesion contract, disputes between the parties are likely to\ninvolve small amounts of damages, and the party with inferior\nbargaining power alleges a deliberate scheme to defraud.\nPp. 5–6. (c) The Concepcions claim that the Discover Bank rule is a ground that “exist[s] at law or in\nequity for the revocation of any contract” under FAA §2. When state\nlaw prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of\nclaim, the FAA displaces the conflicting rule. But the inquiry is\nmore complex when a generally applicable doctrine is alleged to\nhave been applied in a fashion that disfavors or interferes with\narbitration. Although §2’s saving clause preserves generally\napplicable contract defenses, it does not suggest an intent to\npreserve state-law rules that stand as an obstacle to the\naccomplishment of the FAA’s objectives. Cf. Geier v. American Honda Motor Co. , 529 U. S. 861 , 872. The\nFAA’s overarching purpose is to ensure the enforcement of\narbitration agreements according to their terms so as to facilitate\ninformal, streamlined proceedings. Parties may agree to limit the\nissues subject to arbitration, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc. , 473 U. S. 614 , 628, to\narbitrate according to specific rules, Volt , supra, at 479, and to limit with whom they will arbitrate, Stolt-Nielsen , supra, at ___. Pp. 6–12. (d) Class arbitration, to the extent it\nis manufactured by Discover Bank rather than consensual,\ninterferes with fundamental attributes of arbitration. The switch\nfrom bilateral to class arbitration sacrifices arbitration’s\ninformality and makes the process slower, more costly, and more\nlikely to generate procedural morass than final judgment. And class\narbitration greatly increases risks to defendants. The absence of\nmultilayered review makes it more likely that errors will go\nuncorrected. That risk of error may become unacceptable when\ndamages allegedly owed to thousands of claimants are aggregated and\ndecided at once. Arbitration is poorly suited to these higher\nstakes. In litigation, a defendant may appeal a certification\ndecision and a final judgment, but 9 U. S. C. §10 limits the\ngrounds on which courts can vacate arbitral awards.\nPp. 12–18. 584 F. 3d 849, reversed and remanded. Scalia, J., delivered the opinion\nof the Court, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Thomas,\nand Alito, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nBreyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. OPINION OF THE COURT AT&T MOBILITY LLC V. CONCEPCION 563 U. S. ____ (2011) SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NO. 09-893 AT&T MOBILITY LLC, PETITIONER v. VINCENT CONCEPCION et ux. on writ of certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit [April 27, 2011] Justice Scalia delivered the\nopinion of the Court. Section 2 of the Federal\nArbitration Act (FAA) makes agreements to arbitrate “valid,\nirrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at\nlaw or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” 9 U.\nS. C. §2. We consider whether the FAA prohibits States from\nconditioning the enforceability of certain arbitration agreements\non the availability of classwide arbitration procedures. I In February 2002, Vincent and\nLiza Concepcion entered into an agreement for the sale and\nservicing of cellular telephones with AT&T Mobility LCC\n(AT&T).[ Footnote 1 ] The\ncontract provided for arbitration of all disputes between the\nparties, but required that claims be brought in the parties’\n“individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any\npurported class or representative proceeding.” App. to Pet. for\nCert 61a.[ Footnote 2 ] The\nagreement authorized AT&T to make unilateral amendments, which\nit did to the arbitration provision on several occasions. The\nversion at issue in this case reflects revisions made in December\n2006, which the parties agree are controlling. The revised agreement provides\nthat customers may initiate dispute proceedings by completing a\none-page No-tice of Dispute form available on AT&T’s Web site.\nAT&T may then offer to settle the claim; if it does not, or if\nthe dispute is not resolved within 30 days, the customer may invoke\narbitration by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, also\navailable on AT&T’s Web site. In the event the parties proceed\nto arbitration, the agreement specifies that AT&T must pay all\ncosts for nonfrivolous claims; that arbitration must take place in\nthe county in which the customer is billed; that, for claims of\n$10,000 or less, the customer may choose whether the arbitration\nproceeds in person, by telephone, or based only on submissions;\nthat either party may bring a claim in small claims court in lieu\nof arbitration; and that the arbitrator may award any form of\nindividual relief, including injunctions and presumably punitive\ndamages. The agreement, moreover, denies AT&T any ability to\nseek reimbursement of its attorney’s fees, and, in the event that a\ncustomer receives an arbitration award greater than AT&T’s last\nwritten settlement offer, requires AT&T to pay a $7,500 minimum\nrecovery and twice the amount of the claimant’s attorney’s\nfees.[ Footnote 3 ] The Concepcions purchased AT&T service,\nwhich was advertised as including the provision of free phones;\nthey were not charged for the phones, but they were charged $30.22\nin sales tax based on the phones’ retail value. In March 2006, the\nConcepcions filed a complaint against AT&T in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of California. The\ncomplaint was later consolidated with a putative class action\nalleging, among other things, that AT&T had engaged in false\nadvertising and fraud by charging sales tax on phones it advertised\nas free. In March 2008, AT&T moved to compel\narbitration under the terms of its contract with the Concepcions.\nThe Concepcions opposed the motion, contending that the\nar-bitration agreement was unconscionable and unlawfully\nexculpatory under California law because it disallowed classwide\nprocedures. The District Court denied AT&T’s motion. It\ndescribed AT&T’s arbitration agreement favorably, noting, for\nexample, that the informal dispute-resolution process was “quick,\neasy to use” and likely to “promp[t] full or … even excess payment\nto the customer without the need to arbitrate or\nlitigate”; that the $7,500 premium functioned as “a substantial\ninducement for the consumer to pursue the claim in arbitration” if\na dispute was not resolved informally; and that consumers who were\nmembers of a class would likely be worse off. Laster v. T-Mobile USA, Inc. , 2008 WL 5216255, *11–*12 (SD Cal.,\nAug. 11, 2008). Nevertheless, relying on the California Supreme\nCourt’s decision in Discover Bank v. Superior\nCourt , 36 Cal. 4th 148, 113 P. 3d 1100 (2005), the court\nfound that the arbitration provision was unconscionable because\nAT&T had not shown that bilateral arbitration adequately\nsubstituted for the deterrent effects of class actions. Laster , 2008 WL 5216255, *14. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, also finding the\nprovision unconscionable under California law as announced in Discover Bank . Laster v. AT&T Mobility\nLLC , 584 F. 3d 849, 855 (2009). It also held that the Discover Bank rule was not preempted by the FAA because\nthat rule was simply “a refinement of the unconscionability\nanalysis applicable to contracts generally in California.” 584\nF. 3d, at 857. In response to AT&T’s argument that the\nCon-cepcions’ interpretation of California law discriminated\nagainst arbitration, the Ninth Circuit rejected the contention that\n“ ‘class proceedings will reduce the efficiency and\nexpeditiousness of arbitration’ ” and noted that\n“ ‘ Discover Bank placed arbitration\nagreements with class action waivers on the exact same\nfooting as contracts that bar class action litigation outside\nthe context of arbitration.’ ” Id ., at 858 (quoting Shroyer v. New Cingular Wireless Services, Inc .,\n498 F. 3d 976, 990 (CA9 2007)). We granted certiorari, 560 U. S. ___\n(2010). II The FAA was enacted in 1925 in\nresponse to widespread judicial hostility to arbitration\nagreements. See Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v. Mattel, Inc. , 552 U. S. 576 , 581\n(2008). Section 2, the “primary substantive provision of the Act,” Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr.\nCorp. , 460 U. S.\n1 , 24 (1983), provides, in relevant part, as follows: “A written provision in any\nmaritime transaction or a contract evidencing a transaction\ninvolving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy\nthereafter arising out of such contract or transaction … shall be\nvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as\nexist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” 9 U.\nS. C. §2. We have described this provision as reflecting both\na “liberal federal policy favoring arbitration,” Moses H.\nCone , supra, at 24, and the “fundamental principle\nthat arbitration is a matter of contract,” Rent-A-Center, West,\nInc. v. Jackson , 561 U. S. ____ , ____ (2010) (slip\nop., at 3). In line with these principles, courts must place\narbitration agreements on an equal footing with other contracts, Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna , 546 U. S. 440 , 443\n(2006), and enforce them according to their terms, Volt\nInformation Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland\nStanford Junior Univ. , 489 U. S. 468 , 478\n(1989). The final phrase of §2, however, permits\narbitration agreements to be declared unenforceable “upon such\ngrounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any\ncontract.” This saving clause permits agreements to arbitrate to be\ninvalidated by “generally applicable contract defenses, such as\nfraud, duress, or unconscionability,” but not by defenses that\napply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the\nfact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue. Doctor’s\nAssociates , Inc. v. Casarotto , 517 U. S. 681 , 687\n(1996); see also Perry v. Thomas , 482 U. S. 483 , 492–493, n. 9\n(1987). The question in this case is whether §2 preempts\nCalifornia’s rule classifying most collective-arbitration waivers\nin consumer contracts as unconscionable. We refer to this rule as\nthe Discover Bank rule. Under California law, courts may refuse to\nenforce any contract found “to have been unconscionable at the time\nit was made,” or may “limit the application of any unconscionable\nclause.” Cal. Civ. Code Ann. §1670.5(a) (West 1985). A finding of\nunconscionability requires “a ‘procedural’ and a ‘substantive’\nelement, the former focusing on ‘oppression’ or ‘surprise’ due to\nunequal bargaining power, the latter on ‘overly harsh’ or\n‘one-sided’ results.” Armendariz v. Foundation Health\nPyschcare Servs., Inc. , 24 Cal. 4th 83, 114, 6 P. 3d 669,\n690 (2000); accord, Discover Bank , 36 Cal. 4th, at\n159–161, 113 P. 3d, at 1108. In Discover Bank , the California\nSupreme Court applied this framework to class-action waivers in\narbitration agreements and held as follows: “[W]hen the waiver is found in a consumer contract\nof adhesion in a setting in which disputes between the contracting\nparties predictably involve small amounts of damages, and when it\nis alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has\ncarried out a scheme to deliberately cheat large numbers of\nconsumers out of individually small sums of money, then … the\nwaiver becomes in practice the exemption of the party ‘from\nresponsibility for [its] own fraud, or willful injury to the person\nor property of another.’ Under these circumstances, such waivers\nare unconscionable under California law and should not be\nenforced.” Id. , at 162, 113 P. 3d, at 1110 (quoting\nCal. Civ. Code Ann. §1668). California courts have frequently applied this rule\nto find arbitration agreements unconscionable. See, e.g. , Cohen v. DirecTV, Inc ., 142 Cal. App. 4th 1442,\n1451–1453, 48 Cal. Rptr. 3d 813, 819–821 (2006); Klussman v. Cross Country Bank , 134 Cal. App. 4th 1283, 1297, 36\nCal Rptr. 3d 728, 738–739 (2005); Aral v. EarthLink,\nInc ., 134 Cal. App. 4th 544, 556–557, 36 Cal. Rptr. 3d 229,\n237–239 (2005). III A The Concepcions argue that the Discover Bank rule, given its origins in California’s\nunconscionability doctrine and California’s policy against\nexculpation, is a ground that “exist[s] at law or in equity for the\nrevocation of any contract” under FAA §2. Moreover, they argue that\neven if we construe the Discover Bank rule as a\nprohibition on collective-action waivers rather than simply an\napplication of unconscionability, the rule would still be\napplicable to all dispute-resolution contracts, since California\nprohibits waivers of class litigation as well. See America\nOnline, Inc. v. Superior Ct. , 90 Cal. App. 4th 1,\n17–18, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 699, 711–713 (2001). When state law prohibits outright\nthe arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is\nstraightforward: The conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA. Preston v. Ferrer , 552 U. S. 346 , 353\n(2008). But the inquiry becomes more complex when a doctrine\nnormally thought to be generally applicable, such as duress or, as\nrelevant here, unconscionability, is alleged to have been applied\nin a fashion that disfavors arbitration. In Perry v. Thomas , 482 U. S. 483 (1987), for example, we\nnoted that the FAA’s preemptive effect might extend even to grounds\ntraditionally thought to exist “ ‘at law or in equity for the\nrevocation of any contract.’ ” Id. , at 492, n. 9\n(emphasis deleted). We said that a court may not “rely on the\nuniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate as a basis for a state-law\nholding that enforcement would be unconscionable, for this would\nenable the court to effect what … the state legislature cannot.” Id. , at 493, n. 9. An obvious illustration of this point would be\na case finding unconscionable or unenforceable as against public\npolicy consumer arbitration agreements that fail to provide for\njudicially monitored discovery. The rationalizations for such a\nholding are neither difficult to imagine nor different in kind from\nthose articulated in Discover Bank. A court might reason\nthat no consumer would knowingly waive his right to full discovery,\nas this would enable companies to hide their wrongdoing. Or the\ncourt might simply say that such agreements are\nexculpatory—re-stricting discovery would be of greater benefit to\nthe company than the consumer, since the former is more likely to\nbe sued than to sue. See Discover Bank , supra , at\n161, 113 P. 3d, at 1109 (arguing that class waivers are\nsimilarly one-sided). And, the reasoning would continue, because\nsuch a rule applies the general principle of unconscionability or\npublic-policy disapproval of exculpatory agreements, it is\napplicable to “any” contract and thus preserved by §2 of the FAA.\nIn practice, of course, the rule would have a disproportionate\nimpact on arbitration agreements; but it would presumably apply to\ncontracts purporting to restrict discovery in litigation as\nwell. Other examples are easy to imagine. The same\nargument might apply to a rule classifying as unconscionable\narbitration agreements that fail to abide by the Federal Rules of\nEvidence, or that disallow an ultimate disposition by a jury\n(perhaps termed “a panel of twelve lay arbitrators” to help avoid\npreemption). Such examples are not fanciful, since the judicial\nhostility towards arbitration that prompted the FAA had manifested\nitself in “a great variety” of “devices and formulas” declaring\narbitration against public policy. Robert Lawrence Co. v. Devonshire Fabrics, Inc. , 271 F. 2d 402, 406 (CA2\n1959). And although these statistics are not definitive, it is\nworth noting that California’s courts have been more likely to hold\ncontracts to arbitrate unconscionable than other contracts. Broome,\nAn Unconscionable Applicable of the Unconscionability Doctrine: How\nthe California Courts are Circumventing the Federal Arbitration\nAct, 3 Hastings Bus. L. J. 39, 54, 66 (2006); Randall,\nJudicial Attitudes Toward Arbitration and the Resurgence of\nUnconscionability, 52 Buffalo L. Rev. 185, 186–187 (2004). The Concepcions suggest that all this is just\na parade of horribles, and no genuine worry. “Rules aimed at\ndestroying arbitration” or “demanding procedures incompatible with\narbitration,” they concede, “would be preempted by the FAA because\nthey cannot sensibly be reconciled with Section 2.” Brief for\nRespondents 32. The “grounds” available under §2’s saving clause,\nthey admit, “should not be construed to include a State’s mere\npreference for procedures that are incompatible with arbitration\nand ‘would wholly eviscerate arbitration agreements.’ ” Id. , at 33 (quoting Carter v. SSC Odin\nOperating Co., LLC , 237 Ill. 2d 30, 50, 927 N. E. 2d\n1207, 1220 (2010)).[ Footnote\n4 ] We largely agree. Although §2’s saving clause\npreserves generally applicable contract defenses, nothing in it\nsuggests an intent to preserve state-law rules that stand as an\nobstacle to the accomplishment of the FAA’s objectives. Cf. Geier v. American Honda Motor Co. , 529 U. S. 861 , 872\n(2000); Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council , 530 U. S. 363 ,\n372–373 (2000). As we have said, a federal statute’s saving clause\n“ ‘cannot in reason be construed as [allowing] a common law\nright, the continued existence of which would be absolutely\ninconsistent with the provisions of the act. In other words, the\nact cannot be held to destroy itself.’ ” American\nTelephone & Telegraph Co. v. Central Office Telephone,\nInc. , 524 U. S.\n214 , 227–228 (1998) (quoting Texas & Pacific R.\nCo. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co. , 204 U. S. 426 , 446\n(1907)). We differ with the Concepcions only in the\napplication of this analysis to the matter before us. We do not\nagree that rules requiring judicially monitored discovery or\nadherence to the Federal Rules of Evidence are “a far cry from this\ncase.” Brief for Respondents 32. The overarching purpose of the\nFAA, evident in the text of §§2, 3, and 4, is to ensure the\nenforcement of arbitration agreements according to their terms so\nas to facilitate streamlined proceedings. Requiring the\navailability of classwide arbitration interferes with fundamental\nattributes of arbitration and thus creates a scheme inconsistent\nwith the FAA. B The “principal\npurpose” of the FAA is to “ensur[e] that private arbitration\nagreements are enforced according to their terms.” Volt ,\n489 U. S., at 478; see also Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int’l Corp. , 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip\nop., at 17). This purpose is readily apparent from the FAA’s text.\nSection 2 makes arbitration agreements “valid, irrevocable, and\nenforceable” as written (subject, of course, to the saving clause);\n§3 requires courts to stay litigation of arbitral claims pending\narbitration of those claims “in accordance with the terms of the\nagreement”; and §4 requires courts to compel arbitration “in\naccordance with the terms of the agreement” upon the motion of\neither party to the agreement (assuming that the “making of the\narbitration agreement or the failure … to perform the same” is not\nat issue). In light of these provisions, we have held that parties\nmay agree to limit the issues subject to arbitration, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth,\nInc. , 473 U. S.\n614 , 628 (1985), to arbitrate according to specific rules, Volt , supra, at 479, and to limit with\nwhom a party will arbitrate its disputes, Stolt-Nielsen , supra, at ___ (slip op., at\n19). The point of\naffording parties discretion in designing arbitration processes is\nto allow for efficient, streamlined procedures tailored to the type\nof dispute. It can be specified, for example, that the\ndecisionmaker be a specialist in the relevant field, or that\nproceedings be kept confidential to protect trade secrets. And the\ninformality of arbitral proceedings is itself desirable, reducing\nthe cost and increasing the speed of dispute resolution. 14\nPenn Plaza LLC v. Pyett , 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009)\n(slip op., at 20); Mitsubishi Motors Corp. , supra, at 628. The dissent quotes Dean Witter\nReynolds Inc. v. Byrd , 470 U. S. 213 , 219\n(1985), as “ ‘reject[ing] the suggestion that the overriding\ngoal of the Arbitration Act was to promote the expeditious\nresolution of claims.’ ” Post , at 4 (opinion of\nBreyer, J.). That is greatly misleading. After saying (accurately\nenough) that “the overriding goal of the Arbitration Act was [not]\nto promote the expeditious resolution of claims,” but to “ensure\njudicial enforcement of privately made agreements to arbitrate,”\n470 U. S., at 219, Dean Witter went on to explain: “This\nis not to say that Congress was blind to the potential benefit of\nthe legislation for expedited resolution of disputes. Far from it\n… .” Id. , at 220. It then quotes a House Report\nsaying that “the costliness and delays of litigation … can be\nlargely eliminated by agreements for arbitration.” Ibid. (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 96, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1924)).\nThe concluding paragraph of this part of its discussion begins as\nfollows: “We therefore are not\npersuaded by the argument that the conflict between two goals of\nthe Arbitration Act—enforcement of private agreements and\nencouragement of efficient and speedy dispute resolution—must be\nresolved in favor of the latter in order to realize the intent of\nthe drafters.” 470 U. S., at 221. In the present case, of course, those\n“two goals” do not conflict—and it is the dissent’s view that would\nfrustrate both of them. Contrary to the dissent’s view,\nour cases place it beyond dispute that the FAA was designed to\npromote arbitration. They have repeatedly described the Act as\n“embod[ying] [a] national policy favoring arbitration,” Buckeye\nCheck Cashing , 546 U. S., at 443, and “a liberal federal\npolicy favoring arbitration agreements, notwithstanding any state\nsubstantive or procedural policies to the contrary,” Moses H.\nCone , 460 U. S., at 24; see also Hall Street Assocs. ,\n552 U. S., at 581. Thus, in Preston v. Ferrer ,\nholding preempted a state-law rule requiring exhaustion of\nadministrative remedies before arbitration, we said: “A prime\nobjective of an agreement to arbitrate is to achieve ‘streamlined\nproceedings and expeditious results,’ ” which objective would\nbe “frustrated” by requiring a dispute to be heard by an agency\nfirst. 552 U. S., at 357–358. That rule, we said, would “at the\nleast, hinder speedy resolution of the controversy.” Id. ,\nat 358.[ Footnote 5 ] California’s Discover\nBank rule similarly interferes with arbitration. Although the\nrule does not require classwide arbitration, it allows any\nparty to a consumer contract to demand it ex post. The\nrule is limited to adhesion contracts, Discover Bank , 36\nCal. 4th, at 162–163, 113 P. 3d, at 1110, but the times in\nwhich consumer contracts were anything other than adhesive are long\npast.[ Footnote 6 ] Carbajal v. H&R Block Tax Servs., Inc ., 372\nF. 3d 903, 906 (CA7 2004); see also Hill v. Gateway 2000, Inc. , 105 F. 3d 1147, 1149 (CA7 1997).\nThe rule also requires that damages be predictably small, and that\nthe consumer allege a scheme to cheat consumers. Discover\nBank , supra, at 162–163, 113 P. 3d, at 1110. The\nformer requirement, however, is toothless and malleable (the Ninth\nCircuit has held that damages of $4,000 are sufficiently small, see Oestreicher v. Alienware Corp. , 322 Fed. Appx.\n489, 492 (2009) (unpublished)), and the latter has no limiting\neffect, as all that is required is an allegation. Consumers remain\nfree to bring and resolve their disputes on a bilateral basis under Discover Bank , and some may well do so; but there is\nlittle incentive for lawyers to arbitrate on behalf of individuals\nwhen they may do so for a class and reap far higher fees in the\nprocess. And faced with inevitable class arbitration, companies\nwould have less incentive to continue resolving potentially\nduplicative claims on an individual basis. Although we have had little\noccasion to examine classwide arbitration, our decision in Stolt-Nielsen is instructive. In that case we held that an\narbitration panel exceeded its power under §10(a)(4) of the FAA by\nimposing class procedures based on policy judgments rather than the\narbitration agreement itself or some background principle of\ncontract law that would affect its interpretation. 559 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 20–23). We then held that the agreement at issue,\nwhich was silent on the question of class procedures, could not be\ninterpreted to allow them because the “changes brought about by the\nshift from bilateral arbitration to class-action arbitration” are\n“fundamental.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 22). This is\nobvious as a structural matter: Classwide arbitration includes\nabsent parties, necessitating additional and different procedures\nand involving higher stakes. Confidentiality becomes more\ndifficult. And while it is theoretically possible to select an\narbitrator with some expertise relevant to the class-certification\nquestion, arbitrators are not generally knowledgeable in the\noften-dominant procedural aspects of certification, such as the\nprotection of absent parties. The conclusion follows that class\narbitration, to the extent it is manufactured by Discover\nBank rather than consensual, is inconsistent with the\nFAA. First, the switch from bilateral\nto class arbitration sacrifices the principal advantage of\narbitration—its informality—and makes the process slower, more\ncostly, and more likely to generate procedural morass than final\njudgment. “In bilateral arbitration, parties forgo the procedural\nrigor and appellate review of the courts in order to realize the\nbenefits of private dispute resolution: lower costs, greater\nefficiency and speed, and the ability to choose expert adjudicators\nto resolve specialized disputes.” 559 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n21). But before an arbitrator may decide the merits of a claim in\nclasswide procedures, he must first decide, for example, whether\nthe class itself may be certified, whether the named parties are\nsufficiently representative and typical, and how discovery for the\nclass should be conducted. A cursory comparison of bilateral and\nclass arbitration illustrates the difference. According to the\nAmerican Arbitration Association (AAA), the average consumer\narbitration between January and August 2007 resulted in a\ndisposition on the merits in six months, four months if the\narbitration was conducted by documents only. AAA, Analysis of the\nAAA’s Con-sumer Arbitration Caseload, online at http://www.adr.org/\nsi.asp?id=5027 (all Internet materials as visited Apr. 25, 2011,\nand available in Clerk of Court’s case file). As of September 2009,\nthe AAA had opened 283 class arbitrations. Of those, 121 remained\nactive, and 162 had been settled, withdrawn, or dismissed. Not a\nsingle one, however, had resulted in a final award on the merits.\nBrief for AAA as Amicus Curiae in Stolt-Nielsen, O. T. 2009, No. 08–1198, pp. 22–24. For those cases that were\nno longer active, the median time from filing to settlement,\nwithdrawal, or dismissal—not judgment on the merits—was 583 days,\nand the mean was 630 days. Id. , at 24.[ Footnote 7 ] Second, class arbitration requires procedural formality. The AAA’s rules governing\nclass arbitrations mimic the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for\nclass litigation. Compare AAA, Supplementary Rules for Class\nArbitrations (effective Oct. 8, 2003), online at\nhttp://www.adr.org/ sp.asp?id=21936, with Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 23. And while parties can alter those procedures by\ncontract, an alternative is not obvious. If procedures are too\ninformal, absent class members would not be bound by the\narbitration. For a class-action money judgment to bind absentees in\nlitigation, class representatives must at all times adequately\nrepresent absent class members, and absent members must be afforded\nnotice, an opportunity to be heard, and a right to opt out of the\nclass. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts , 472 U. S. 797 , 811–812\n(1985). At least this amount of process would presumably be\nrequired for absent parties to be bound by the results of\narbitration. We find it unlikely that in\npassing the FAA Congress meant to leave the disposition of these\nprocedural requirements to an arbitrator. Indeed, class arbitration\nwas not even envisioned by Congress when it passed the FAA in 1925;\nas the California Supreme Court admitted in Discover Bank ,\nclass arbitration is a “relatively recent development.” 36 Cal.\n4th, at 163, 113 P. 3d, at 1110. And it is at the very least\nodd to think that an arbitrator would be entrusted with ensuring\nthat third parties’ due process rights are satisfied. Third, class arbitration greatly\nincreases risks to defendants. Informal procedures do of course\nhave a cost: The absence of multilayered review makes it more\nlikely that errors will go uncorrected. Defendants are willing to\naccept the costs of these errors in arbitration, since their impact\nis limited to the size of individual disputes, and presumably\noutweighed by savings from avoiding the courts. But when damages\nallegedly owed to tens of thousands of potential claimants are\naggregated and decided at once, the risk of an error will often\nbecome unacceptable. Faced with even a small chance of a\ndevastating loss, defendants will be pressured into settling\nquestionable claims. Other courts have noted the risk of “in\nterrorem” settlements that class actions entail, see, e.g. , Kohen v. Pacific Inv. Management Co.\nLLC , 571 F. 3d 672, 677–678 (CA7 2009), and class\narbitration would be no different. Arbitration is poorly suited to\nthe higher stakes of class litigation. In litigation, a defendant\nmay appeal a certification decision on an interlocutory basis and,\nif unsuccessful, may appeal from a final judgment as well.\nQuestions of law are reviewed de novo and questions of\nfact for clear error. In contrast, 9 U. S. C. §10 allows a\ncourt to vacate an arbitral award only where the award\n“was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means”; “there was\nevident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators”; “the\narbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the\nhearing … or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to\nthe controve",

COURT OF APPEALS OF MARYLAND\net al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit No. 10–1016. Argued January 11, 2012—Decided\nMarch 20, 2012 The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993\n(FMLA) entitles an employee to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid\nleave per year for (A) the care of a newborn son or daughter; (B)\nthe adoption or foster-care placement of a child; (C) the care of a\nspouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious medical condition;\nand (D) the employee’s own serious health condition when the\ncondition interferes with the employee’s ability to perform at\nwork. 29 U. S. C. §2612(a)(1). The FMLA also creates a\nprivate right of action for equitable relief and damages “against\nany employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State\ncourt.” §2617(a)(2). For present purposes, subparagraphs (A), (B),\nand (C) are referred to as the family-care provisions, and\nsubparagraph (D) as the self-care provision. In Nevada Dept. of\nHuman Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U.S.\n721 , 730−732, this Court held that Congress could subject\nStates to suit for violations of subparagraph (C) based on evidence\nof family-leave policies that discriminated on the basis of\nsex. Petitioner filed suit, alleging that his\nemployer, the Maryland Court of Appeals, an instrumentality of the\nState, violated the FMLA by denying him self-care leave. The\nFederal District Court dismissed the suit on sovereign immunity\ngrounds. The Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that unlike the\nfamily-care provision in Hibbs , the self-care provision was\nnot directed at an identified pattern of gender-based\ndiscrimination and was not congruent and proportional to any\npattern of sex-based discrimination on the part of States. Held: The judgment is\naffirmed. 626 F.3d 187, affirmed. Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice,\nJustice Thomas, and Justice Alito, concluded that suits against\nStates under the self-care provision are barred by sovereign\nimmunity. Pp. 3−12. (a) Under the federal system, States, as\nsovereigns, are immune from damages suits, unless they waive that\ndefense. See, e.g., Kimel v. Florida Bd. of\nRegents , 528 U.S.\n62 , 72−73. Congress may also abrogate the States’ immunity\npursuant to its powers under §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, but it\nmust make that intention “unmistakably clear in the language of the\nstatute,” Hibbs , supra , at 726. It did so in the\nFMLA. Congress also “must tailor” legislation enacted under §5 “to\nremedy or prevent” “conduct transgressing the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s substantive provisions.” Florida Prepaid\nPostsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank , 527 U.S.\n627 , 639. “There must be a congruence and proportionality\nbetween the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means\nadopted to that end.” City of Boerne v. Flores , 521 U.S.\n507 , 520. Pp. 3−5. (b) The sex-based discrimination that\nsupported allowing subparagraph (C) suits against States is absent\nwith respect to the self-care provision. Petitioner’s three\narguments to the contrary are unpersuasive. Pp. 5–12. (1) Petitioner maintains that the\nself-care provision addresses sex discrimination and sex\nstereotyping. But the provision, standing alone, is not a valid\nabrogation of the States’ immunity from suit. At the time the FMLA\nwas enacted, there was no evidence of such discrimination or\nstereotyping in sick-leave policies. Congress was concerned about\nthe economic burdens imposed by illness-related job loss on\nemployees and their families and about discrimination based on\nillness, not sex. Although the self-care provision offers some\nwomen a benefit by allowing them to take leave for\npregnancy-related illnesses, the provision, as a remedy, is not\ncongruent and proportional to any identified constitutional\nviolations. When the FMLA was enacted, Congress had no evidence\nthat States were excluding pregnancy-related illnesses from their\nleave policies. Pp. 6–7. (2) Petitioner also argues that the\nself-care provision is a necessary adjunct to the family-care\nprovision sustained in Hibbs. But his claim—that the\nprovisions work in tandem to ensure the equal availability of total\nFMLA leave time to women and men despite their different\nleave-usage patterns―is unconvincing and does not comply with the\nrequirements of City of Boerne . Also, there are no\ncongressional findings of, or evidence on, how the self-care\nprovision is necessary to the family-care provisions or how it\nreduces employer discrimination against women. Pp. 8–11. (3) Finally, petitioner contends that the\nself-care provision helps single parents keep their jobs when they\nget ill. The fact that most single parents happen to be women\ndemonstrates, at most, that the self-care provision was directed at\nremedying neutral leave restrictions that have a disparate effect\non women. However, “[a]lthough disparate impact may be relevant\nevidence of . . . discrimination . . . such\nevidence is insufficient [to prove a constitutional violation] even\nwhere the Fourteenth Amendment subjects state action to strict\nscrutiny.” Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett , 531 U.S.\n356 , 373. Because it is unlikely that many of the neutral leave\npolicies affected by the self-care provision are unconstitutional,\nthe scope of the self-care provision is out of proportion to its\nsupposed remedial or preventive objectives. Pp. 11−12. Justice Scalia adhered to his view that the\nCourt should abandon the “congruence and proportionality” approach\nin favor of one that is properly tied to the text of §5, which\ngrants Congress the power “to enforce, by appropriate legislation,”\nthe other provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. Outside the\ncontext of racial discrimination, Congress’s §5 power should be\nlimited to the regulation of conduct that itself violates the\nFourteenth Amendment and thus would not reach a State’s failure to\ngrant self-care leave to its employees. Pp. 1−2. Kennedy, J., announced the judgment of the\nCourt and delivered an opinion, in which Roberts, C. J., and\nThomas and Alito JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring\nopinion. Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.\nGinsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Breyer, J.,\njoined, and in which Sotomayor and Kagan, JJ., joined as to all but\nfootnote 1.

Court of\nAppeals of Maryland et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fourth circuit [March 20, 2012] Justice Kennedy announced the judgment of the\nCourt and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief Justice, Justice\nThomas, and Justice Alito joined. The question in this case is whether a state\nemployee is allowed to recover damages from the state entity that\nemploys him by invoking one of the provisions of a federal statute\nthat, in express terms, seeks to abrogate the States’ immunity from\nsuits for damages. The statute in question is the Family and\nMedical Leave Act of 1993, 107Stat. 6, 29 U. S. C. §2601 et seq . The provision at issue requires employers, including\nstate employers, to grant unpaid leave for self care for a serious\nmedical condition, provided other statutory requisites are met,\nparticularly requirements that the total amount of annual leave\ntaken under all the Act’s provisions does not exceed a stated\nmaximum. §2612(a)(1)(d). In agreement with every Court of Appeals\nto have addressed this question, this Court now holds that suits\nagainst States under this provision are barred by the States’\nimmunity as sovereigns in our federal system. See\nmetricconverter626 F.3d 187 (CA4 2010) (case below); Nelson v. University of Tex. , metricconverter535 F.3d 318 (CA5\n2008); Miles v.

I A The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA\nor Act) entitles eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of\nunpaid leave per year. An employee may take leave under the FMLA\nfor: (A) “the birth of a son or daughter . . . in order\nto care for such son or daughter,” (B) the adoption or foster-care\nplacement of a child with the employee, (C) the care of a “spouse\n. . . son, daughter, or parent” with “a serious health\ncondition,” and (D) the employee’s own serious health condition\nwhen the condition interferes with the employee’s ability to\nperform at work. 29 U. S. C. §2612(a)(1). The Act creates\na private right of action to seek both equitable relief and money\ndamages “against any employer (including a public agency) in any\nFederal or State court of competent jurisdiction.” §2617(a)(2). As\nnoted, subparagraph (D) is at issue here. This Court considered subparagraph (C) in Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U.S.\n721 (2003). Subparagraph (C), like (A) and (B), grants leave\nfor reasons related to family care, and those three provisions are\nreferred to here as the family-care provisions. Hibbs held\nthat Congress could subject the States to suit for violations of\nsubparagraph (C), §2612(a)(1)(C). That holding rested on evidence\nthat States had family-leave policies that differentiated on the\nbasis of sex and that States administered even neutral family-leave\npolicies in ways that discriminated on the basis of sex. See id., at 730–732. Subparagraph (D), the self-care provision,\nwas not at issue in Hibbs . B Petitioner Daniel Coleman was employed by the\nCourt of Appeals of the State of Maryland. When Coleman requested\nsick leave, he was informed he would be terminated if he did not\nresign. Coleman then sued the state court in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Maryland, alleging, inter\nalia , that his employer violated the FMLA by failing to provide\nhim with self-care leave. The District Court dismissed the suit on the\nbasis that the Maryland Court of Appeals, as an entity of a\nsovereign State, was immune from the suit for damages. The parties\ndo not dispute the District Court’s ruling that the Maryland Court\nof Appeals is an entity or instrumentality of the State for\npurposes of sovereign immunity. The District Court concluded the\nFMLA’s self-care provision did not validly abrogate the State’s\nimmunity from suit. App. to Pet. for Cert. 15–20. The Court of\nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that, unlike the\nfamily-care provision at issue in Hibbs , the self-care\nprovision was not directed at an identified pattern of gender-based\ndiscrimination and was not congruent and proportional to any\npattern of sex-based discrimination on the part of States. 626 F.3d\n187. Certiorari was granted. 564 U. S. ___ (2011). II A A foundational premise of the federal system\nis that States, as sovereigns, are immune from suits for damages,\nsave as they elect to waive that defense. See Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents , 528 U.S.\n62 , 72–73 (2000); Alden v. Maine , 527 U.S.\n706 (1999). As an exception to this principle, Congress may\nabrogate the States’ immunity from suit pursuant to its powers\nunder §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer , 427 U.S.\n445 (1976) . Congress must “mak[e] its intention to abrogate\nunmistakably clear in the language of the statute.” Hibbs ,\n538 U. S., at 726. On this point the Act does express the\nclear purpose to abrogate the States’ immunity. Ibid. (“The\nclarity of Congress’ intent” to abrogate the States’ immunity from\nsuits for damages under the FMLA “is not fairly debatable”).\nCongress subjected any “public agency” to suit under the FMLA, 29\nU. S. C. §2617(a)(2), and a “public agency” is defined to\ninclude both “the government of a State or political subdivision\nthereof” and “any agency of . . . a State, or a political\nsubdivision of a State,” §§203(x), 2611(4)(A)(iii). The question then becomes whether the self-care\nprovision and its attempt to abrogate the States’ immunity are a\nvalid exercise of congressional power under §5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Section 5 grants Congress the power “to enforce” the\nsubstantive guarantees of §1 of the Amendment by “appropriate\nlegislation.” The power to enforce “ ‘includes the authority\nboth to remedy and to deter violation[s] of rights\nguaranteed’ ” by §1. See Board of Trustees of Univ. of\nAla. v. Garrett , 531 U.S.\n356 , 365 (2001) (quoting Kimel , supra , at 81). To\nensure Congress’ enforcement powers under §5 remain enforcement\npowers, as envisioned by the ratifiers of the Amendment, rather\nthan powers to redefine the substantive scope of §1, Congress “must\ntailor” legislation enacted under §5 “ ‘to rem- edy or\nprevent’ ” “conduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment’s\nsubstantive provisions.” Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed.\nExpense Bd. v. College Savings Bank , 527 U.S.\n627 , 639 (1999). Whether a congressional Act passed under §5 can\nimpose monetary liability upon States requires an assessment of\nboth the “ ‘evil’ or ‘wrong’ that Congress intended to\nremedy,” ibid. , and the means Congress adopted to address\nthat evil, see City of Boerne v. Flores , 521 U.S.\n507 , 520 (1997). Legislation enacted under §5 must be targeted\nat “conduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive\nprovisions.” Florida Prepaid , supra, at 639; see Kimel , supra, at 88; City of Boerne , 521\nU. S., at 525. And “[t]here must be a congruence and\nproportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and\nthe means adopted to that end.” Id., at 520. Under this analysis Hibbs permitted\nemployees to recover damages from States for violations of\nsubparagraph (C). In enacting the FMLA, Congress relied upon\nevidence of a well-documented pattern of sex-based discrimination\nin family-leave policies. States had facially discriminatory leave\npolicies that granted longer periods of leave to women than to men.\n538 U. S. , at 730–731. States also administered\nfacially neutral family-leave policies in gender-biased ways. Id., at 732. These practices reflected what Congress found\nto be a “pervasive sex-role stereotype that caring for family\nmembers is women’s work,” id., at 731, a stereotype to which\neven this Court had succumbed in earlier times, id., at 729.\nFaced with “the States’ record of unconstitutional participation\nin, and fostering of, gender-based discrimination in the\nadministration of leave benefits,” Hibbs concluded that\nrequiring state employers to give all employees the opportunity to\ntake family-care leave was “narrowly targeted at the faultline\nbetween work and family—precisely where sex-based\novergeneralization has been and remains strongest.” Id., at\n735, 738. B The same cannot be said for requiring the\nStates to give all employees the opportunity to take self-care\nleave. Petitioner advances three arguments for allowing employees\nto recover damages from States that violate the FMLA’s self-care\nprovision: The self-care provision standing alone addresses sex\ndiscrimination and sex stereotyping; the provision is a necessary\nadjunct to the family-care provision sustained in Hibbs; and\nthe provision eases the burden on single parents. But what the\nfamily-care provisions have to support them, the self-care\nprovision lacks, namely evidence of a pattern of state\nconstitutional violations accompanied by a remedy drawn in narrow\nterms to address or prevent those violations. 1 Standing alone, the self-care provision is not\na valid abrogation of the States’ immunity from suit. When the FMLA\nwas enacted, “ninety-five percent of full-time state- and\nlocal-government employees were covered by paid sick leave plans\nand ninety-six percent of such employees likewise enjoyed\nshort-term disability protection.” Brief for States of Texas\net al. as Amici Curiae 13–14 (hereinafter Texas Brief)\n(citing Bureau of Labor Statistics, U. S. Dept. of Labor,\nEmployee Benefits in State and Local Governments 17–26 (1994)\n(hereinafter BLS Rept.)). The evidence did not suggest States had\nfacially discriminatory self-care leave policies or that they\nadministered neutral self-care leave policies in a discriminatory\nway. And there is scant evidence in the legislative history of a\npurported stereotype harbored by employers that women take\nself-care leave more often than men. Congress considered evidence\nthat “men and women are out on medical leave approximately\nequally.” H. R. Rep. No. 101–28, pt. 1, p. 15 (1989)\n(hereinafter H. R. Rep.). Nothing in the record shows\nemployers formulated self-care leave policies based on a contrary\nview. Without widespread evidence of sex\ndiscrimination or sex stereotyping in the administration of sick\nleave, it is apparent that the congressional purpose in enacting\nthe self-care provision is unrelated to these supposed wrongs. The\nlegislative history of the self-care provision reveals a concern\nfor the economic burdens on the employee and the employee’s family\nresulting from illness-related job loss and a concern for\ndiscrimination on the basis of illness, not sex. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 103–3, pp. 11–12 (1993); H. R. Rep., at 23.\nIn the findings pertinent to the self-care provision, the statute\nmakes no reference to any distinction on the basis of sex. See 29\nU. S. C. §2601(a)(4) (“[T]here is inadequate job security\nfor employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them\nfrom working for temporary periods”). By contrast, with regard to\nfamily care Congress invoked concerns related to gender. See\n§2601(a)(5) (“[D]ue to the nature of the roles of men and women in\nour society, the primary responsibility for family caretaking often\nfalls on women, and such responsibility affects the working lives\nof women more than it affects the working lives of men”). It is true the self-care provision offers some\nwomen a benefit by allowing them to take leave for\npregnancy-related illnesses; but as a remedy, the provision is not\ncongruent and proportional to any identified constitutional\nviolations. At the time of the FMLA’s enactment, “ninety-five\npercent” of state employees had paid sick-leave plans at work, and\n“ninety-six percent” had short-term disability protection. Texas\nBrief 13–14 (citing BLS Rept. 17–26). State employees presumably\ncould take leave for pregnancy-related illnesses under these\npolicies, and Congress did not document any pattern of States\nexcluding pregnancy-related illnesses from sick-leave or\ndisability-leave policies. “Congress . . . said nothing\nabout the existence or adequacy of state remedies.” Florida\nPrepaid , 527 U. S. , at 644. It follows that\nabrogating the States’ immunity from suits for damages for failure\nto give self-care leave is not a congruent and proportional remedy\nif the existing state leave policies would have sufficed. 2 As an alternative justification for the\nself-care provision, it has been suggested that the provision is a\nnecessary adjunct to the family-care provisions. Petitioner argues\nthat employers may assume women are more likely to take family-care\nleave than men and that the FMLA therefore offers up to 12 weeks of\nleave for family care and self care combined. According to\npetitioner, when the self-care provision is coupled with the\nfamily-care provisions, the self-care provision could reduce the\ndifference in the expected number of weeks of FMLA leave that\ndifferent employees take for different reasons. The fact that self-care leave could have this\neffect does not mean that it would. If, for example, women are\nexpected to take 20 days of family-care leave per year and men to\ntake 10, and women and men are each expected to take 5 days of\nself-care leave per year, the difference in the expected number of\ndays of leave and cost to the employer remains the same regardless\nof the availability of self-care leave. Congress made no findings,\nand received no specific testimony, to suggest the availability of\nself-care leave equalizes the expected amount of FMLA leave men and\nwomen will take. Even if women take family-care leave more often\nthan men, men do not take self-care leave more often than women;\nand there is little evidence that employers assume they do. See\nH. R. Rep., at 15. Petitioner suggests that some women will be\nexpected to take all 12 weeks of leave under the FMLA for\nfamily-care purposes, and therefore that any amount of self-care\nleave taken by men will diminish the difference in the amount of\nFMLA leave taken by men and women. But there is little evidence to\nsupport petitioner’s assumption about the magnitude of women’s\nexpected FMLA leave for family-care purposes. And men are only\nexpected to take five days of sick leave per year, see ibid., so the self-care provision diminishes the difference\nin expected leave time by a maximum of five days. And that is only\nto the extent women use all their available FMLA leave for\nfamily-care reasons. Petitioner’s overly complicated argument about\nhow the self-care provision works in tandem with the family-care\nprovisions is unconvincing and in the end does not comply with the\nclear requirements of City of Boerne . In addition petitioner’s first defense of the\nself-care provision contradicts his second defense of the\nprovision. In the first defense, the Court is told employers assume\nwomen take more self-care leave than men. See Tr. of Oral Arg.\n10–12. In the second defense, the Court is told the self-care\nprovision provides an incentive to hire women that will counteract\nthe incentives created by the family-care provisions because\nemployers assume women take more family-care leave than men. But if\nthe first defense is correct, the second defense is wrong. In other\nwords, if employers assume women take self-care leave more often\nthan men (the first defense), a self-care provision will not\nprovide an incentive to hire women. To the contrary, the self-care\nprovision would provide an incentive to discriminate against\nwomen. There is “little support in the record for the\nconcerns that supposedly animated” the self-care provision. Florida Prepaid , supra , at 639. Only supposition and\nconjecture support the contention that the self-care provision is\nnecessary to make the family-care provisions effective. The\nevidence documented in support of the self-care provision is, to a\nlarge degree, unrelated to sex discrimination, or to the\nadministration of the family-care provisions. See supra, at\n7. Congress made no findings and did not cite specific or detailed\nevidence to show how the self-care provision is necessary to the\nfamily-care provisions or how it reduces an employer’s incentives\nto discriminate against women. And “Congress . . . said\nnothing about the existence or adequacy of state” sick-leave\npolicies. Florida Prepaid , supra , at 644; see Garrett , 531 U. S., at 373. Under this Court’s\nprecedents, more is required to sub- ject unconsenting States to\nsuits for damages, particularly where, as here, it is for\nviolations of a provision (the self-care provision) that is a\nsupposedly preventive step in aid of already preventive provisions\n(the family-care provisions). See Florida Prepaid , 527\nU. S., at 642 (“[T]he legislative record still provides little\nsupport for the prop- osition that Congress sought to remedy a\nFourteenth Amendment violation in enacting the Patent Remedy Act”); Kimel , 528 U. S., at 88 (“One means by which we have\nmade such a determination . . . is by examining the\nlegislative record containing the reasons for Congress’\naction”). The “few fleeting references” to how self-care\nleave is inseparable from family-care leave fall short of what is\nrequired for a valid abrogation of States’ immunity from suits for\ndamages. Florida Prepaid , supra , at 644. These\n“isolated sentences clipped from floor debates” and testimony, Kimel , supra , at 89, are stated as conclusions,\nunsupported by evidence or findings about how the self-care\nprovision interrelates to the family-care provisions to counteract\nemployers’ incentives to discriminate against women. Congress must\nrely on more than abstract generalities to subject the States to\nsuits for damages. Otherwise, Congress could choose to combat the\npurported effects of the family-care provisions by allowing\nemployees to sue States that do not permit employees to take\nvacation time under the FMLA. There is nothing in particular about\nself-care leave, as opposed to leave for any personal reason, that\nconnects it to gender discrimination. And when the issue, as here,\nis whether subparagraph (D) can abrogate a State’s immunity from\ndamages, there is no sufficient nexus, or indeed any demonstrated\nnexus, between self-care leave and gender discrimination by state\nemployers. Documented discrimination against women in the general\nworkplace is a persistent, unfortunate reality, and, we must\nassume, a still prevalent wrong. An explicit purpose of the\nCongress in adopting the FMLA was to improve workplace conditions\nfor women. See 29 U. S. C. §§2601(b)(4), (5). But States\nmay not be subject to suits for damages based on violations of a\ncomprehensive statute unless Congress has identified a specific\npattern of constitutional violations by state employers. See City of Boerne , 521 U. S., at 532. 3 The petitioner’s last defense of the self-care\nprovision is that the provision helps single parents retain their\njobs when they become ill. This, however, does not explain how the\nprovision remedies or prevents constitutional violations. The fact\nthat most single parents happen to be women, see, e.g., S. Rep. No. 103–3, at 7, demonstrates, at most, that the\nself-care provision was directed at remedying employers’ neutral\nleave restrictions which have a disparate effect on women.\n“Although disparate impact may be relevant evidence of\n. . . discrimination . . . such evidence alone\nis insufficient [to prove a constitutional violation] even where\nthe Fourteenth Amendment subjects state action to strict scrutiny.” Garrett , supra, at 372–373; see Tuan Anh\nNguyen v. INS , 533 U.S.\n53 , 82–83 (2001) (O’Connor, J., dissenting); Washington v. Davis , 426 U.S.\n229 , 239 (1976). To the extent, then, that the self-care\nprovision addresses neutral leave policies with a disparate impact\non women, it is not directed at a pattern of constitutional\nviolations. Because, moreover, it is “unlikely that many of the\n[neutral leave policies] . . . affected by” the self-care\nprovision are unconstitutional, “the scope of the [self-care\nprovision is] out of proportion to its supposed remedial or\npreventive objectives.” Kimel , supra, at 82; see City of Boerne , supra , at 519. Of course, a State need not assert its Eleventh\nAmendment immunity from suits for damages. See, e.g., Sossamon v. Texas , 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011)\n(slip op., at 5) (“A State . . . may choose to waive its\nimmunity in federal court at its pleasure”). Discrimination against\nwomen is contrary to the public policy of the State of Maryland,\nsee, e.g., Maryland’s Fair Employment Practices Act, Md.\nState Govt. Code Ann. §20–606 (Lexis 2009), and the State has\nconceded that the Act is good social policy, see Tr. of Oral Arg.\n35. If the State agrees with petitioner that damages liability for\nviolations of the self-care provision is necessary to combat\ndiscrimination against women, the State may waive its immunity or\ncreate a parallel state law cause of action. *  *  * As a consequence of our constitutional design,\nmoney damages are the exception when sovereigns are defendants.\nSee, e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman , 451 U.S.\n1 , 29 (1981). Subjecting States to suits for damages pursuant\nto §5 requires more than a theory for why abrogating the States’\nimmunity aids in, or advances, a stated congressional purpose. To\nabrogate the States’ immunity from suits for damages under §5,\nCongress must identify a pattern of constitutional violations and\ntailor a remedy congruent and proportional to the documented\nviolations. It failed to do so when it allowed employees to sue\nStates for violations of the FMLA’s self-care provision. The\njudgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. It is so ordered.",

THOMAS, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA\nDEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eleventh circuit No. 10–63. Argued October 4, 2011—January 18,\n2012 Petitioner Cory R. Maples was found guilty of\nmurder and sentenced to death in Alabama state court. In 2001,\nMaples sought postconviction relief in state court under Alabama\nRule 32. Maples alleged, among other things, that his underpaid and\ninexperienced trial attorneys failed to afford him the effective\nassistance guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. His petition was\nwritten by two pro bono attorneys, Jaasai Munanka and Clara\nIngen-Housz, both associated with the New York offices of the\nSullivan & Cromwell law firm. As required by Alabama law, the\ntwo attorneys engaged an Alabama lawyer, John Butler, to move their\nadmission pro hac vice. Butler made clear, however, that he\nwould undertake no substantive involvement in the case. In 2002, while Maples’ state postconviction\npetition was pending, Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan &\nCromwell. Their new employment disabled them from representing\nMaples. They did not inform Maples of their departure and\nconsequent inability to serve as his counsel. In disregard of\nAlabama law, neither sought the trial court’s leave to withdraw. No\nother Sullivan & Cromwell attorney entered an appearance, moved\nto substitute counsel, or otherwise notified the court of a change\nin Maples’ representation. Thus, Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler\nremained Maples’ listed, and only, attorneys of record. The trial court denied Maples’ petition in May\n2003. Notices of the order were posted to Munanka and Ingen-Housz\nat Sullivan & Cromwell’s address. When those postings were\nreturned, unopened, the trial court clerk attempted no further\nmailing. Butler also received a copy of the order, but did not act\non it. With no attorney of record in fact acting on Maples’ behalf,\nthe 42-day period Maples had to file a notice of appeal ran\nout. About a month later, an Alabama Assistant\nAttorney General sent a letter directly to Maples. The letter\ninformed Maples of the missed deadline and notified him that he had\nfour weeks remaining to file a federal habeas petition. Maples\nimmediately contacted his mother, who called Sullivan &\nCromwell. Three Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys, through Butler,\nmoved the trial court to reissue its order, thereby restarting the\n42-day appeal period. The court denied the motion. The Alabama\nCourt of Criminal Appeals then denied a writ of mandamus that would\nhave granted Maples leave to file an out-of-time appeal, and the\nState Supreme Court affirmed. Thereafter, Maples sought federal habeas\nrelief. Both the District Court and the Eleventh Circuit denied his\nrequest, pointing to the procedural default in state court, i.e ., Maples’ failure timely to appeal the state trial\ncourt’s order denying his Rule 32 petition for postconviction\nrelief. Held: Maples has shown the\nrequisite “cause” to excuse his procedural default.\nPp. 11–22. (a) As a rule, a federal court may not\nentertain a state prisoner’s habeas claims “when (1) ‘a state court\n[has] declined to address [those] claims because the prisoner had\nfailed to meet a state procedural requirement,’ and (2) ‘the state\njudgment rests on independent and adequate state procedural\ngrounds.’ ” Walker v. Martin , 562 U. S.\n___, ___. The bar to federal review may be lifted, however, if “the\nprisoner can demonstrate cause for the [procedural] default [in\nstate court] and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged\nviolation of federal law.” Coleman v. Thompson , 501 U.S.\n722 , 750. Cause for a procedural default exists where\n“something external to the petitioner, something that cannot\nfairly be attributed to him[,] . . . ‘impeded [his]\nefforts to comply with the State’s procedural rule.’ ” Id., at 753. A prisoner’s postconviction attorney’s\nnegligence does not qualify as “cause,” ibid., because the\nattorney is the prisoner’s agent, and under “well-settled” agency\nlaw, the principal bears the risk of his agent’s negligent conduct, id., at 753–754. Thus, a petitioner is bound by his\nattorney’s failure to meet a filing deadline and cannot rely on\nthat failure to establish cause. Ibid. A markedly different situation arises,\nhowever, when an attorney abandons his client without notice, and\nthereby occasions the default. In such cases, the principal-agent\nrelationship is severed and the attorney’s acts or omissions\n“cannot fairly be attributed to [the client].” Id., at 753.\nNor can the client be faulted for failing to act on his own behalf\nwhen he lacks reason to believe his attorneys of record, in fact,\nare not representing him. Holland v. Florida , 560\nU. S. ___, is instructive . There, the Court found that\nthe one-year deadline for filing a federal habeas petition can be\ntolled for equitable reasons, and that an attorney’s unprofessional\nconduct may sometimes be an “extraordinary circumstance” justifying\nequitable tolling. Id. , at ___, ___–___. The Court\nrecognized that an attorney’s negligence does not provide a basis\nfor tolling a statutory time limit. Id., at ___. Holland’s\nclaim that he was abandoned by his attorney, however, if true,\n“would suffice to establish extraordinary circumstances beyond his\ncontrol,” id., at ___ (opinion of Alito, J.) . Pp. 11–15. (b) From the time of his initial Rule 32\npetition until well after time ran out for appealing the trial\ncourt’s denial of that petition, Maples’ sole attorneys of record\nwere Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler. Unknown to Maples, none of\nthose lawyers was in fact serving as his attorney during the 42-day\nappeal period. Pp. 15–21. (1) The State contends that Sullivan\n& Cromwell represented Maples throughout his state\npostconviction proceedings, and that, as a result, Maples cannot\nestablish abandonment by counsel during the 42-day period. But it\nis undisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz severed their agency\nrelationship with Maples long before the default occurred.\nFurthermore, because the attorneys did not seek the trial court’s\npermission to withdraw, they allowed court records to convey that\nthey remained the attorneys of record. As such, the attorneys, not\nMaples, would be the addressees of court orders Alabama law\nrequires the clerk to furnish. The State asserts that, after Munanka’s and\nIngen-Housz’s departure, other Sullivan & Cromwell attorneys\ncame forward to serve as Maples’ counsel. At the time of the\ndefault, however, those attorneys had not been admitted to practice\nin Alabama, had not entered their appearances on Maples’ behalf,\nand had done nothing to inform the Alabama court that they wished\nto substitute for Munanka and Ingen- Housz. Thus, they lacked the\nlegal authority to act on Maples’ behalf before his time to appeal\nexpired. Pp. 15–19. (2) Maples’ only other attorney of\nrecord, local counsel Butler, did not even begin to represent\nMaples. Butler told Munanka and Ingen-Housz that he would serve as\nlocal counsel only for the purpose of enabling them to appear pro hac vice and would play no substantive role in the case.\nOther factors confirm that Butler was not Maples’ “agent in any\nmeaningful sense of that word.” Holland , 560 U. S., at\n___ (opinion of Alito, J.). Upon receiving a copy of the trial\ncourt’s order, Butler did not contact Sullivan & Cromwell to\nensure that firm lawyers were taking appropriate action. Nor did\nthe State treat Butler as Maples’ actual representative. Notably,\nthe Alabama Assistant Attorney General wrote directly and only to\nMaples, notwithstanding an ethical obligation to refrain from\ncommunicating directly with an opposing party known to be\nrepresented by counsel. Pp. 19–20. (3) Not only was Maples left without any\nfunctioning attorney of record; the very listing of Munanka,\nIngen-Housz, and Butler as his representatives meant that he had no\nright personally to receive notice. He in fact received none within\nthe 42 days allowed for commencing an appeal. Given no reason to\nsuspect that he lacked counsel able and willing to represent him,\nMaples surely was blocked from complying with the State’s\nprocedural rule. Pp. 20–21. (c) “The cause and prejudice requirement\nshows due regard for States’ finality and comity interests while\nensuring that ‘fundamental fairness [remains] the central concern\nof the writ of habeas corpus.’ ” Dretke v. Haley , 541 U.S.\n386 , 393. In the unusual circumstances of this case, agency law\nprinciples and fundamental fairness point to the same conclusion:\nthere was indeed cause to excuse Maples’ procedural default.\nThrough no fault of his own, he lacked the assistance of any\nauthorized attorney during the 42-day appeal period. And he had no\nreason to suspect that, in reality, he had been reduced to pro se status. Pp. 21–22. (d) The question of prejudice, which\nneither the District Court nor the Eleventh Circuit reached,\nremains open for decision on remand. P. 22. 586 F.3d 879, reversed and remanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 10–63 _________________ CORY R. MAPLES, PETITIONER v. KIM T. THOMAS,\nCOMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eleventh circuit [January 18, 2012] Justice Ginsburg\ndelivered the opinion of the Court. Cory R. Maples is an\nAlabama capital prisoner sentenced to death in 1997 for the murder\nof two individuals. At trial, he was represented by two appointed\nlawyers, minimally paid and with scant experience in capital cases.\nMaples sought postconviction relief in state court, alleging\nineffective assistance of counsel and several other trial\ninfirmities. His petition, filed in August 2001, was written by two\nNew York attorneys serving pro bono, both associated with the same\nNew York-based large law firm. An Alabama attorney, designated as\nlocal counsel, moved the admission of the out-of-state counsel pro\nhac vice. As understood by New York counsel, local counsel would\nfacilitate their appearance, but would undertake no substantive\ninvolvement in the case. In the summer of 2002,\nwhile Maples’ postconviction petition remained pending in the\nAlabama trial court, his New York attorneys left the law firm;\ntheir new employment disabled them from continuing to represent\nMaples. They did not inform Maples of their departure and\nconsequent inability to serve as his counsel. Nor did they seek the\nAlabama trial court’s leave to withdraw. Neither they nor anyone\nelse moved for the substitution of counsel able to handle Maples’\ncase. In May 2003, the\nAlabama trial court denied Maples’ petition. Notices of the court’s\norder were posted to the New York attorneys at the address of the\nlaw firm with which they had been associated. Those postings were\nre-turned, unopened, to the trial court clerk, who attempt- ed no\nfurther mailing. With no attorney of record in fact acting on\nMaples’ behalf, the time to appeal ran out. Thereafter, Maples\npetitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. The\nDistrict Court and, in turn, the Eleventh Circuit, rejected his\npetition, pointing to the procedural default in state court, i.e.,\nMaples’ failure timely to appeal the Alabama trial court’s order\ndenying him postconviction relief. Maples, it is uncontested, was\nblameless for the default. The sole question this\nCourt has taken up for review is whether, on the extraordinary\nfacts of Maples’ case, there is “cause” to excuse the default.\nMaples maintains that there is, for the lawyers he believed to be\nvigilantly representing him had abandoned the case without leave of\ncourt, without informing Maples they could no longer represent him,\nand without securing any recorded substitution of counsel. We\nagree. Abandoned by counsel, Maples was left unrepresented at a\ncritical time for his state postconviction petition, and he lacked\na clue of any need to protect himself pro se. In these\ncircumstances, no just system would lay the default at Maples’\ndeath-cell door. Satisfied that the requisite cause has been shown,\nwe reverse the Eleventh Circuit’s judgment. I A Alabama sets low\neligibility requirements for lawyers appointed to represent\nindigent capital defendants at trial. American Bar Association,\nEvaluating Fairness and Accuracy in State Death Penalty Systems:\nThe Alabama Death Penalty Assessment Report 117–120 (June 2006)\n(hereinafter ABA Report); Brief for Alabama Appellate Court\nJustices et al. as Amici Curiae 7–8 (hereinafter Justices\nBrief). Appointed counsel need only be a member of the Alabama bar\nand have “five years’ prior experience in the active practice of\ncriminal law.” Ala. Code §13A–5–54 (2006). Experience with capital\ncases is not required. Justices Brief 7–8. Nor does the State\nprovide, or require appointed counsel to gain, any\ncapital-case-specific professional education or training. ABA\nReport 129–131; Jus-tices Brief 14–16. Appointed counsel in\ndeath penalty cases are also undercompensated. ABA Report 124–129;\nJustices Brief 12–14. Until 1999, the State paid appointed capital\ndefense attorneys just “$40.00 per hour for time expended in court\nand $20.00 per hour for time reasonably expended out of court in\nthe preparation of [the defendant’s] case.” Ala. Code §15–12–21(d)\n(1995). Although death penalty litigation is plainly time\nintensive, [ 1 ] the State\ncapped at $1,000 fees recoverable by capital defense attorneys for\nout-of-court work. Ibid. [ 2 ]\nEven today, court-appointed attorneys receive only $70 per hour.\n2011 Ala. Acts no. 2011–678, pp. 1072–1073, §6. Nearly alone among the\nStates, Alabama does not guarantee representation to indigent\ncapital defendants in postconviction proceedings. ABA Report\n111–112, 158–160; Justices Brief 33. The State has elected,\ninstead, “to rely on the efforts of typically well-funded\n[out-of-state] volunteers.” Brief in Opposition in Barbour v.\nAllen, O. T. 2006, No. 06–10605, p. 23. Thus, as of 2006, 86%\nof the attorneys representing Alabama’s death row inmates in state\ncollateral review proceedings “either worked for the Equal Justice\nInitiative (headed by NYU Law professor Bryan Stevenson),\nout-of-state public interest groups like the Innocence Project, or\nan out-of-state mega-firm.” Brief in Opposition 16, n. 4. On\noccasion, some prisoners sentenced to death receive no\npostconviction representation at all. See ABA Report 112 (“[A]s of\nApril 2006, approximately fifteen of Alabama’s death row inmates in\nthe fi-nal rounds of state appeals had no lawyer to represent\nthem.”). B This system was in\nplace when, in 1997, Alabama charged Maples with two counts of\ncapital murder; the victims, Stacy Alan Terry and Barry Dewayne\nRobinson II, were Maples’ friends who, on the night of the murders,\nhad been out on the town with him. Maples pleaded not guilty, and\nhis case proceeded to trial, where he was represented by two\ncourt-appointed Alabama attorneys. Only one of them had earlier\nserved in a capital case. See Tr. 3081. Neither counsel had\npreviously tried the penalty phase of a capital case. Compensation\nfor each lawyer was capped at $1,000 for time spent out-of-court\npreparing Maples’ case, and at $40 per hour for in-court services.\nSee Ala. Code §15–12–21 (1995). Finding Maples guilty\non both counts, the jury recommended that he be sentenced to death.\nThe vote was 10 to 2, the minimum number Alabama requires for a\ndeath recommendation. See Ala. Code §13A–5–46(f) (1994) (“The\ndecision of the jury to recommend a sentence of death must be based\non a vote of at least 10 jurors.”). Accepting the jury’s\nrecommendation, the trial court sentenced Maples to death. On\ndirect appeal, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and the\nAlabama Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and sentence.\nEx parte Maples, 758 So. 2d 81 (Ala. 1999); Maples v.\nState, 758 So. 2d 1 (Ala. Crim. App. 1999). We denied\ncertiorari. Maples v. Alabama, 531 U. S. 830 (2000) . Two out-of-state\nvolunteers represented Maples in postconviction proceedings: Jaasi\nMunanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, both associates at the New York\noffices of the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm. At the time,\nAlabama required out-of-state attorneys to associate local counsel\nwhen seeking admission to practice pro hac vice before an Alabama\ncourt, regardless of the nature of the proceeding. Rule Governing\nAdmission to the Ala. State Bar VII (2000) (hereinafter Rule VII).\n[ 3 ] The Alabama Rule further\nprescribed that the local attorney’s name “appear on all no-tices,\norders, pleadings, and other documents filed in the cause,” and\nthat local counsel “accept joint and several responsibility with\nthe foreign attorney to the client, to opposing parties and\ncounsel, and to the court or administrative agency in all matters\n[relating to the case].” Rule VII(C). Munanka and Ingen-Housz\nassociated Huntsville, Alabama attorney John Butler as local\ncounsel. Notwithstanding his obligations under Alabama law, Butler\ninformed Munanka and Ingen-Housz, “at the outset,” that he would\nserve as local counsel only for the purpose of allowing the two New\nYork attorneys to appear pro hac vice on behalf of Maples. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 255a. Given his lack of “resources, available time\n[and] experience,” Butler told the Sullivan & Cromwell lawyers,\nhe could not “deal with substantive issues in the case.” Ibid. The\nSullivan & Cromwell attorneys accepted Butler’s conditions.\nId., at 257a. This arrangement between out-of-state and local\nattorneys, it appears, was hardly atypical. See Justices Brief 36\n(“The fact is that local counsel for out-of-state attorneys in\npost-conviction litigation most often do nothing other than provide\nthe mechanism for foreign attorneys to be admitted.”). With the aid of his\npro bono counsel, Maples filed a petition for postconviction\nrelief under Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32. [ 4 ] Among other claims, Maples asserted that\nhis court-appointed attorneys provided con-stitutionally\nineffective assistance during both guilt and penalty phases of his\ncapital trial. App. 29–126. He alleged, in this regard, that his\ninexperienced and underfunded attorneys failed to develop and raise\nan obvious intoxication defense, did not object to several\negregious instances of prosecutorial misconduct, and woefully\nunderprepared for the penalty phase of his trial. The State\nresponded by moving for summary dismissal of Maples’ petition. On\nDecember 27, 2001, the trial court denied the State’s motion. Some seven months\nlater, in the summer of 2002, both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left\nSullivan & Cromwell. App. to Pet. for Cert. 258a. Munanka\ngained a clerkship with a federal judge; Ingen-Housz accepted a\nposition with the European Commission in Belgium. Ibid. Neither\nattorney told Maples of their departure from Sullivan &\nCromwell or of their resulting inability to continue to represent\nhim. In disregard of Alabama law, see Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 6.2,\nComment, neither attorney sought the trial court’s leave to\nwithdraw, App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a. Compounding Munanka’s and\nIngen-Housz’s inaction, no other Sullivan & Cromwell lawyer\nentered an appearance on Maples’ behalf, moved to substitute\ncounsel, or otherwise notified the court of any change in Maples’\nrepresentation. Ibid. Another nine months\npassed. During this time period, no Sullivan & Cromwell\nattorneys assigned to Maples’ case sought admission to the Alabama\nbar, entered appearances on Maples’ behalf, or otherwise advised\nthe Alabama court that Munanka and Ingen-Housz were no longer\nMaples’ attorneys. Thus, Munanka and Ingen-Housz (along with\nButler) remained Maples’ listed, and only, “attorneys of record.”\nId., at 223a. There things stood\nwhen, in May 2003, the trial court, without holding a hearing,\nentered an order denying Maples’ Rule 32 petition. App. 146–225. [ 5 ] The clerk of the Alabama\ntrial court mailed copies of the order to Maples’ three attorneys\nof record. He sent Munanka’s and Ingen-Housz’s copies to Sullivan\n& Cromwell’s New York address, which the pair had provided upon\nentering their appearances. When those copies\narrived at Sullivan & Cromwell, Munanka and Ingen-Housz had\nlong since departed. The notices, however, were not forwarded to\nanother Sullivan & Cromwell attorney. Instead, a mailroom\nemployee sent the unopened envelopes back to the court. “Returned\nto Sender—Attempted, Unknown” was stamped on the envelope addressed\nto Munanka. App. to Reply to Brief in Opposition 8a. A similar\nstamp appeared on the envelope addressed to Ingen-Housz, along with\nthe handwritten notation “Return to Sender—Left Firm.” Id., at\n7a. Upon receiving back the\nunopened envelopes he had mailed to Munanka and Ingen-Housz, the\nAlabama court clerk took no further action. In particular, the\nclerk did not contact Munanka or Ingen-Housz at the personal\ntelephone numbers or home addresses they had provided in their pro\nhac vice applications. See Ingen-Housz Verified Application for\nAdmission to Practice Under Rule VII, p. 1; and Munanka\nVerified Application for Admission to Practice Under Rule VII,\np. 1, in Maples v. State, No. CC–95–842.60 (C. C. Morgan\nCty., Ala.). Nor did the clerk alert Sullivan & Cromwell or\nButler. Butler received his copy of the order, but did not act on\nit. App. to Pet. for Cert. 256a. He assumed that Munanka and\nIngen-Housz, who had been “CC’d” on the order, would take care of\nfiling an appeal. Ibid. Meanwhile, the clock\nticked on Maples’ appeal. Under Alabama’s Rules of Appellate\nProcedure, Maples had 42 days to file a notice of appeal from the\ntrial court’s May 22, 2003 order denying Maples’ petition for\npostconviction relief. Rule 4(a)(1) (2000). No appeal notice was\nfiled, and the time allowed for filing expired on July 7, 2003. A little over a month\nlater, on August 13, 2003, Alabama Assistant Attorney General Jon\nHayden, the attorney representing the State in Maples’ collateral\nreview proceedings, sent a letter directly to Maples. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 253a–254a. Hayden’s letter informed Maples of the missed\ndeadline for initiating an appeal within the State’s system, and\nnotified him that four weeks remained during which he could file a\nfederal habeas petition. Ibid. Hayden mailed the letter to Maples\nonly, using his prison address. Ibid. No copy was sent to Maples’\nattorneys of record, or to anyone else acting on Maples’ behalf.\nIbid. Upon receiving the\nState’s letter, Maples immediately contacted his mother. Id., at\n258a. She telephoned Sullivan & Cromwell to inquire about her\nson’s case. Ibid. Prompted by her call, Sullivan & Cromwell\nattorneys Marc De Leeuw, Felice Duffy, and Kathy Brewer submitted a\nmotion, through Butler, asking the trial court to reissue its order\ndenying Maples’ Rule 32 petition, thereby restarting the 42-day\nappeal period. Id., at 222a. The trial court denied\nthe motion, id., at 222a–225a, not-ing that Munanka and Ingen-Housz\nhad not withdrawn from the case and, consequently, were “still\nattor- neys of record for the petitioner,” id., at 223a.\nFurthermore, the court added, attorneys De Leeuw, Duffy, and Brewer\nhad not “yet been admitted to practice in Alabama” or “entered\nappearances as attorneys of record.” Ibid. “How,” the court asked,\n“can a Circuit Clerk in Decatur, Alabama know what is going on in a\nlaw firm in New York, New York?” Id., at 223a–224a. Declining to\nblame the clerk for the missed notice of appeal deadline, the court\nsaid it was “unwilling to enter into subterfuge in order to gloss\nover mistakes made by counsel for the petitioner.” Ibid. Maples next petitioned\nthe Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals for a writ of mandamus,\ngranting him leave to file an out-of-time appeal. Rejecting Maples’\nplea, the Court of Criminal Appeals determined that, although the\nclerk had “assumed a duty to notify the parties of the resolution\nof Maples’s Rule 32 petition,” the clerk had satisfied that\nobligation by sending notices to the attorneys of record at the\naddresses those attorneys provided. Id., at 234a–235a. Butler’s\nreceipt of the order, the court observed, sufficed to notify all\nattorneys “in light of their apparent co-counsel status.” Id., at\n235a–236a (quoting Thomas v. Kellett, 489 So. 2d 554, 555\n(Ala. 1986)). The Alabama Supreme Court summarily affirmed the\nCourt of Criminal Appeals’ judgment, App. to Pet. for Cert. 237a,\nand this Court denied certiorari, Maples v. Alabama, 543 U. S.\n1148 (2005) . Having exhausted his\nstate postconviction remedies, Maples sought federal habeas corpus\nrelief. Addressing the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel\nclaims Maples stated in his federal petition, the State urged that\nMaples had forever forfeited those claims. Maples did, indeed,\npresent the claims in his state postconviction (Rule 32) petition,\nthe State observed, but he did not timely appeal from the trial\ncourt’s denial of his petition. That procedural default, the State\nmaintained, precluded federal-court consideration of the claims. [ 6 ] Maples replied that the\ndefault should be excused, because he missed the appeal deadline\n“through no fault of his own.” App. 262 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The District Court\ndetermined that Maples had defaulted his ineffective-assistance\nclaims, and that he had not shown “cause” sufficient to overcome\nthe default. App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a–55a. The court understood\nMaples to argue that errors committed by his postconviction\ncounsel, not any lapse on the part of the court clerk in Alabama,\nprovided the requisite “cause” to excuse his failure to meet\nAlabama’s 42-days-to-appeal Rule. Id., at 55a. Such an argument was\ninadmissible, the court ruled, because this Court, in Coleman v.\nThompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991) , had held that the\nineffectiveness of postconviction appellate counsel could not\nqualify as cause. App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a (citing Coleman, 501\nU. S., at 751). A divided panel of the\nEleventh Circuit affirmed. Maples v. Allen, 586 F. 3d 879\n(2009) (per curiam). In accord with the District Court, the\nCourt of Appeals’ majority held that Maples defaulted his\nineffective-assistance claims in state court by failing to file a\ntimely notice of appeal, id., at 890, and that Coleman rendered\nMaples’ assertion of “cause” unacceptable, 586 F. 3d, at\n891. Judge Barkett\ndissented. Id., at 895–898. She concluded that the Alabama Court of\nCriminal Appeals had acted “arbitrarily” in refusing to grant\nMaples’ request for an out-of-time appeal. Id., at 896. In a case\ninvolving “indistinguishable facts,” Judge Barkett noted, the\nAlabama appellate court had allowed the petitioner to file a late\nappeal. Ibid. (citing Marshall v. State, 884 So. 2d 898, 899\n(Ala. Crim. App. 2002)). Inconsistent application of the\n42-days-to-appeal rule, Judge Barkett said, “render[ed] the rule an\ninadequate ground on which to bar federal review of Maples’s\nclaims.” 586 F. 3d, at 897. The interests of justice, she\nadded, required review of Maples’ claims in view of the exceptional\ncircumstances and high stakes involved, and the absence of any\nfault on Maples’ part. Ibid. We granted certiorari\nto decide whether the uncommon facts presented here establish cause\nadequate to excuse Maples’ procedural default. 562 U. S. ___\n(2011). II A As a rule, a state\nprisoner’s habeas claims may not be entertained by a federal court\n“when (1) ‘a state court [has] declined to address [those] claims\nbecause the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural\nrequirement,’ and (2) ‘the state judgment rests on independent and\nadequate state procedural grounds.’ ” Walker v. Martin, 562\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 7) (quoting Coleman, 501\nU. S., at 729–730). The bar to federal review may be lifted,\nhowever, if “the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the\n[procedural] default [in state court] and actual prejudice as a\nresult of the alleged violation of federal law.” Id., at 750; see\nWainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 –85 (1977). Given the single issue\non which we granted review, we will assume, for purposes of this\ndecision, that the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals’ refusal to\nconsider Maples’ ineffective-assistance claims rested on an\nindepend-ent and adequate state procedural ground: namely, Maples’\nfailure to satisfy Alabama’s Rule requiring a notice of appeal to\nbe filed within 42 days from the trial court’s final order.\nAccordingly, we confine our consideration to the question whether\nMaples has shown cause to excuse the missed notice of appeal\ndeadline. Cause for a procedural\ndefault exists where “something external to the petitioner,\nsomething that cannot fairly be attributed to him[,]\n. . . ‘impeded [his] efforts to comply with the State’s\nprocedural rule.’ ” Coleman, 501 U. S., at 753 (quoting\nMurray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 488 (1986) ; emphasis in\noriginal). Negligence on the part of a prisoner’s postconviction\nattorney does not qualify as “cause.” Coleman, 501 U. S., at\n753. That is so, we reasoned in Coleman, because the attorney is\nthe prisoner’s agent, and under “well-settled principles of agency\nlaw,” the principal bears the risk of negligent conduct on the part\nof his agent. Id., at 753–754. See also Irwin v. Department of\nVeterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 92 (1990) (“Under our system\nof representative litigation, ‘each party is deemed bound by the\nacts of his lawyer-agent.’ ” (quoting Link v. Wabash R. Co.,\n370 U. S. 626, 634 (1962) )). Thus, when a petitioner’s\npostconviction attorney misses a filing deadline, the petitioner is\nbound by the oversight and cannot rely on it to establish cause.\nColeman, 501 U. S., at 753–754. We do not disturb that general\nrule. A markedly different\nsituation is presented, however, when an attorney abandons his\nclient without notice, and thereby occasions the default. Having\nsevered the principal-agent relationship, an attorney no longer\nacts, or fails to act, as the client’s representative. See 1\nRestatement (Third) of Law Governing Lawyers §31, Comment f (1998)\n(“Withdrawal, whether proper or improper, terminates the lawyer’s\nauthority to act for the client.”). His acts or omissions therefore\n“cannot fairly be attributed to [the client].” Coleman, 501\nU. S., at 753. See, e.g., Jamison v. Lockhart, 975 F. 2d\n1377, 1380 (CA8 1992) (attorney conduct may provide cause to excuse\na state procedural default where, as a result of a conflict of\ninterest, the attorney “ceased to be [petitioner’s] agent”); Porter\nv. State, 339 Ark. 15, 16–19, 2 S. W. 3d 73, 74–76 (1999)\n(finding “good cause” for petitioner’s failure to file a timely\nhabeas petition where the petitioner’s attorney terminated his\nrepresentation without notifying petitioner and without taking “any\nformal steps to withdraw as the attorney of record”). Our recent decision in\nHolland v. Florida, 560 U. S. ___ (2010), is instructive. That\ncase involved a missed one-year deadline, prescribed by 28\nU. S. C. §2244(d), for filing a federal habeas petition.\nHolland presented two issues: first, whether the §2244(d) time\nlimitation can be tolled for equitable reasons, and, second,\nwhether an attorney’s unprofessional conduct can ever count as an\n“extraordinary circumstance” justifying equitable tolling. 560\nU. S., at ___, ___–___ (slip op., at 1, 16–17) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). We answered yes to both questions. On the second issue,\nthe Court recognized that an at-torney’s negligence, for example,\nmiscalculating a filing deadline, does not provide a basis for\ntolling a statutory time limit. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19); id.,\nat ___–___ (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment) (slip op., at 5–6); see Lawrence v. Florida, 549\nU. S. 327, 336 (2007) . The Holland petitioner, however, urged\nthat attorney negligence was not the gravamen of his complaint.\nRather, he asserted that his lawyer had detached himself from any\ntrust relationship with his client: “[My lawyer] has abandoned me,”\nthe petitioner complained to the court. 560 U. S., at ___–___\n(slip op., at 3–4) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee Nara v. Frank, 264 F. 3d 310, 320 (CA3 2001) (ordering a\nhearing on whether a client’s effective abandonment by his lawyer\nmerited tolling of the one-year deadline for filing a federal\nhabeas petiti",

The District Court granted the motion and dismissed the\nlawsuits. The Second Circuit reversed and remanded, holding that\nbecause of the prohibitive costs respondents would face if they had\nto arbitrate, the class-action waiver was unenforceable and\narbitration could not proceed. The Circuit stood by its reversal\nwhen this Court remanded in light of Stolt-Nielsen\nS. A. v. AnimalFeeds International Corp. , 559 U.S.\n662 , which held that a party may not be compelled to submit to\nclass arbitration absent an agreement to do so. Held : The FAA does not permit\ncourts to invalidate a contractual waiver of class arbitration on\nthe ground that the plaintiff’s cost of individually\narbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the potential\nrecovery. Pp. 3–10. (a) The FAA reflects the overarching\nprinciple that arbitration is a matter of contract. See Rent-A-Center, West, Inc. v. Jackson , 561 U. S.\n___, ___. Courts must “rigorously enforce” arbitration\nagreements according to their terms, Dean Witter Reynolds,\nInc. v. Byrd , 470 U.S.\n213 , 221, even for claims alleging a violation of a federal\nstatute, unless the FAA’s mandate has been\n“ ‘overridden by a contrary congressional\ncommand,’ ” CompuCredit Corp. v. Greenwood , 565 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 3–4. (b) No contrary congressional command\nrequires rejection of the class-arbitration waiver here. The\nantitrust laws do not guarantee an affordable procedural path to\nthe vindication of every claim, see Rodriguez v. United\nStates , 480 U.S.\n522 , 525–526, or “evince an intention to preclude a\nwaiver” of class-action procedure, Mitsubishi Motors\nCorp. v. Soler-Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc. , 473\nU.S. 614 , 628. Nor does congressional approval of Federal Rule\nof Civil Procedure 23 establish an entitlement to class proceedings\nfor the vindication of statutory rights. The Rule imposes stringent\nrequirements for certification that exclude most claims, and this\nCourt has rejected the assertion that the class-notice requirement\nmust be dispensed with because the “prohibitively high\ncost” of compliance would “frustrate\n[plaintiff’s] attempt to vindicate the policies underlying\nthe antitrust” laws, Eisen v. Carlisle &\nJacquelin , 417 U.S.\n156 , 167–168, 175–176. Pp. 4–5. (c) The “effective\nvindication” exception that originated as dictum in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth,\nInc. , 473 U.S.\n614 , also does not invalidate the instant arbitration\nagreement. The exception comes from a desire to prevent\n“prospective waiver of a party’s right to pursue\nstatutory remedies,” id., at 637, n. 19; but the\nfact that it is not worth the expense involved in proving a\nstatutory remedy does not constitute the elimination of the right to pursue that remedy. Cf. Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp. , 500 U.S.\n20 , 32; Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky\nReefer , 515 U.S.\n528 , 530, 534. AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion , 563 U. S. ___, all but resolves this case.\nThere, in finding that a law that conditioned enforcement of\narbitration on the availability of class procedure interfered with\nfundamental arbitration attributes, id., at ___, the Court\nspecifically rejected the argument that class arbitration was\nnecessary to prosecute claims “that might otherwise slip\nthrough the legal system,” id., at ___.\nPp. 5–9. 667 F.3d 204, reversed. Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Thomas, and\nAlito, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion. Kagan,\nJ., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg and Breyer, JJ.,\njoined. Sotomayor, J., took no part in the consideration or\ndecision of the case.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 12–133 _________________ AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY, et al.,\nPETITIONERS v. ITALIAN COLORS RESTAURANT et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [June 20, 2013] Justice Scalia\ndelivered the opinion of the Court. We consider whether a\ncontractual waiver of class arbitration is enforceable under the\nFederal Arbitration Act when the plaintiff’s cost of\nindividually arbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the\npotential recovery. I Respondents are\nmerchants who accept American Express cards. Their agreement with\npetitioners—American Express and a wholly owned\nsubsidiary—contains a clause that requires all disputes\nbetween the parties to be resolved by arbitration. The agreement\nalso provides that “[t]here shall be no right or authority\nfor any Claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis.”\nIn re American Express Merchants’ Litigation, 667\nF. 3d 204, 209 (CA2 2012). Respondents brought a\nclass action against petitioners for violations of the federal\nantitrust laws. According to respondents, American Express used its\nmonopoly power in the market for charge cards to force merchants to\naccept credit cards at rates approximately 30% higher than the fees\nfor competing credit cards. [ 1 ] This tying arrangement, respondents said, violated §1 of the\nSherman Act. They sought treble damages for the class under §4\nof the Clayton Act. Petitioners moved to\ncompel individual arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act\n(FAA), 9 U. S. C. §1 et seq. In resisting the\nmotion, respondents submitted a declaration from an economist who\nestimated that the cost of an expert analysis necessary to prove\nthe antitrust claims would be “at least several hundred\nthousand dollars, and might exceed $1 million,” while the\nmaximum recovery for an individual plaintiff would be $12,850, or\n$38,549 when trebled. App. 93. The District Court granted the\nmotion and dismissed the lawsuits. The Court of Appeals reversed\nand remanded for further proceedings. It held that because\nrespondents had established that “they would incur\nprohibitive costs if compelled to arbitrate under the class action\nwaiver,” the waiver was un- enforceable and the arbitration\ncould not proceed. In re American Express Merchants’\nLitigation, 554 F. 3d 300, 315–316 (CA2 2009). We granted certiorari,\nvacated the judgment, and remanded for further consideration in\nlight of Stolt-Nielsen S. A. v. AnimalFeeds Int’l Corp.,\n559 U. S. 662 (2010) , which held that a party may not be\ncompelled to submit to class arbitration absent an agreement to do\nso. American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant, 559\nU. S. 1103 (2010) . The Court of Appeals stood by its\nreversal, stating that its earlier ruling did not compel class\narbitration. In re American Express Merchants’\nLitigation, 634 F. 3d 187, 200 (CA2 2011). It then\nsua sponte reconsidered its ruling in light of AT&T\nMobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U. S. ___ (2011), which held\nthat the FAA pre-empted a state law barring enforcement of a\nclass-arbitration waiver. Finding AT&T Mobility inapplicable\nbecause it addressed pre-emption, the Court of Appeals reversed for\nthe third time. 667 F. 3d, at 213. It then denied rehearing en\nbanc with five judges dissenting. In re American Express\nMerchants’ Litigation, 681 F. 3d 139 (CA2 2012). We\ngranted certiorari, 568 U. S. ___ (2012), to consider the\nquestion “[w]hether the Federal Arbitration Act permits\ncourts . . . to invalidate arbitration agreements on the\nground that they do not permit class arbitration of a federal-law\nclaim,” Pet. for Cert. i. II Congress enacted the\nFAA in response to widespread judicial hostility to arbitration.\nSee AT&T Mobility, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4). As relevant\nhere, the Act provides: “A written\nprovision in any maritime transaction or contract evidencing a\ntransaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a\ncontroversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction\n. . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save\nupon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation\nof any contract.” 9 U. S. C. §2. This text reflects the overarching principle\nthat arbitration is a matter of contract. See Rent-A-Center, West,\nInc. v. Jackson, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 3).\nAnd consistent with that text, courts must “rigorously\nenforce” arbitration agreements according to their terms,\nDean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, 470 U. S. 213, 221 (1985) ,\nincluding terms that “specify with whom [the parties] choose\nto arbitrate their disputes,” Stolt-Nielsen, supra, at 683,\nand “the rules under which that arbitration will be\nconducted,” Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of\nTrustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U. S. 468, 479\n(1989) . That holds true for claims that allege a violation of a\nfederal statute, unless the FAA’s mandate has been\n“ ‘overridden by a contrary congressional\ncommand.’ ” CompuCredit Corp. v. Greenwood, 565\nU. S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 2–3) (quoting\nShearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 226\n(1987) ). III No contrary\ncongressional command requires us to reject the waiver of class\narbitration here. Respondents argue that requiring them to litigate\ntheir claims individually—as they contracted to\ndo—would contravene the policies of the antitrust laws. But\nthe antitrust laws do not guarantee an affordable procedural path\nto the vindi- cation of every claim. Congress has taken some\nmeasures to facilitate the litigation of antitrust claims—for\nexample, it enacted a multiplied-damages remedy. See 15\nU. S. C. §15 (treble damages). In enacting such\nmeasures, Congress has told us that it is willing to go, in certain\nrespects, beyond the normal limits of law in advancing its goals of\ndeterring and remedying unlawful trade practice. But to say that\nCongress must have intended whatever departures from those normal\nlimits advance antitrust goals is simply irrational. “[N]o\nlegislation pursues its purposes at all costs.” Rodriguez v.\nUnited States, 480 U. S. 522 –526 (1987)\n(per curiam). The antitrust laws do\nnot “evinc[e] an intention to preclude a waiver” of\nclass-action procedure. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler\nChrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628 (1985) . The\nSherman and Clayton Acts make no mention of class actions. In fact,\nthey were enacted decades before the advent of Federal Rule of\nCivil Procedure 23, which was “designed to allow an exception\nto the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of\nthe individual named parties only.” Califano v. Yamasaki, 442\nU. S. 682 –701 (1979). The parties here agreed to\narbitrate pursuant to that “usual rule,” and it would\nbe remarkable for a court to erase that expectation. Nor does congressional\napproval of Rule 23 establish an entitlement to class proceedings\nfor the vindication of statutory rights. To begin with, it is\nlikely that such an entitlement, invalidating private arbitration\nagreements denying class adjudication, would be an\n“abridg[ment]” or modif[ication]” of a\n“substantive right” forbidden to the Rules, see 28\nU. S. C. §2072(b). But there is no evidence of such\nan entitlement in any event. The Rule imposes stringent\nrequirements for certification that in practice exclude most\nclaims. And we have specifically rejected the assertion that one of\nthose requirements (the class-notice requirement) must be dispensed\nwith because the “prohibitively high cost” of\ncompliance would “frustrate [plain- tiff’s] attempt to\nvindicate the policies underlying the antitrust” laws. Eisen\nv. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U. S. 156 –168,\n175–176 (1974). One might respond, perhaps, that federal law\nsecures a nonwaivable opportunity to vindicate federal policies by\nsatisfying the procedural strictures of Rule 23 or invoking some\nother informal class mechanism in arbitration. But we have already\nrejected that proposition in AT&T Mobility, 563 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 9). IV Our finding of no\n“contrary congressional command” does not end the case.\nRespondents invoke a judge-made exception to the FAA which, they\nsay, serves to harmonize competing federal policies by allowing\ncourts to invalidate agreements that prevent the “effective\nvindication” of a federal statutory right. Enforcing the\nwaiver of class arbitration bars effective vindication, respondents\ncontend, because they have no economic incentive to pursue their\nantitrust claims individually in arbitration. The “effective\nvindication” exception to which respondents allude originated\nas dictum in Mitsubishi Motors, where we expressed a willingness to\ninvalidate, on “public policy” grounds, arbitration\nagreements that “operat[e] . . . as a prospective\nwaiver of a party’s right to pursue statutory\nremedies.” 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19 (emphasis\nadded). Dismissing concerns that the arbitral forum was inadequate,\nwe said that “so long as the prospective litigant effectively\nmay vindicate its statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum,\nthe statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent\nfunction.” Id., at 637. Subsequent cases have similarly\nasserted the existence of an “effective vindication”\nexception, see, e.g., 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, 556 U. S.\n247 –274 (2009); Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500\nU. S. 20, 28 (1991) , but have similarly declined to apply it\nto invalidate the arbitration agreement at issue. [ 2 ] And we do so again\nhere. As we have described, the exception finds its origin in the\ndesire to prevent “prospective waiver of a party’s\nright to pursue statutory remedies,” Mitsubishi Motors,\nsupra, at 637, n. 19 (emphasis added). That would certainly\ncover a provision in an arbitration agreement forbidding the\nassertion of certain statutory rights. And it would perhaps cover\nfiling and administrative fees attached to arbitration that are so\nhigh as to make access to the forum impracticable. See Green Tree\nFinancial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U. S. 79, 90 (2000)\n(“It may well be that the existence of large arbitration\ncosts could preclude a litigant . . . from effectively\nvindicating her federal statutory rights”). But the fact that\nit is not worth the expense involved in proving a statutory remedy\ndoes not constitute the elimination of the right to pursue that\nremedy. See 681 F. 3d, at 147 (Jacobs, C. J., dissenting from\ndenial of rehearing en banc). [ 3 ] The class-action waiver merely limits arbitration to\nthe two contracting parties. It no more eliminates those\nparties’ right to pursue their statutory remedy than did\nfederal law before its adoption of the class action for legal\nrelief in 1938, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28\nU. S. C., p. 864 (1938 ed., Supp V); 7A C. Wright,\nA. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure\n§1752, p. 18 (3d ed. 2005). Or, to put it differently,\nthe individual suit that was considered adequate to assure\n“effective vindication” of a federal right before\nadoption of class-action procedures did not suddenly become\n“ineffective vindication” upon their adoption. [ 4 ] A pair of our cases\nbrings home the point. In Gilmer, supra, we had no qualms in\nenforcing a class waiver in an arbitration agreement even though\nthe federal statute at issue, the Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct, ex- pressly permitted collective actions. We said that\nstatutory permission did “ ‘not mean that\nindividual attempts at conciliation were intended to be\nbarred.’ ” Id., at 32. And in Vimar Seguros y\nReaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, 515 U. S. 528 (1995) , we\nheld that requiring arbitration in a foreign country was compatible\nwith the federal Carriage of Goods by Sea Act. That legislation\nprohibited any agreement\n“ ‘relieving’ ” or\n“ ‘lessening’ ” the liability of\na carrier for damaged goods, id., at 530, 534 (quoting 46\nU. S. C. App. §1303(8) (1988 ed.))—which is\nclose to codification of an “effective vindication”\nexception. The Court rejected the argument that the\n“inconvenience and costs of proceeding” abroad\n“lessen[ed]” the defendants’ liability, stating\nthat “[i]t would be unwieldy and unsupported by the terms or\npolicy of the statute to require courts to proceed case by case to\ntally the costs and burdens to particular plaintiffs in light of\ntheir means, the size of their claims, and the relative burden on\nthe carrier.” 515 U. S., at 532, 536. Such a\n“tally[ing] [of] the costs and burdens” is precisely\nwhat the dissent would impose upon federal courts here. Truth to tell, our\ndecision in AT&T Mobility all but resolves this case. There we\ninvalidated a law conditioning enforcement of arbitration on the\navailability of class procedure because that law\n“interfere[d] with fundamental attributes of\narbitration.” 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n“[T]he switch from bilateral to class arbitration,” we\nsaid, “sacrifices the principal advantage of\narbitration—its informality—and makes the process\nslower, more costly, and more likely to generate procedural morass\nthan final judgment.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14). We\nspecifically rejected the argument that class arbitration was\nnecessary to prosecute claims “that might otherwise slip\nthrough the legal system.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 17). [ 5 ] *  *  * The regime\nestablished by the Court of Appeals’ decision would\nrequire—before a plaintiff can be held to contractually\nagreed bilateral arbitration—that a federal court determine\n(and the parties litigate) the legal requirements for success on\nthe merits claim-by-claim and theory-by-theory, the evidence\nnecessary to meet those requirements, the cost of developing that\nevidence, and the damages that would be recovered in the event of\nsuccess. Such a preliminary litigating hurdle would undoubtedly\ndestroy the prospect of speedy resolution that arbitration in\ngeneral and bilateral arbitration in particular was meant to\nsecure. The FAA does not sanction such a judicially created\nsuperstructure. The judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals is reversed. It is so ordered. Justice Sotomayor took\nno part in the consideration or decision of this case. Notes 1 A charge card requires\nits holder to pay the full outstanding balance at the end of a\nbilling cycle; a credit card requires payment of only a portion,\nwith the balance subject to interest. 2 Contrary to the\ndissent’s claim, post, at 8–9, and n. 3 (opinion of\nKagan, J.), the Court in Mitsubishi Motors did not hold that\nfederal statutory claims are subject to arbitration so long as the\nclaimant may effectively vindicate his rights in the arbitral\nforum. The Court expressly stated that, “at this stage in the\nproceedings,” it had “no occasion to speculate”\non whether the arbitration agreement’s potential deprivation\nof a claimant’s right to pursue federal remedies may render\nthat agreement unenforceable. 473 U. S., at 637, n. 19.\nEven the Court of Appeals in this case recognized the relevant\nlanguage in Mitsubishi Motors as dicta. In re American Express\nMerchants’ Litigation, 667 F. 3d 204, 214 (CA2\n2012). 3 The dissent contends that\na class-action waiver may deny a party’s right to pursue\nstatutory remedies in the same way as a clause that bars a party\nfrom presenting economic testimony. See post, at 3, 9. That is a\nfalse comparison for several reasons: To begin with, it is not a\ngiven that such a clause would constitute an impermissible waiver;\nwe have never considered the point. But more importantly, such a\nclause, assuming it makes vindication of the claim impossible,\nmakes it impossible not just as a class action but even as an\nindividual claim. 4 Who can disagree with the\ndissent’s assertion that “the effective-vindication\nrule asks about the world today, not the world as it might have\nlooked when Congress passed a given statute”? Post, at 12.\nBut time does not change the meaning of effectiveness, making\nineffective vindication today what was effective vindication in the\npast. The dissent also says that the agreement bars other forms of\ncost sharing—existing before the Sherman Act—that could\nprovide effective vindication. See post, at 11–12, and\nn. 5. Petitioners denied that, and that is not what the Court\nof Appeals decision under review here held. It held that, because\nother forms of cost sharing were not economically feasible\n(“the only economically feasible means for . . .\nenforcing [respondents’] statutory rights is via a class\naction”), the class-action waiver was unenforceable. 667 F.\n3d, at 218 (emphasis added). (The dissent’s assertion to the\ncontrary cites not the opinion on appeal here, but an earlier\nopinion that was vacated. See In re American Express\nMerchants’ Litigation, 554 F. 3d 300 (CA2 2009), vacated\nand remanded, .) That is the conclusion we reject. 5 In dismissing AT&T\nMobility as a case involving pre-emption and not the\neffective-vindication exception, the dissent ignores what that case\nestablished—that the FAA’s command to enforce\narbitration agreements trumps any interest in ensuring the\nprosecution of low-value claims. The latter interest, we said, is\n“unrelated” to the FAA. 563 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 17). Accordingly, the FAA does, contrary to the\ndissent’s assertion, see post, at 5, favor the absence of\nlitigation when that is the consequence of a class-action waiver,\nsince its “ ‘principal purpose’ ”\nis the enforcement of arbitration agreements according to their\nterms. 563 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9–10) (quoting\nVolt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland\nStanford Junior Univ., ).",

YOUNG, DEPUTY\nCOMMISSIONER AND DIRECTOR, VIRGINIA DIVISION OF CHILD SUPPORT\nENFORCEMENT, et al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit No. 12–17. Argued February 20, 2013—Decided\nApril 29, 2013 Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\ngrants Virginia citizens access to all public records, but grants\nno such right to non-Virginians. Petitioners McBurney and Hurlbert,\ncitizens of States other than Virginia, filed records requests\nunder the Act. After each petitioner’s request was denied, they\nfiled a 42 U. S. C. §1983 suit seeking declaratory and\ninjunctive relief for violations of the Privileges and Immunities\nClause and, in Hurlbert’s case, the dormant Commerce Clause. The\nDistrict Court granted Virginia’s motion for summary judgment, and\nthe Fourth Circuit affirmed. Held : 1. Virginia’s FOIA does not violate the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause, which protects only those\nprivileges and immunities that are “fundamental.” See Baldwin v. Fish and Game Comm’n of Mont. , 436 U.S.\n371 , 382, 388. Pp. 3–12. (a) Hurlbert alleges that Virginia’s FOIA\nabridges his fundamental right to earn a living in his chosen\nprofession—obtaining property records on behalf of his clients.\nWhile the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects the right of\ncitizens to “ply their trade, practice their occupation, or pursue\na common calling,” Hicklin v. Orbeck , 437 U.S.\n518 , 524, the Court has struck down laws as violating this\nprivilege only when they were enacted for the protectionist purpose\nof burdening out-of-state citizens. See, e.g. , Toomer v. Witsell , 334 U.S.\n385 , 395, 397. The Virginia FOIA’s citizen/noncitizen\ndistinction has a nonprotectionist aim. Virginia’s FOIA exists to\nprovide a mechanism for Virginia citizens to obtain an accounting\nfrom their public officials; noncitizens have no comparable need.\nMoreover, the distinction between citizens and noncitizens\nrecognizes that citizens alone foot the bill for the fixed costs\nunderlying recordkeeping in the Commonwealth. Any effect the Act\nhas of preventing citizens of other States from making a profit by\ntrading on information contained in state records is incidental.\nPp. 4–6. (b) Hurlbert also alleges that Virginia’s\nFOIA abridges the right to own and transfer property in the\nCommonwealth. The right to take, hold, and dispose of property has\nlong been seen as one of the privileges of citizenship. See, e.g., Paul v. Virginia , 8 Wall. 168, 180. However,\nVirginia law does not prevent noncitizens from obtaining documents\nnecessary to the transfer of property. Records—like title and\nmortgage documents—maintained by the clerk of each circuit court\nare available to inspection by any person. Real estate tax\nassessment records are considered nonconfidential and are often\nposted online, a practice followed by the county from which\nHurlbert sought records. Requiring a noncitizen to obtain records\nthrough the clerk’s office or on the Internet, instead of through a\nburdensome FOIA process, cannot be said to impose a significant\nburden on the ability to own or transfer property in Virginia.\nPp. 6–8. (c) McBurney alleges that Virginia’s FOIA\nimpermissibly burdens his access to public proceedings. The\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause “secures citizens of one state the\nright to resort to the courts of another, equally with the citizens\nof the latter state,” Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co. , 257 U.S.\n533 , 535, but that “requirement is satisfied if the nonresident\nis given access . . . upon terms which . . .\nare reasonable and adequate for the enforcing of any rights he may\nhave, even though they may not be . . . the same in\nextent as those accorded to resident citizens,” Canadian\nNorthern R. Co. v. Eggen , 252 U.S.\n553 , 562. Virginia’s FOIA clearly does not deprive noncitizens\nof “reasonable and adequate” access to Commonwealth courts.\nVirginia’s court rules provide noncitizens access to nonpriviledged\ndocuments needed in litigation, and Virginia law gives citizens and\nnoncitizens alike access to judicial records and to records\npertaining directly to them. For example, McBurney utilized\nVirginia’s Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices\nAct to receive much of the information he had sought in his FOIA\nrequest. Pp. 8–10. (d) Petitioners’ sweeping claim that the\nVirginia FOIA violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause because\nit denies them the right to access public information on equal\nterms with Commonwealth citizens is rejected because the right to\naccess public information is not a “fundamental” privilege or\nimmunity of citizenship. The Court has repeatedly stated that the\nConstitution does not guarantee the existence of FOIA laws. See, e.g., Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting\nPublishing Corp. , 528 U.S.\n32 , 40. Moreover, no such right was recognized at common law or\nin the early Republic. Nor is such a sweeping right “basic to the\nmaintenance or well-being of the Union.” Baldwin, supra , at\n388. Pp. 10–12. 2. Virginia’s FOIA does not violate the\ndormant Commerce Clause. The “common thread” among this Court’s\ndormant Commerce Clause cases is that “the State interfered with\nthe natural functioning of the interstate market either through\nprohibition or thorough burdensome regulation.” Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp. , 426 U.S.\n794 , 806. Virginia’s FOIA, by contrast, neither prohibits\naccess to an interstate market nor imposes burdensome regulation on\nthat market. Accordingly, this is not properly viewed as a dormant\nCommerce Clause case. Even shoehorned into the Court’s dormant\nCommerce Clause framework, however, Hurlbert’s claim would fail.\nInsofar as there is a “market” for public documents in Virginia, it\nis a market for a product that the Commonwealth has created and of\nwhich the Commonwealth is the sole manufacturer. A State does not\nviolate the dormant Commerce Clause when, having created a market\nthrough a state program, it “limits benefits generated by [that]\nstate program to those who fund the state treasury and whom the\nState was created to serve.” Reeves, Inc. v. Stake , 447 U.S.\n429 , 442. Pp. 12–14. 667 F.3d 454, affirmed. Alito, J., delivered the opinion for a\nunanimous Court. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 12–17 _________________ MARK J. McBURNEY, et al., PETITIONERS v. NA- THANIEL L. YOUNG, DEPUTY COMMISSIONER AND DIRECTOR,\nVIRGINIA DIVISION OF CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT, et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fourth circuit [April 29, 2013] Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. In this case, we must decide whether the\nVirginia Freedom of Information Act, Va. Code Ann. §2.2–3700 et seq. , violates either the Privileges and Immunities\nClause of Article IV of the Constitution or the dormant Commerce\nClause. The Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), provides\nthat “all public records shall be open to inspection and copying by\nany citizens of the Commonwealth,” but it grants no such right to\nnon-Virginians. §2.2–3704(A) (Lexis 2011). Petitioners, who are citizens of other States,\nunsuccessfully sought information under the Act and then brought\nthis constitutional challenge. We hold, however, that petitioners’\nconstitutional rights were not violated. By means other than the\nstate FOIA, Virginia made available to petitioners most of the\ninformation that they sought, and the Commonwealth’s refusal to\nfurnish the additional information did not abridge any\nconstitutionally protected privilege or immunity. Nor did Virginia\nviolate the dor- mant Commerce Clause. The state Freedom of\nInforma- tion Act does not regulate commerce in any meaningful\nsense, but instead provides a service that is related to state\ncitizenship. For these reasons, we affirm the decision of the Court\nof Appeals rejecting petitioners’ constitutional claims. I Petitioners Mark J. McBurney and Roger W.\nHurlbert are citizens of Rhode Island and California respectively.\nMcBurney and Hurlbert each requested documents under the Virginia\nFOIA, but their requests were denied because of their\ncitizenship. McBurney is a former resident of Virginia whose\nex-wife is a Virginia citizen. After his ex-wife defaulted on her\nchild support obligations, McBurney asked the Commonwealth’s\nDivision of Child Support Enforcement to file a petition for child\nsupport on his behalf. The agency complied, but only after a\n9-month delay. McBurney attributes that delay to agency error and\nsays that it cost him nine months of child support. To ascertain\nthe reason for the agency’s delay, McBurney filed a Virginia FOIA\nrequest seeking “all emails, notes, files, memos, reports, letters,\npolicies, [and] opinions” pertaining to his family, along with all\ndocuments “regarding [his] application for child support” and all\ndocuments pertaining to the handling of child support claims like\nhis. App. in No. 11–1099 (CA4), p. 39A. The agency denied\nMcBurney’s request on the ground that he was not a Virginia\ncitizen. McBurney later requested the same documents under\nVirginia’s Gov- ernment Data Collection and Dissemination Practices\nAct, Va. Code Ann. §2.2–3800 et seq. , and through that\nre- quest he received most of the information he had sought that\npertained specifically to his own case. He did not, however,\nreceive any general policy information about how the agency handled\nclaims like his. Hurlbert is the sole proprietor of Sage\nInformation Services, a business that requests real estate tax\nrecords on clients’ behalf from state and local governments across\nthe United States. In 2008, Hurlbert was hired by a land/title\ncompany to obtain real estate tax records for properties in Henrico\nCounty, Virginia. He filed a Virginia FOIA request for the\ndocuments with the Henrico County Real Estate Assessor’s Office,\nbut his request was denied because he was not a Virginia\ncitizen. Petitioners filed suit under 42\nU. S. C. §1983, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief\nfor violations of the Privileges and Immunities Clause and, in\nHurlbert’s case, the dormant Commerce Clause. The District Court\ngranted Virginia’s motion for summary judgment, McBurney v. Cuccinelli , 780 F. Supp. 2d 439 (ED Va. 2011), and the Court\nof Appeals affirmed, 667 F.3d 454 (CA4 2012). Like Virginia, several other States have enacted\nfreedom of information laws that are available only to their\ncitizens. See, e.g., Ala. Code §36–12–40 (2012 Cum. Supp.);\nArk. Code Ann. §25–19–105 (2011 Supp.); Del. Code Ann., Tit. 29,\n§10003 (2012 Supp.); Mo. Rev. Stat. §109.180 (2012); N. H.\nRev. Stat. Ann. §91–A:4 (West 2012); N. J. Stat. Ann. §47:1A–1\n(West 2003); Tenn. Code Ann. §10–7–503 (2012). In Lee v. Minner , 458 F.3d 194 (2006), the Third Circuit held that\nthis feature of Delaware’s FOIA violated the Privileges and\nImmunities Clause. We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.\n568 U. S. ___ (2012). II Under the Privileges and Immunities Clause,\n“[t]he Citizens of each State [are] entitled to all Privileges and\nImmunities of Citizens in the several States.” U. S. Const.,\nArt. IV, §2, cl. 1. We have said that “[t]he object of\nthe Privileges and Immunities Clause is to ‘strongly\n. . . constitute the citizens of the United States [as]\none people,’ by ‘plac[ing] the citizens of each State upon the same\nfooting with citizens of other States, so far as the advantages\nresulting from citizenship in those States are concerned.’ ” Lunding v. New York Tax Appeals Tribunal , 522 U.S.\n287 , 296 (1998) (quoting Paul v. Virginia , 8\nWall. 168, 180 (1869)). This does not mean, we have cautioned, that\n“state citizenship or residency may never be used by a State to\ndistinguish among persons.” Baldwin v. Fish and Game\nComm’n of Mont. , 436 U.S.\n371 , 383 (1978). “Nor must a State always apply all its laws or\nall its services equally to anyone, resident or nonresident, who\nmay request it so to do.” Ibid . Rather, we have long held\nthat the Privileges and Immunities Clause protects only those\nprivileges and immunities that are “fundamental.” See, e.g.,\nid. , at 382, 388. Petitioners allege that Virginia’s citizens-only\nFOIA provision violates four different “fundamental” privileges or\nimmunities: the opportunity to pursue a common calling, the ability\nto own and transfer property, access to the Virginia courts, and\naccess to public information. The first three items on that list,\nhowever, are not abridged by the Virginia FOIA, and the\nfourth—framed broadly—is not protected by the Privileges and\nImmunities Clause. A Hurlbert argues that Virginia’s citizens-only\nFOIA pro- vision abridges his ability to earn a living in his\nchosen profession, namely, obtaining property records from state\nand local governments on behalf of clients. He is correct that the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause protects the right of citizens to\n“ply their trade, practice their occupation, or pursue a common\ncalling.” Hicklin v. Orbeck , 437\nU.S. 518 , 524 (1978); Supreme Court of N. H. v. Piper , 470 U.S.\n274 , 280 (1985) (“ ‘[O]ne of the privileges which the\nClause guarantees to citizens of State A is that of doing business\nin State B on terms of substantial equality with the citizens of\nthat State’ ”). But the Virginia FOIA does not abridge\nHulbert’s ability to engage in a common calling in the sense\nprohibited by the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Rather, the\nCourt has struck laws down as violating the privilege of pursuing a\ncommon calling only when those laws were enacted for the\nprotectionist purpose of burdening out-of-state citizens. See, e.g. , Hicklin , supra , (striking down as a\nviolation of noncitizens’ privileges and immunities an “Alaska\nHire” statute containing a resident hiring preference for all\nemployment related to the development of the State’s oil and gas\nresources); Toomer v. Witsell , 334 U.S.\n385 , 395, 397 (1948) (striking down a South Carolina statute\nimposing a $2,500 license fee on out-of-state shrimping boats and\nonly a $25 fee on in-state shrimping boats where petitioners\nalleged that the “purpose and effect of this statute . . . [was]\nnot to conserve shrimp, but to exclude non-residents and thereby\ncreate a commercial monopoly for South Carolina residents,” and the\n“record cas[t] some doubt on” the State’s counterassertion that the\nstatute’s “obvious purpose was to conserve its shrimp supply”); United Building & Constr. Trades Council of Camden Cty. v. Mayor and Council of Camden , 465\nU.S. 208 (1984) (New Jersey municipal ordinance requiring that\nat least 40% of employees of contractors and subcontractors working\non city construction projects be city residents facially burdened\nout-of-state citizens’ ability to pursue a common calling). In each\ncase, the clear aim of the statute at issue was to advantage\nin-state workers and commercial interests at the expense of their\nout-of-state counterparts. Virginia’s FOIA differs sharply from those\nstatutes. By its own terms, Virginia’s FOIA was enacted to\n“ensur[e] the people of the Commonwealth ready access to public\nrecords in the custody of a public body or its officers and\nemployees, and free entry to meetings of public bodies wherein the\nbusiness of the people is being conducted.” Va. Code Ann.\n§2.2–3700(B) (Lexis 2011). Hurlbert does not allege—and has offered\nno proof—that the challenged provision of the Virginia FOIA was\nenacted in order to provide a competitive economic advantage for\nVirginia citizens. Cf. Hillside Dairy Inc. v. Lyons , 539 U.S.\n59 , 67 (2003) (piercing a professedly nondiscriminatory statute\nto find economic protectionism). Rather, it seems clear that the\ndistinction that the statute makes between citizens and noncitizens\nhas a distinctly nonprotectionist aim. The state FOIA essentially\nrepresents a mechanism by which those who ultimately hold sovereign\npower ( i.e. , the citizens of the Commonwealth) may obtain an\naccounting from the public officials to whom they delegate the\nexercise of that power. See Va. Const., Art. I, §2; Va. Code Ann.\n§2.2–3700(B). In addition, the provision limiting the use of the\nstate FOIA to Virginia citizens recognizes that Virginia taxpayers\nfoot the bill for the fixed costs underlying recordkeeping in the\nCommonwealth. Tr. of Oral Arg. 53–54. The challenged provision of\nthe state FOIA does not violate the Privileges and Immunities\nClause simply because it has the incidental effect of preventing\ncitizens of other States from making a profit by trading on in-\nformation contained in state records. While the Clause forbids a\nState from intentionally giving its own citizens a competitive\nadvantage in business or employment, the Clause does not require\nthat a State tailor its every action to avoid any incidental effect\non out-of-state tradesmen. B Hurlbert next alleges that the challenged\nprovision of the Virginia FOIA abridges the right to own and\ntransfer property in the Commonwealth. Like the right to pursue a\ncommon calling, the right to “take, hold and dispose of property,\neither real or personal,” has long been seen as one of the\nprivileges of citizenship. See Corfield v. Coryell , 6\nF. Cas. 546, 552 (No. 3, 230) (CCED Pa. 1825); see also Paul , supra , at 180 (listing “the acquisition and\nenjoyment of property” among the privileges of citizenship). Thus,\nif a State prevented out-of-state citizens from accessing\nrecords—like title documents and mortgage records—that are\nnecessary to the transfer of property, the State might well run\nafoul of the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Cf. State v. Grimes , 29 Nev. 50, 85, 84 P. 1061, 1073 (1906) (“ Caveat\nemptor being the rule with us in the absence of a special\nagreement, it is just and essential to the protection of persons\nintending to purchase or take incumbrances that they be allowed the\nright of inspection”); Jackson ex dem. Center v. Campbell , 19 Johns. 281, 283 (N. Y. 1822) (the “plain\nintention” of the State’s property records system was “to give\nnotice, through the medium of the county records, to persons about\nto purchase”). Virginia, however, does not prevent citizens of\nother States from obtaining such documents. Under Virginia law,\n“any records and papers of every circuit court that are maintained\nby the clerk of the circuit court shall be open to inspection by\nany person and the clerk shall, when requested, furnish copies\nthereof.” Va. Code Ann. §17.1–208 (Lexis 2010). Such records and\npapers include records of property transfers, like title documents,\n§55–106 (Lexis 2012); notices of federal tax liens and other\nfederal liens against property, §55–142.1; notices of state tax\nliens against property, §58.1–314 (Lexis 2009) (state taxes\ngenerally), §58.1–908 (estate tax liens), §58.1–1805 (state taxes\ngenerally), §58.1–2021(A) (liens filed by agencies other than the\nTax Commission); and notice of mortgages and other encumbrances,\n§8.01–241 (Lexis Supp. 2012). A similar flaw undermines Hurlbert’s claim that\nVir- ginia violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause by pre-\nventing citizens of other States from accessing real estate tax\nassessment records. It is true that those records, while available\nto Virginia citizens under the state FOIA, are not required by\nstatute to be made available to noncitizens. See Associated Tax\nService, Inc. v. Fitzpatrick , 236 Va. 181, 183, 187, 372 S.E.2d 625 , 627, 629 (1988).[ 1 ] But in fact Virginia and its subdivisions generally\nmake even these less essential records readily available to all.\nThese records are considered nonconfidential under Virginia law\nand, accordingly, they may be posted online. §58.1–3122.2 (Lexis\n2009). Henrico County, from which Hurlbert sought real estate tax\nassessments, follows this practice,[ 2 ] as does almost every other county in the Commonwealth.\nRequiring noncitizens to conduct a few minutes of Internet research\nin lieu of using a relatively cumbersome state FOIA process cannot\nbe said to impose any significant burden on noncitizens’ ability to\nown or transfer property in Virginia. C McBurney alleges that Virginia’s citizens-only\nFOIA provision impermissibly burdens his “access to public\nproceedings.” Brief for Petitioners 42. McBurney is correct that\nthe Privileges and Immunities Clause “secures citizens of one State\nthe right to resort to the courts of another, equally with the\ncitizens of the latter State.” Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Clarendon Boat Oar Co. , 257 U.S.\n533 , 535 (1922). But petitioners do not suggest that the\nVirginia FOIA slams the courthouse door on noncitizens; rather, the\nmost they claim is that the law creates “[a]n information asymmetry\nbetween adversaries based solely on state citizenship.” Brief for\nPetitioners 42. The Privileges and Immunities Clause does not\nrequire States to erase any distinction between citizens and\nnon-citizens that might conceivably give state citizens some\ndetectable litigation advantage. Rather, the Court has made clear\nthat “the constitutional requirement is sat- isfied if the\nnon-resident is given access to the courts of the State upon terms\nwhich in themselves are reasonable and adequate for the enforcing\nof any rights he may have, even though they may not be technically\nand precisely the same in extent as those accorded to resident\ncitizens.” Canadian Northern R. Co. v. Eggen , 252 U.S.\n553 , 562 (1920). The challenged provision of the Virginia FOIA\nclearly does not deprive noncitizens of “reasonable and adequate”\naccess to the Commonwealth’s courts. Virginia’s rules of civil\nprocedure provide for both discovery, Va. Sup. Ct. Rule 4:1 (2012),\nand subpoenas duces tecum , Rule 4:9. There is no reason to\nthink that those mechanisms are insufficient to provide noncitizens\nwith any relevant, nonprivileged documents needed in\nlitigation. Moreover, Virginia law gives citizens and\nnoncitizens alike access to judicial records. Va. Code Ann.\n§17.1–208; see also Shenandoah Publishing House, Inc. v. Fanning , 235 Va. 253, 258, 368 S.E.2d 253 , 256 (1988). And if Virginia has in its\npossession information about any person, whether a citizen of the\nCommonwealth or of another State, that person has the right under\nthe Government Data Collection and Dissemination Practices Act to\ninspect that information. §2.2–3806(A)(3) (Lexis 2011). McBurney’s own case is illustrative. When his\nFOIA request was denied, McBurney was told that he should request\nthe materials he sought pursuant to the Government Data Collection\nand Dissemination Practices Act. Upon placing a request under that\nAct, he ultimately received much of what he sought. Accordingly,\nVirginia’s citizens-only FOIA provision does not impermissibly\nburden noncitizens’ ability to access the Commonwealth’s\ncourts. D Finally, we reject petitioners’ sweeping claim\nthat the challenged provision of the Virginia FOIA violates the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause because it denies them the right\nto access public information on equal terms with citizens of the\nCommonwealth. We cannot agree that the Privileges and Immunities\nClause covers this broad right. This Court has repeatedly made clear that there\nis no constitutional right to obtain all the information provided\nby FOIA laws. See Houchins v. KQED, Inc. , 438 U.S.\n1 , 14 (1978) (plurality opinion) (“ ‘The Constitution\nitself is [not] a Freedom of Information Act’ ”); see also Los Angeles Police Dept. v. United Reporting Publishing\nCorp. , 528 U.S.\n32 , 40 (1999) (the Government could decide “not to give out\n[this] information at all”); Sorrell v. IMS Health\nInc. , 564 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (Breyer, J., dissenting)\n(slip op., at 8) (“[T]his Court has never found that the First Amendment prohibits the government from restricting\nthe use of information gathered pursuant to a regulatory\nmandate”). It certainly cannot be said that such a broad\nright has “at all times, been enjoyed by the citizens of the\nseveral states which compose this Union, from the time of their\nbecoming free, independent, and sovereign.” Corfield , 6\nF. Cas., at 551. No such right was recognized at common law.\nSee H. Cross, The People’s Right to Know 25 (1953) (“[T]he courts\ndeclared the primary rule that there was no general common law\nright in all persons (as citizens, taxpayers, electors or merely as\npersons) to inspect public records or documents”). Most\nfounding-era English cases provided that only those persons who had\na personal interest in non-judicial records were permitted to\naccess them. See, e.g., King v. Shelley , 3 T. R. 141,\n142, 100 Eng. Rep. 498, 499 (K. B. 1789) (Buller, J.) (“[O]ne man\nhas no right to look into another’s title deeds and records, when\nhe . . . has no interest in the deeds or rolls himself”); King v. Justices of Staffordshire , 6 Ad. & E. 84,\n101, 112 Eng. Rep. 33, 39 (K. B. 1837) (“The utmost . . . that can\nbe said on the ground of interest, is that the applicants have a\nrational curiosity to gratify by this inspection, or that they may\nthereby ascertain facts useful to them in advancing some ulterior\nmeasures in contemplation as to regulating county expenditure; but\nthis is merely an interest in obtaining information on the general\nsubject, and would furnish an equally good reason for permitting\ninspection of the records of any other county: there is not that\ndirect and tangible interest, which is necessary to bring them\nwithin the rule on which the Court acts in granting inspection of\npublic documents”). Nineteenth-century American cases, while less\nuniform, certainly do not support the proposition that a\nbroad-based right to access public information was widely\nrecognized in the early Republic. See, e.g., Cormack v. Wolcott , 37 Kan. 391, 394, 15 P. 245, 246 (1887) (denying\nmandamus to plaintiff seeking to compile abstracts of title\nrecords; “At common law, parties had no vested rights in the\nexamination of a record of title, or other public records, save by\nsome interest in the land or subject of record”); Brewer v. Watson , 71 Ala. 299, 305 (1882) (“The individual demanding\naccess to, and inspection of public writings must not only have an\ninterest in the matters to which they relate, a direct, tangible\ninterest, but the inspection must be sought for some specific and\nlegitimate purpose. The gratification of mere curiosity, or motives\nmerely speculative will not entitle him to demand an examination of\nsuch writings”); Nadel, What are “Records” of Agency Which Must Be\nMade Available Under State Freedom of Information Act, 27 A. L. R.\n4th 680, 687, §2[b] (1984) (“[A]t common law, a person requesting\ninspection of a public record was required to show an interest\ntherein which would enable him to maintain or defend an action for\nwhich the document or record sought could furnish evidence or\nnecessary information”). Nor is such a sweeping right “basic to the\nmaintenance or well-being of the Union.” Baldwin , 436\nU. S., at 388. FOIA laws are of relatively recent vintage. The\nfederal FOIA was enacted in 1966, §1, 80Stat. 383, and Virginia’s\ncounterpart was adopted two years later, 1968 Va. Acts ch. 479, p.\n690. There is no contention that the Nation’s unity foundered in\ntheir absence, or that it is suffering now because of the\ncitizens-only FOIA provisions that several States have enacted. III In addition to his Privileges and Immunities\nClause claim, Hurlbert contends that Virginia’s citizens-only FOIA\nprovision violates the dormant Commerce Clause. The Commerce Clause\nempowers Congress “[t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several\nStates.” Art. I, §8, cl. 3. The Commerce Clause does not\nexpressly impose any constraints on “the several States,” and\nseveral Members of the Court have expressed the view that it does\nnot do so. See General Motors Corp. v. Tracy , 519 U.S.\n278 , 312 (1997) (Scalia, J., concurring) (“[T]he so-called\n‘negative’ Commerce Clause is an unjustified judicial intervention,\nnot to be expanded beyond its existing domain”); United Haulers\nAssn . Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management\nAuthority , 550 U.S.\n330 , 349 (2007) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (“The\nnegative Commerce Clause has no basis in the Constitution and has\nproved unwork- able in practice”). Nonetheless, the Court has long\ninferred that the Commerce Clause itself imposes certain implicit\nlimitations on state power. See, e.g., Cooley v. Board of\nWardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief\nof Distressed Pilots , 12 How. 299, 318–319 (1852); cf. Gib-\nbons v. Ogden , 9 Wheat. 1, 209 (1824) (Marshall,\nC. J.) (dictum). Our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence\n“significantly limits the ability of States and localities to\nregulate or otherwise burden the flow of interstate commerce.” Maine v. Taylor , 477 U.S.\n131 , 151 (1986). It is driven by a concern about “economic\nprotectionism—that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit\nin-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors.” New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach , 486 U.S.\n269 , 273–274 (1988); see also Philadelphia v. New\nJersey , 437 U.S.\n617 , 624 (1978) (“The crucial inquiry . . . must be directed to\ndetermining whether [the challenged statute] is basically a\nprotectionist measure, or whether it can fairly be viewed as a law\ndirected to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon interstate\ncommerce that are only incidental”). Virginia’s FOIA law neither “regulates” nor\n“burdens” interstate commerce; rather, it merely provides a service\nto local citizens that would not otherwise be available at all. The\n“common thread” among those cases in which the Court has found a\ndormant Commerce Clause violation is that “the State interfered\nwith the natural functioning of the interstate market either\nthrough prohibition or through burdensome regulation.” Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp. , 426 U.S.\n794 , 806 (1976). Here, by contrast, Virginia neither prohibits\naccess to an interstate market nor imposes burdensome regulation on\nthat market. Rather, it merely creates and provides to its own\ncitizens copies—which would not otherwise exist—of state records.\nAs discussed above, the express purpose of Virginia’s FOIA law is\nto “ensur[e] the people of the Commonwealth ready access to public\nrecords in the custody of a public body or its officers and\nemployees, and free entry to meetings of public bodies wherein the\nbusiness of the people is being conducted.” Va. Code Ann.\n§2.2–3700(B). This case is thus most properly brought under the\nPrivileges and Immunities Clause: It quite literally poses the\nquestion whether Virginia can deny out-of-state citizens a benefit\nthat it has conferred on its own citizens. Cf . Missouri Pacific\nR. Co. , 257 U. S., at 535 (analyzing whether the\nprivilege of access to a State’s courts must be made available to\nout-of-state citizens equally with the citizens of the relevant\nState). Because it does not pose the question of the\nconstitutionality of a state law that interferes with an interstate\nmarket through prohibition or burdensome regulations, this case is\nnot governed by the dormant Commerce Clause. Even shoehorned into our dormant Commerce Clause\nframework, however, Hurlbert’s claim would fail. Insofar as there\nis a “market” for public documents in Virginia, it is a market for\na product that the Commonwealth has created and of which the\nCommonwealth is the sole manufacturer. We have held that a State\ndoes not violate the dormant Commerce Clause when, having created a\nmarket through a state program, it “limits benefits generated by\n[that] state program to those who fund the state treasury and whom\nthe State was created to serve.” Reeves, Inc. v. Stake , 447 U.S.\n429 , 442 (1980). “Such policies, while perhaps ‘protectionist’\nin a loose sense, reflect the essential and patently\nunobjectionable purpose of state government—to serve the citizens\nof the State.” Ibid. ; cf . Department of Revenue of\nKy. v. Davis , 553 U.S.\n328 , 341 (2008) (“[A] government function is not susceptible to\nstandard dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny owing to its likely\nmotivation by legitimate objectives distinct from the simple\neconomic protectionism the Clause abhors”). For these reasons,\nVirginia’s citizens-only FOIA provision does not violate the\ndormant Commerce Clause. *  *  * Because Virginia’s citizens-only FOIA\nprovision neither abridges any of petitioners’ fundamental\nprivileges and immunities nor impermissibly regulates commerce,\npetitioners’ constitutional claims",

GALLOWAY\net al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit No. 12–696. Argued November 6,\n2013—Decided May 5, 2014 Since 1999, the monthly town board meetings in\nGreece, New York, have opened with a roll call, a recitation of the\nPledge of Allegiance, and a prayer given by clergy selected from\nthe congregations listed in a local directory. While the prayer\nprogram is open to all creeds, nearly all of the local\ncongregations are Christian; thus, nearly all of the participating\nprayer givers have been too. Respondents, citizens who attend\nmeetings to speak on local issues, filed suit, alleging that the\ntown violated the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause by\npreferring Christians over other prayer givers and by sponsoring\nsectarian prayers. They sought to limit the town to\n“inclusive and ecumenical” prayers that referred only\nto a “generic God.” The District Court upheld the\nprayer practice on summary judgment, finding no impermissible\npreference for Christianity; concluding that the Christian identity\nof most of the prayer givers reflected the predominantly Christian\ncharacter of the town’s congregations, not an official policy\nor practice of discriminating against minority faiths; finding that\nthe First Amendment did not require Greece to invite clergy from\ncongregations beyond its borders to achieve religious diversity;\nand rejecting the theory that legislative prayer must be\nnonsectarian. The Second Circuit reversed, holding that some\naspects of the prayer program, viewed in their totality by a\nreasonable observer, conveyed the message that Greece was endorsing\nChristianity. Held: The judgment is\nreversed. 681 F.3d 20, reversed. Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, except as to Part II–B, concluding that the\ntown’s prayer practice does not violate the Establishment\nClause. Pp. 6–18. (a) Legislative prayer, while religious\nin nature, has long been understood as compatible with the\nEstablishment Clause. Marsh v. Chambers , 463 U.S.\n783 , 792. In Marsh , the Court concluded that it was not\nnecessary to define the Establishment Clause’s precise\nboundary in order to uphold Nebraska’s practice of employing\na legislative chaplain because history supported the conclusion\nthat the specific practice was permitted. The First Congress voted\nto appoint and pay official chaplains shortly after approving\nlanguage for the First Amendment, and both Houses have maintained\nthe office virtually uninterrupted since then. See id. , at\n787–789, and n. 10. A majority of the States have also\nhad a consistent practice of legislative prayer. Id., at\n788–790, and n. 11. There is historical precedent for\nthe practice of opening local legislative meetings with prayer as\nwell. Marsh teaches that the Establishment Clause must be\ninterpreted “by reference to historical practices and\nunderstandings.” County of Allegheny v. American\nCivil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter , 492 U.S.\n573 , 670 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Thus, any test must\nacknowledge a practice that was accepted by the Framers and has\nwithstood the critical scrutiny of time and political change. The\nCourt’s inquiry, then, must be to determine whether the\nprayer practice in the town of Greece fits within the tradition\nlong followed in Congress and the state legislatures.\nPp. 6–9. (b) Respondents’ insistence on\nnonsectarian prayer is not consistent with this tradition. The\nprayers in Marsh were consistent with the First Amendment\nnot because they espoused only a generic theism but because the\nNation’s history and tradition have shown that prayer in this\nlimited context could “coexis[t] with the principles of\ndisestablishment and religious freedom.” 463 U. S., at\n786. Dictum in County of Allegheny suggesting that Marsh permitted only prayer with no overtly Christian\nreferences is irreconcilable with the facts, holding, and reasoning\nof Marsh , which instructed that the “content of the\nprayer is not of concern to judges,” provided “there is\nno indication that the prayer opportunity has been exploited to\nproselytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or\nbelief.” 463 U. S., at 794–795. To hold that\ninvocations must be nonsectarian would force the legislatures\nsponsoring prayers and the courts deciding these cases to act as\nsupervisors and censors of religious speech, thus involving\ngovernment in religious matters to a far greater degree than is the\ncase under the town’s current practice of neither editing nor\napproving prayers in advance nor criticizing their content after\nthe fact. Respondents’ contrary arguments are unpersuasive.\nIt is doubtful that consensus could be reached as to what qualifies\nas a generic or nonsectarian prayer. It would also be unwise to\nconclude that only those religious words acceptable to the majority\nare permis-sible, for the First Amendment is not a majority rule\nand government may not seek to define permissible categories of\nreligious speech. In rejecting the suggestion that legislative\nprayer must be nonsectarian, the Court does not imply that no\nconstraints remain on its content. The relevant constraint derives\nfrom the prayer’s place at the opening of legislative\nsessions, where it is meant to lend gravity to the occasion and\nreflect values long part of the Nation’s heritage. From the\nNation’s earliest days, invocations have been addressed to\nassemblies comprising many different creeds, striving for the idea\nthat people of many faiths may be united in a community of\ntolerance and devotion, even if they disagree as to religious\ndoctrine. The prayers delivered in Greece do not fall outside this\ntradition. They may have invoked, e.g., the name of Jesus,\nbut they also invoked universal themes, e.g., by calling for\na “spirit of cooperation.” Absent a pattern of prayers\nthat over time denigrate, proselytize, or betray an impermissible\ngovernment purpose, a challenge based solely on the content of a\nparticular prayer will not likely establish a constitutional\nviolation. See 463 U. S., at 794–795. Finally, so long\nas the town maintains a policy of nondiscrimination, the\nConstitution does not require it to search beyond its borders for\nnon-Christian prayer givers in an effort to achieve religious\nbalancing. Pp. 9–18. Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice\nand Justice Alito, concluded in Part II–B that a\nfact-sensitive inquiry that considers both the setting in which the\nprayer arises and the audience to whom it is directed shows that\nthe town is not coercing its citizens to engage in a religious\nobservance. The prayer opportunity is evaluated against the\nbackdrop of a historical practice showing that prayer has become\npart of the Nation’s heritage and tradition. It is presumed\nthat the reasonable observer is acquainted with this tradition and\nunderstands that its purposes are to lend gravity to public\nproceedings and to acknowledge the place religion holds in the\nlives of many private citizens. Furthermore, the principal audience\nfor these invocations is not the public, but the lawmakers\nthemselves. And those lawmakers did not direct the public to\nparticipate, single out dissidents for opprobrium, or indicate that\ntheir decisions might be influenced by a person’s\nacquiescence in the prayer opportunity. Respondents claim that the\nprayers gave them offense and made them feel excluded and\ndisrespected, but offense does not equate to coercion. In contrast\nto Lee v. Weisman , 505 U.S.\n577 , where the Court found coercive a religious invocation at a\nhigh school graduation, id., at 592–594, the record\nhere does not suggest that citizens are dissuaded from leaving the\nmeeting room during the prayer, arriving late, or making a later\nprotest. That the prayer in Greece is delivered during the opening\nceremonial portion of the town’s meeting, not the\npolicymaking portion, also suggests that its purpose and effect are\nto acknowledge religious leaders and their institutions, not to\nexclude or coerce nonbelievers. Pp. 18–23. Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia as to\nPart II, agreed that the town’s prayer practice does not\nviolate the Establishment Clause, but concluded that, even if the\nEstablishment Clause were properly incorporated against the States\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, the Clause is not violated by the\nkind of subtle pressures respondents allegedly suffered, which do\nnot amount to actual legal coercion. The municipal prayers in this\ncase bear no resemblance to the coercive state establishments that\nexisted at the founding, which exercised government power in order\nto exact financial support of the church, compel religious\nobservance, or control religious doctrine. Pp. 1–8. Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, except as to Part II–B. Roberts, C. J., and\nAlito, J., joined the opinion in full, and Scalia and Thomas, JJ.,\njoined except as to Part II–B. Alito, J., filed a concurring\nopinion, in which Scalia, J., joined. Thomas, J., filed an opinion\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Scalia,\nJ., joined as to Part II. Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nKagan, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, Breyer,\nand Sotomayor, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 12–696 _________________ TOWN OF GREECE, NEW YORK, PETITIONER v.SUSAN\nGALLOWAY et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [May 5, 2014] Justice Kennedy\ndelivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part\nII–B.[ 1 ]* The Court must decide\nwhether the town of Greece, New York, imposes an impermissible\nestablishment of religion by opening its monthly board meetings\nwith a prayer. It must be concluded, consistent with the\nCourt’s opinion in Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U. S. 783\n(1983) , that no violation of the Constitution has been shown. I Greece, a town with a\npopulation of 94,000, is in upstate New York. For some years, it\nbegan its monthly town board meetings with a moment of silence. In\n1999, the newly elected town supervisor, John Auberger, decided to\nreplicate the prayer practice he had found meaningful while serving\nin the county legislature. Following the roll call and recitation\nof the Pledge of Allegiance, Auberger would invite a local\nclergyman to the front of the room to deliver an invocation. After\nthe prayer, Auberger would thank the minister for serving as the\nboard’s “chaplain for the month” and present him\nwith a commemorative plaque. The prayer was intended to place town\nboard members in a solemn and deliberative frame of mind, invoke\ndivine guidance in town affairs, and follow a tradition practiced\nby Congress and dozens of state legislatures. App.\n22a–25a. The town followed an\ninformal method for selecting prayer givers, all of whom were\nunpaid volunteers. A town employee would call the congregations\nlisted in a local directory until she found a minister available\nfor that month’s meeting. The town eventually compiled a list\nof willing “board chaplains” who had accepted\ninvitations and agreed to return in the future. The town at no\npoint excluded or denied an opportunity to a would-be prayer giver.\nIts leaders maintained that a minister or layperson of any\npersuasion, including an atheist, could give the invocation. But\nnearly all of the congregations in town were Christian; and from\n1999 to 2007, all of the participating ministers were too. Greece neither reviewed\nthe prayers in advance of the meetings nor provided guidance as to\ntheir tone or content, in the belief that exercising any degree of\ncontrol over the prayers would infringe both the free exercise and\nspeech rights of the ministers. Id., at 22a. The town instead left\nthe guest clergy free to compose their own devotions. The resulting\nprayers often sounded both civic and religious themes. Typical were\ninvocations that asked the divinity to abide at the meeting and\nbestow blessings on the community: “Lord we ask you to send your spirit\nof servanthood upon all of us gathered here this evening to do your\nwork for the benefit of all in our community. We ask you to bless\nour elected and appointed officials so they may deliberate with\nwisdom and act with courage. Bless the members of our community who\ncome here to speak before the board so they may state their cause\nwith honesty and humility. . . . Lord we ask you to\nbless us all, that everything we do here tonight will move you to\nwelcome us one day into your kingdom as good and faithful servants.\nWe ask this in the name of our brother Jesus. Amen.” Id., at\n45a. Some of the ministers spoke in a distinctly\nChristian idiom; and a minority invoked religious holidays,\nscripture, or doctrine, as in the following prayer: “Lord, God of all creation, we give\nyou thanks and praise for your presence and action in the world. We\nlook with anticipation to the celebration of Holy Week and Easter.\nIt is in the solemn events of next week that we find the very heart\nand center of our Christian faith. We acknowledge the saving\nsacrifice ofJesus Christ on the cross. We draw strength, vitality,\nand confidence from his resurrection at\nEaster. . . . We pray for peace in the world, an end\nto terrorism, violence, conflict, and war. We pray for stability,\ndemocracy, and good government in those countries in which our\narmed forces are now serving, especially in Iraq and\nAfghanistan. . . . Praise and glory be yours, O\nLord, now and forever more. Amen.” Id., at 88a–89a. Respondents Susan\nGalloway and Linda Stephens attended town board meetings to speak\nabout issues of local concern, and they objected that the prayers\nviolated their religious or philosophical views. At one meeting,\nGalloway admonished board members that she foundthe prayers\n“offensive,” “intolerable,” and an affront\nto a “diverse community.” Complaint in No.\n08–cv–6088 (WDNY), ¶66. After respondents\ncomplained that Christian themes pervaded the prayers, to the\nexclusion of citizens who did not share those beliefs, the town\ninvited a Jewish layman and the chairman of the local Baha’i\ntemple to deliver prayers. A Wiccan priestess who had read press\nreports about the prayer controversy requested, and was granted, an\nopportunity to give the invocation. Galloway and Stephens\nbrought suit in the United States District Court for the Western\nDistrict of New York. They alleged that the town violated the First\nAmendment’s Establishment Clause by preferring Christians\nover other prayer givers and by sponsoring sectarian prayers, such\nas those given “in Jesus’ name.” 732\nF. Supp. 2d 195, 203 (2010). They did not seek an end to the\nprayer practice, but rather requested an injunction that would\nlimit the town to “inclusive and ecumenical” prayers\nthat referred only to a “generic God” and would not\nassociate the government with any one faith or belief. Id., at 210,\n241. The District Court on\nsummary judgment upheld the prayer practice as consistent with the\nFirst Amendment. It found no impermissible preference for\nChristianity, noting that the town had opened the prayer program to\nall creeds and excluded none. Although most of the prayer givers\nwere Christian, this fact reflected only the predominantly\nChristian identity of the town’s congregations, rather than\nan official policy or practice of discriminating against minority\nfaiths. The District Court found no authority for the proposition\nthat the First Amendment required Greece to invite clergy from\ncongregations beyond its borders in order to achieve a minimum\nlevel of religious diversity. The District Court also\nrejected the theory that legislative prayer must be nonsectarian.\nThe court began its inquiry with the opinion in Marsh v. Chambers,\n463 U. S. 783 , which permitted prayer in state legislatures\nby a chaplain paid from the public purse, so long as the prayer\nopportunity was not “exploited to proselytize or advance any\none, or to disparage any other, faith or belief,” id., at\n794–795. With respect to the prayer in Greece, the District\nCourt concluded that references to Jesus, and the occasional\nrequest that the audience stand for the prayer, did not amount to\nimpermissible proselytizing. It located in Marsh no additional\nrequirement that the prayers be purged of sectarian content. In\nthis regard the court quoted recent invocations offered in the\nU. S. House of Representatives “in the name of our Lord\nJesus Christ,” e.g., 156 Cong Rec. H5205 (June 30, 2010), and\nsituated prayer in this context as part a long tradition. Finally,\nthe trial court noted this Court’s statement in County of\nAllegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh\nChapter, 492 U. S. 573, 603 (1989) , that the prayers in Marsh\ndid not offend the Establishment Clause “because the\nparticular chaplain had ‘removed all references to\nChrist.’ ” But the District Court did not read\nthat statement to mandate that legislative prayer be nonsectarian,\nat least in circumstances where the town permitted clergy from a\nvariety of faiths to give invocations. By welcoming many\nviewpoints, the District Court concluded, the town would be\nunlikely to give the impression that it was affiliating itself with\nany one religion. The Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit reversed. 681 F. 3d 20, 34 (2012). It\nheld that some aspects of the prayer program, viewed in their\ntotality by a reasonable observer, conveyed the message that Greece\nwas endorsing Christianity. The town’s failure to promote the\nprayer opportunity to the public, or to invite ministers from\ncongregations outside the town limits, all but “ensured a\nChristian viewpoint.” Id., at 30–31. Although the court\nfound no inherent problem in the sectarian content of the prayers,\nit concluded that the “steady drumbeat” of Christian\nprayer, unbroken by invocations from other faith traditions, tended\nto affiliate the town with Christianity. Id., at 32. Finally, the\ncourt found it relevant that guest clergy sometimes spoke on behalf\nof all present at the meeting, as by saying “let us\npray,” or by asking audience members to stand and bow their\nheads: “The invitation . . . to participate in the\nprayer . . . placed audience members who are nonreligious\nor adherents of non-Christian religion in the awkward position of\neither participating in prayers invoking beliefs they did not share\nor appearing to show disrespect for the invocation.” Ibid.\nThat board members bowed their heads or made the sign of the cross\nfurther conveyed the message that the town endorsed Christianity.\nThe Court of Appeals emphasized that it was the “interaction\nof the facts present in this case,” rather than any single\nelement, that rendered the prayer unconstitutional. Id., at 33. Having granted\ncertiorari to decide whether the town’s prayer practice\nviolates the Establishment Clause, 569 U. S. ___ (2013), the\nCourt now reverses the judgment of the Court of Appeals. II In Marsh v. Chambers,\n463 U. S. 783 , the Court found no First Amendment violation\nin the Nebraska Legislature’s practice of opening its\nsessions with a prayer delivered by a chaplain paid from state\nfunds. The decision concluded that legislative prayer, while\nreligious in nature, has long been understood as compatible with\nthe Establishment Clause. As practiced by Congress since the\nframing of the Constitution, legislative prayer lends grav-ity to\npublic business, reminds lawmakers to transcend petty differences\nin pursuit of a higher purpose, and expresses a common aspiration\nto a just and peaceful soci-ety. See Lynch v. Donnelly, 465\nU. S. 668, 693 (1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring); cf. A.\nAdams & C. Emmerich, A Nation Dedicated to Religious Liberty 83\n(1990). The Court has considered this symbolic expression to be a\n“tolerable acknowledgement of beliefs widely held,”\nMarsh, 463 U. S., at 792, rather than a first, treacherous\nstep towards establishment of a state church. Marsh is sometimes\ndescribed as “carving out an exception” to the\nCourt’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence, because it\nsustained legislative prayer without subjecting the practice to\n“any of the formal ‘tests’ that have\ntraditionally structured” this inquiry. Id., at 796, 813\n(Brennan, J., dissenting). The Court in Marsh found those tests\nunnecessary because history supported the conclusion that\nlegislative invocations are compatible with the Establishment\nClause. The First Congress made it an early item of business to\nappoint and pay official chaplains, and both the House and Senate\nhave maintained the office virtually uninterrupted since that time.\nSee id., at 787–789, and n. 10; N. Feldman, Divided by\nGod 109 (2005). But see Marsh, supra, at 791–792, and\nn. 12 (noting dissenting views among the Framers); Madison,\n“Detached Memoranda”, 3 Wm. & Mary Quarterly 534,\n558–559 (1946) (hereinafter Madison’s Detached\nMemoranda). When Marsh was decided, in 1983, legislative prayer had\npersisted in the Nebraska Legislature for more than a cen-tury, and\nthe majority of the other States also had the same, consistent\npractice. 463 U. S., at 788–790, and n. 11.\nAlthough no information has been cited by the parties to indicate\nhow many local legislative bodies open their meetings with prayer,\nthis practice too has historical precedent. See Reports of\nProceedings of the City Council of Boston for the Year Commencing\nJan. 1, 1909, and Ending Feb. 5, 1910, pp. 1–2 (1910) (Rev.\nArthur Little) (“And now we desire to invoke Thy presence,\nThy blessing, and Thy guidance upon those who are gathered here\nthis morning . . .”). “In light of the\nunambiguous and unbroken history of more than 200 years, there can\nbe no doubt that the practice of opening legislative sessions with\na prayer has become part of the fabric of our society.”\nMarsh, supra, at 792. Yet Marsh must not be\nunderstood as permitting a practice that would amount to a\nconstitutional violation if not for its historical foundation. The\ncase teaches instead that the Establishment Clause must be\ninterpreted “by reference to historical practices and\nunderstandings.” County of Allegheny, 492 U. S., at 670\n(Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in\npart). That the First Congress provided for the appointment of\nchaplains only days after approving language for the First\nAmendment demonstrates that the Framers considered legislative\nprayer a benign acknowledgment of religion’s role in society.\nD. Currie, The Constitution in Congress: The Federalist Period\n1789–1801, pp. 12–13 (1997). In the 1850’s, the\njudiciary committees in both the House and Senate reevaluated the\npractice of official chaplaincies after receiving petitions to\nabolish the office. The committees concluded that the office posed\nno threat of an establishment because lawmakers were not compelled\nto attend the daily prayer, S. Rep. No. 376, 32d Cong., 2d\nSess., 2 (1853); no faith was excluded by law, nor any favored,\nid., at 3; and the cost of the chaplain’s salary imposed a\nvanishingly small burden on taxpayers, H. Rep. No. 124, 33d\nCong., 1st Sess., 6 (1854). Marsh stands for the proposition that\nit is not necessary to define the precise boundary of the\nEstablishment Clause where history shows that the specific practice\nis permitted. Any test the Court adopts must acknowledge a practice\nthat was accepted by the Framers and has withstood the critical\nscrutiny of time and political change. County of Allegheny, supra,\nat 670 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); see also School Dist. of Abington\nTownship v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 294 (1963) (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring) (“[T]he line we must draw between the permissible\nand the impermissible is one which accords with history and\nfaithfully reflects the understanding of the Founding\nFathers”). A test that would sweep away what has so long been\nsettled would create new controversy and begin anew the very\ndivisions along religious lines that the Establishment Clause seeks\nto prevent. See Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U. S. 677 –704\n(2005) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). The Court’s\ninquiry, then, must be to determine whether the prayer practice in\nthe town of Greece fits within the tradition long followed in\nCongress and the state legislatures. Respondents assert that the\ntown’s prayer exercise falls outside that tradition and\ntransgresses the Establishment Clause for two independent but\nmutually reinforcing reasons. First, they argue that Marsh did not\napprove prayers containing sectarian language or themes, such as\nthe prayers offered in Greece that referred to the “death,\nresurrection, and ascension of the Savior Jesus Christ,” App.\n129a, and the “saving sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the\ncross,” id., at 88a. Second, they argue that the setting and\nconduct of the town board meetings create social pressures that\nforce nonadherents to remain in the room or even feign\nparticipation in order to avoid offending the representatives who\nsponsor the prayer and will vote on matters citizens bring before\nthe board. The sectarian content of the prayers compounds the\nsubtle coercive pressures, they argue, because the nonbeliever who\nmight tolerate ecumenical prayer is forced to do the same for\nprayer that might be inimical to his or her beliefs. A Respondents maintain\nthat prayer must be nonsectarian, or not identifiable with any one\nreligion; and they faultthe town for permitting guest chaplains to\ndeliver prayers that “use overtly Christian terms” or\n“invoke specifics of Christian theology.” Brief for\nRespondents 20. A prayer is fitting for the public sphere, in their\nview, only if it contains the ‘ “most general,\nnonsectarian reference to God,’ ” id., at 33\n(quoting M. Meyerson, Endowed by Our Creator: The Birth of\nReligious Freedom in America 11–12 (2012)), and eschews\nmention of doctrines associated with any one faith, Brief for\nRespondents 32–33. They argue that prayer which contemplates\n“the workings of the Holy Spirit, the events of Pentecost,\nand the belief that God ‘has raisedup the Lord Jesus’\nand ‘will raise us, in our turn, and put us by His\nside’ ” would be impermissible, as would any\nprayer that reflects dogma particular to a single faith tradition.\nId., at 34 (quoting App. 89a and citing id., at 56a, 123a,\n134a). An insistence on\nnonsectarian or ecumenical prayer as a single, fixed standard is\nnot consistent with the tradition of legislative prayer outlined in\nthe Court’s cases. The Court found the prayers in Marsh\nconsistent with the First Amendment not because they espoused only\na ge-neric theism but because our history and tradition have shown\nthat prayer in this limited context could “coexis[t] with the\nprinciples of disestablishment and religious freedom.” 463\nU. S., at 786. The Congress that drafted the First Amendment\nwould have been accustomed to invocations containing explicitly\nreligious themes of the sort respondents find objectionable. One of\nthe Senate’s first chaplains, the Rev. William White, gave\nprayers in a series that included the Lord’s Prayer, the\nCollect forAsh Wednesday, prayers for peace and grace, a general\nthanksgiving, St. Chrysostom’s Prayer, and a prayer seeking\n“the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, &c.” Letter\nfrom W. White to H. Jones (Dec. 29, 1830), in B. Wilson, Memoir of\nthe Life of the Right Reverend William White, D. D., Bishop of the\nProtestant Episcopal Church in the State of Pennsylvania 322\n(1839); see also New Hampshire Patriot & State Gazette, Dec.\n15, 1823, p. 1 (describing a Senate prayer addressing the\n“Throne of Grace”); Cong. Globe, 37th Cong., 1st Sess.,\n2 (1861) (reciting the Lord’s Prayer). The decidedly\nChristian nature of these prayers must not be dismissed as the\nrelic of a time when our Nation was less pluralistic than it is\ntoday. Congress continues to permit its appointed and visiting\nchaplains to express themselves in a religious idiom. It\nacknowledges our growing diversity not by proscribing sectarian\ncontent but by welcoming ministers of many creeds. See, e.g., 160\nCong. Rec. S1329 (Mar. 6, 2014) (Dalai Lama) (“I am a\nBuddhist monk—a simple Buddhist monk—so we pray to\nBuddha and all other Gods”); 159 Cong. Rec. H7006 (Nov. 13,\n2013) (Rabbi Joshua Gruenberg) (“Our God and God of our\nancestors, Everlasting Spirit of the Universe\n. . .”); 159 Cong. Rec. H3024 (June 4, 2013)\n(Satguru Bodhinatha Veylanswami) (“Hindu scripture declares,\nwithout equivocation, that the highest of high ideals is to never\nknow-ingly harm anyone”); 158 Cong. Rec. H5633 (Aug. 2, 2012)\n(Imam Nayyar Imam) (“The final prophet of God, Muhammad,\npeace be upon him, stated: ‘The leaders of a people are a\nrepresentation of their deeds’ ”). The contention that\nlegislative prayer must be generic or nonsectarian derives from\ndictum in County of Allegheny, 492 U. S. 573 , that was\ndisputed when written and has been repudiated by later cases. There\nthe Court held that a crèche placed on the steps of a county\ncourthouse to celebrate the Christmas season violated the\nEstablishment Clause because it had “the effect of endorsing\na patently Christian message.” Id., at 601. Four dissenting\nJustices disputed that endorsement could be the proper test, as it\nlikely would condemn a host of traditional practices that recognize\nthe role religion plays in our society, among them legislative\nprayer and the “forthrightly religious” Thanksgiving\nproclamations issued by nearly every President since Washington.\nId., at 670–671. The Court sought to counter this criticism\nby recasting Marsh to permit only prayer that contained no overtly\nChristian references: “However history may affect the\nconstitutionality of nonsectarian references to religion by the\ngovernment, history cannot legitimate practices that demonstrate\nthe government’s allegiance to a particular sect or creed\n. . . . The legislative prayers involved in Marsh\ndid not violate this principle because the particular chaplain had\n‘removed all references to Christ.’ ” Id.,\nat 603 (quoting Marsh, supra, at 793, n. 14; footnote\nomitted). This proposition is\nirreconcilable with the facts of Marsh and with its holding and\nreasoning. Marsh nowhere suggested that the constitutionality of\nlegislative prayer turns on the neutrality of its content. The\nopinion noted that Nebraska’s chaplain, the Rev. Robert E.\nPalmer, modu-lated the “explicitly Christian” nature of\nhis prayer and “removed all references to Christ” after\na Jewish law-maker complained. 463 U. S., at 793, n. 14.\nWith this foot-note, the Court did no more than observe the\npractical demands placed on a minister who holds a permanent,\nappointed position in a legislature and chooses to write his or her\nprayers to appeal to more members, or at least to give less offense\nto those who object. See Mallory, “An Officer of the House\nWhich Chooses Him, and Nothing More”: How Should Marsh v.\nChambers Apply to Rotating Chaplains?, 73 U. Chi. L. Rev.\n1421, 1445 (2006). Marsh did not suggest that Nebraska’s\nprayer practice would have failed had the chaplain not acceded to\nthe legislator’s request. Nor did the Court imply the rule\nthat prayer violates the Establishment Clause any time it is given\nin the name of a figure deified by only one faith or creed. See Van\nOrden, 545 U. S., at 688, n. 8 (recognizing that the\nprayers in Marsh were “often explicitly Christian” and\nrejecting the view that this gave rise to an establishment\nviolation). To the contrary, the Court instructed that the\n“content of the prayer is not of concern to judges,”\nprovided “there is no indication that the prayer opportunity\nhas been exploited to proselytize or advance any one, or to\ndisparage any other, faith or belief.” 463 U. S., at\n794–795. To hold that\ninvocations must be nonsectarian would force the legislatures that\nsponsor prayers and the courts that are asked to decide these cases\nto act as supervisors and censors of religious speech, a rule that\nwould involve government in religious matters to a far greater\ndegree than is the case under the town’s current practice of\nneither editing or approving prayers in advance nor criticizing\ntheir content after the fact. Cf. Hosanna-Tabor E",
    "textpassage": "\"The town’s prayer practice does not violate the Establishment Clause. The prayers delivered in Greece do not fall outside this tradition. They may have invoked, e.g., the name of Jesus, but they also invoked universal themes, e.g., by calling for a 'spirit of cooperation.'\""

ENVIRONMENTAL\nPROTECTION AGENCY et al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the district of columbia circuit[ 1 ] No. 14–46. Argued March 25, 2015—Decided June\n29, 2015 The Clean Air Act directs the Environmental\nProtection Agency to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants\nfrom certain stationary sources (such as refineries and factories).\n42 U. S. C. §7412. The Agency may regulate power plants\nunder this program only if it concludes that “regulation is\nappropriate and necessary” after studying hazards to public health\nposed by power-plant emissions. §7412(n)(1)(A). Here, EPA found\npower-plant regulation “appropriate” because the plants’ emissions\npose risks to public health and the environment and because\ncontrols capable of reducing these emissions were available. It\nfound regulation “necessary” because the imposition of other Clean\nAir Act requirements did not eliminate those risks. The Agency\nrefused to consider cost when making its decision. It estimated,\nhowever, that the cost of its regulations to power plants would be\n$9.6 billion a year, but the quantifiable benefits from the\nresulting reduction in hazardous-air-pollutant emissions would be\n$4 to $6 million a year. Petitioners (including 23 States) sought\nreview of EPA’s rule in the D. C. Circuit, which upheld the\nAgency’s refusal to consider costs in its decision to regulate. Held : EPA interpreted\n§7412(n)(1)(A) unreasonably when it deemed cost irrelevant to the\ndecision to regulate power plants. Pp. 5–15. (a) Agency action is unlawful if it does\nnot rest “ ‘on a consideration of the relevant\nfactors.’ ” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States,\nInc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. , 463\nU. S. 29 . Even under the deferential standard of Chevron\nU. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense\nCouncil, Inc. , 467 U. S. 837 , which directs courts to\naccept an agency’s reasonable resolution of an ambiguity in a\nstatute that the agency administers, id., at 842–843, EPA\nstrayed well beyond the bounds of reasonable interpretation in\nconcluding that cost is not a factor relevant to the\nappropriateness of regulating power plants. Pp. 5–6. (b) “Appropriate and necessary” is a\ncapacious phrase. Read naturally against the backdrop of\nestablished administrative law, this phrase plainly encompasses\ncost. It is not rational, never mind “appropriate,” to impose\nbillions of dollars in economic costs in return for a few dollars\nin health or environmental benefits. Statutory context supports\nthis reading. Section 7412(n)(1) required the EPA to conduct three\nstudies, including one that reflects concern about cost, see\n§7412(n)(1)(B); and the Agency agrees that the term “appropriate\nand necessary” must be interpreted in light of all three studies.\nPp. 6–9. (c) EPA’s counterarguments are\nunpersuasive. That other Clean Air Act provisions expressly mention\ncost only shows that §7412(n)(1)(A)’s broad reference to\nappropriateness encompasses multiple relevant factors, one\nof which is cost. Similarly, the modest principle of Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc. , 531 U. S. 457 —when\nthe Clean Air Act expressly directs EPA to regulate on the basis of\na discrete factor that does not include cost, the Act should not be\nread as implicitly allowing consideration of cost anyway—has no\nbearing on this case. Furthermore, the possibility of considering\ncost at a later stage, when deciding how much to regulate\npower plants, does not establish its irrelevance at this stage. And although the Clean Air Act makes cost irrelevant to the\ninitial decision to regulate sources other than power plants, the\nwhole point of having a separate provision for power plants was to\ntreat power plants differently . Pp. 9–12. (d)  EPA must consider cost—including\ncost of compliance—before deciding whether regulation is\nappropriate and necessary. It will be up to the Agency to decide\n(as always, within the limits of reasonable interpretation) how to\naccount for cost. Pp. 12–15. 748 F. 3d 1222, reversed and\nremanded. Scalia, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Thomas, and\nAlito, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ Nos. 14–46, 14–47, and 14–49 _________________ MICHIGAN, et al., PETITIONERS 14–46 v. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY,\net al. UTILITY AIR REGULATORY GROUP,\nPETITIONER 14–47 v. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY,\net al. NATIONAL MINING ASSOCIATION,\nPETITIONER 14–49 v. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY,\net al. on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the district of columbia circuit [June 29, 2015] Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. The Clean Air Act directs the Environmental\nProtection Agency to regulate emissions of hazardous air pollutants\nfrom power plants if the Agency finds regulation “appropriate and\nnecessary.” We must decide whether it was reasonable for EPA to\nrefuse to consider cost when making this finding. I The Clean Air Act establishes a series of\nregulatory programs to control air pollution from stationary\nsources (such as refineries and factories) and moving sources (such\nas cars and airplanes). 69Stat. 322, as amended, 42\nU. S. C. §§7401–7671q. One of these is the National\nEmissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Program—the\nhazardous-air-pollutants program, for short. Established in its\ncurrent form by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 104Stat.\n2531, this program targets for regulation stationary-source\nemissions of more than 180 specified “hazardous air pollutants.”\n§7412(b). For stationary sources in general, the\napplicability of the program depends in part on how much pollution\nthe source emits. A source that emits more than 10 tons of a single\npollutant or more than 25 tons of a combination of pollutants per\nyear is called a major source. §7412(a)(1). EPA is required to\nregulate all major sources under the program. §7412(c)(1)–(2). A\nsource whose emissions do not cross the just-mentioned thresholds\nis called an area source. §7412(a)(2). The Agency is required to\nregulate an area source under the program if it “presents a threat\nof adverse effects to human health or the environment\n. . . warranting regulation.” §7412(c)(3). At the same time, Congress established a unique\nprocedure to determine the applicability of the program to\nfossil-fuel-fired power plants. The Act refers to these plants as\nelectric utility steam generating units, but we will simply call\nthem power plants. Quite apart from the hazardous-air-pollutants\nprogram, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 subjected power\nplants to various regulatory requirements. The parties agree that\nthese requirements were expected to have the collateral effect of\nreducing power plants’ emissions of hazardous air pollutants,\nalthough the extent of the reduction was unclear. Congress directed\nthe Agency to “perform a study of the hazards to public health\nreasonably anticipated to occur as a result of emissions by [power\nplants] of [hazardous air pollutants] after imposition of the\nrequirements of this chapter.” §7412(n)(1)(A). If the Agency “finds\n. . . regulation is appropriate and necessary after\nconsidering the results of the study,” it “shall regulate [power\nplants] under [§7412].” Ibid. EPA has interpreted the Act to\nmean that power plants become subject to regulation on the same\nterms as ordinary major and area sources, see 77 Fed. Reg. 9330\n(2012), and we assume without deciding that it was correct to do\nso. And what are those terms? EPA must first divide\nsources covered by the program into categories and subcategories in\naccordance with statutory criteria. §7412(c)(1). For each category\nor subcategory, the Agency must promulgate certain minimum emission\nregulations, known as floor standards. §7412(d)(1), (3). The\nstatute generally calibrates the floor standards to reflect the\nemissions limitations already achieved by the best-performing 12%\nof sources within the category or subcategory. §7412(d)(3). In some\ncircumstances, the Agency may also impose more stringent emission\nregulations, known as beyond-the-floor standards. The statute\nexpressly requires the Agency to consider cost (alongside other\nspecified factors) when imposing beyond-the-floor standards.\n§7412(d)(2). EPA completed the study required by\n§7412(n)(1)(A) in 1998, 65 Fed. Reg. 79826 (2000), and concluded\nthat regulation of coal- and oil-fired power plants was\n“appropriate and necessary” in 2000, id., at 79830. In 2012,\nit reaffirmed the appropriate-and-necessary finding, divided power\nplants into subcategories, and promulgated floor standards. The\nAgency found regulation “appropriate” because (1) power plants’\nemissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants posed risks\nto human health and the environment and (2) controls were available\nto reduce these emissions. 77 Fed. Reg. 9363. It found regulation\n“necessary” because the imposition of the Act’s other requirements\ndid not eliminate these risks. Ibid. EPA concluded that\n“costs should not be considered” when deciding whether power plants\nshould be regulated under §7412. Id., at 9326. In accordance with Executive Order, the Agency\nissued a “Regulatory Impact Analysis” alongside its regulation.\nThis analysis estimated that the regulation would force power\nplants to bear costs of $9.6 billion per year. Id., at 9306.\nThe Agency could not fully quantify the benefits of reducing power\nplants’ emissions of hazardous air pollutants; to the extent it\ncould, it estimated that these benefits were worth $4 to $6 million\nper year. Ibid. The costs to power plants were thus between\n1,600 and 2,400 times as great as the quantifiable benefits from\nreduced emissions of hazardous air pollutants. The Agency continued\nthat its regulations would have ancillary benefits—including\ncutting power plants’ emissions of particulate matter and sulfur\ndioxide, substances that are not covered by the\nhazardous-air-pollutants program. Although the Agency’s\nappropriate-and-necessary finding did not rest on these ancillary\neffects, id., at 9320, the regulatory impact analysis took\nthem into account, increasing the Agency’s estimate of the\nquantifiable benefits of its regulation to $37 to $90 billion per\nyear, id., at 9306 . EPA concedes that the regulatory\nimpact analysis “played no role” in its appropriate-and-necessary\nfinding. Brief for Federal Respondents 14. Petitioners (who include 23 States) sought\nreview of EPA’s rule in the Court of Appeals for the D. C.\nCircuit. As relevant here, they challenged the Agency’s refusal to\nconsider cost when deciding whether to regulate power plants. The\nCourt of Appeals upheld the Agency’s decision not to consider cost,\nwith Judge Kavanaugh concurring in part and dissenting in part. White Stallion Energy Center, LLC v. EPA , 748\nF. 3d 1222 (2014) ( per curiam ). We granted certiorari.\n574 U. S. ___ (2014). II Federal administrative agencies are required\nto engage in “reasoned decisionmaking.” Allentown Mack Sales\n& Service, Inc. v. NLRB , 522 U. S. 359, 374\n(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). “Not only must an\nagency’s decreed result be within the scope of its lawful\nauthority, but the process by which it reaches that result must be\nlogical and rational.” Ibid. It follows that agency action\nis lawful only if it rests “on a consideration of the relevant\nfactors.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co. , 463 U. S. 29,\n43 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). EPA’s decision to regulate power plants under\n§7412 allowed the Agency to reduce power plants’ emissions of\nhazardous air pollutants and thus to improve public health and the\nenvironment. But the decision also ultimately cost power plants,\naccording to the Agency’s own estimate, nearly $10 billion a year.\nEPA refused to consider whether the costs of its decision\noutweighed the benefits. The Agency gave cost no thought at\nall , be-cause it considered cost irrelevant to its initial\ndecision to regulate. EPA’s disregard of cost rested on its\ninterpretation of §7412(n)(1)(A), which, to repeat, directs the\nAgency to regulate power plants if it “finds such regulation is\nappropriate and necessary.” The Agency accepts that it could have interpreted this provision to mean that cost is relevant to\nthe decision to add power plants to the program. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n44. But it chose to read the statute to mean that cost makes no\ndifference to the initial decision to regulate. See 76 Fed. Reg.\n24988 (2011) (“We further interpret the term ‘appropriate’ to not\nallow for the consideration of costs”); 77 Fed. Reg. 9327 (“Cost\ndoes not have to be read into the definition of\n‘appropriate’ ”). We review this interpretation under the standard\nset out in Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc. , 467 U. S. 837 (1984) . Chevron directs courts to accept an agency’s reasonable\nresolution of an ambigu-ity in a statute that the agency\nadministers. Id., at 842–843. Even under this deferential\nstandard, however, “agencies must operate within the bounds of\nreasonable interpretation. ” Utility Air Regulatory\nGroup v. EPA , 573 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op.,\nat 16) (internal quotation marks omitted). EPA strayed far beyond\nthose bounds when it read §7412(n)(1) to mean that it could ignore\ncost when deciding whether to regulate power plants. A The Clean Air Act treats power plants\ndifferently from other sources for purposes of the\nhazardous-air-pollutants program. Elsewhere in §7412, Congress\nestablished cabined criteria for EPA to apply when deciding whether\nto include sources in the program. It required the Agency to\nregulate sources whose emissions exceed specified numerical\nthresholds (major sources). It also required the Agency to regulate\nsources whose emissions fall short of these thresholds (area\nsources) if they “presen[t] a threat of adverse effects to human\nhealth or the environment . . . warranting regulation.”\n§7412(c)(3). In stark contrast, Congress instructed EPA to add\npower plants to the program if (but only if) the Agency finds\nregulation “appropriate and necessary.” §7412(n)(1)(A). One does\nnot need to open up a dictionary in order to realize the\ncapaciousness of this phrase. In particular, “appropriate” is “the\nclassic broad and all-encompassing term that naturally and\ntraditionally includes consideration of all the relevant factors.”\n748 F. 3d, at 1266 (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.). Although this\nterm leaves agencies with flexibility, an agency may not “entirely\nfai[l] to consider an important aspect of the problem” when\ndeciding whether regulation is appropriate. State Farm , supra , at 43. Read naturally in the present context, the\nphrase “appropriate and necessary” requires at least some attention\nto cost. One would not say that it is even rational, never mind\n“appropriate,” to impose billions of dollars in economic costs in\nreturn for a few dollars in health or environmental benefits. In\naddition, “cost” includes more than the expense of complying with\nregulations; any disadvantage could be termed a cost. EPA’s\ninterpretation precludes the Agency from considering any type of cost—including, for instance, harms that regulation might\ndo to human health or the environment. The Government concedes that\nif the Agency were to find that emissions from power plants do\ndamage to human health, but that the technologies needed to\neliminate these emissions do even more damage to human health, it\nwould still deem regulation appropriate. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 70. No regulation is “appropriate” if it does significantly\nmore harm than good. There are undoubtedly settings in which the\nphrase “appropriate and necessary” does not encompass cost. But\nthis is not one of them. Section 7412(n)(1)(A) directs EPA to\ndetermine whether “ regulation is appropriate and necessary.”\n(Emphasis added.) Agencies have long treated cost as a centrally\nrelevant factor when deciding whether to regulate. Consideration of\ncost reflects the understanding that reasonable regulation\nordinarily requires paying attention to the advantages and the disadvantages of agency decisions. It also reflects the reality\nthat “too much wasteful expenditure devoted to one problem may well\nmean considerably fewer resources available to deal effectively\nwith other (perhaps more serious) problems.” Entergy Corp. v. Riverkeeper, Inc. , 556 U. S. 208, 233 (2009)\n(Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Against\nthe backdrop of this established administrative practice, it is\nunreasonable to read an instruction to an administrative agency to\ndetermine whether “regulation is appropriate and necessary” as an\ninvitation to ignore cost. Statutory context reinforces the relevance of\ncost. The procedures governing power plants that we consider today\nappear in §7412(n)(1), which bears the caption “Electric utility\nsteam generating units.” In subparagraph (A), the part of the law\nthat has occupied our attention so far, Congress required EPA to\nstudy the hazards to public health posed by power plants and to\ndetermine whether regulation is appropriate and necessary. But in\nsubparagraphs (B) and (C), Congress called for two additional\nstudies. One of them, a study into mercury emissions from power\nplants and other sources, must consider “the health and\nenvironmental effects of such emissions, technologies which are\navailable to control such emissions, and the costs of such\ntechnologies .” §7412(n)(1)(B) (emphasis added). This directive\nto EPA to study cost is a further indication of the relevance of\ncost to the decision to regulate. In an effort to minimize this express reference\nto cost, EPA now argues that §7412(n)(1)(A) requires it to consider\nonly the study mandated by that provision, not the separate mercury\nstudy, before deciding whether to regulate power plants. But when\nadopting the regulations before us, the Agency insisted that the\nprovisions concerning all three studies “provide a framework for\n[EPA’s] determination of whether to regulate [power plants].” 76\nFed. Reg. 24987. It therefore decided “to interpret the scope of\nthe appropriate and necessary finding in the context of all three studies .” 77 Fed. Reg. 9325 (emphasis added). For\nexample: EPA considered environmental effects\nrelevant to the appropriate-and-necessary finding. It deemed the\nmercury study’s reference to this factor “direct evidence that\nCongress was concerned with environmental effects.” 76 Fed. Reg.\n24987. EPA considered availability of controls\nrelevant to the appropriate-and-necessary finding. It thought that\ndoing so was “consistent with” the mercury study’s reference to\navailability of controls. Id., at 24989. EPA concluded that regulation of power\nplants would be appropriate and necessary even if a single\npollutant emitted by them posed a hazard to health or the\nenvironment. It believed that “Congress’ focus” on a single\npollutant in the mercury study “support[ed]” this interpretation. Ibid. EPA has not explained why §7412(n)(1)(B)’s\nreference to “environmental effects . . . and\n. . . costs” provides “direct evidence that Congress was\nconcerned with environmental effects,” but not “direct evidence”\nthat it was concerned with cost. Chevron allows agencies to\nchoose among competing reasonable interpretations of a statute; it\ndoes not license interpretive gerrymanders under which an agency\nkeeps parts of statutory context it likes while throwing away parts\nit does not. B EPA identifies a handful of reasons to\ninterpret §7412(n)(1)(A) to mean that cost is irrelevant to the\ninitial decision to regulate. We find those reasons\nunpersuasive. EPA points out that other parts of the Clean Air\nAct expressly mention cost, while §7412(n)(1)(A) does not. But this\nobservation shows only that §7412(n)(1)(A)’s broad reference to\nappropriateness encompasses multiple relevant factors (which\ninclude but are not limited to cost); other provisions’ specific\nreferences to cost encompass just cost. It is unreasonable to infer\nthat, by expressly making cost relevant to other decisions, the Act\nimplicitly makes cost irrelevant to the appropriateness of\nregulating power plants. (By way of analogy, the Fourth Amendment’s\nReasonableness Clause requires searches to be “[r]easonable,” while\nits Warrant Clause requires warrants to be supported by “probable\ncause.” Nobody would argue that, by expressly making level of\nsuspicion relevant to the validity of a warrant, the Fourth\nAmendment implicitly makes level of suspicion categorically irrelevant to the reasonableness of a search. To the\ncontrary, all would agree that the expansive word “reasonable”\nencompasses degree of suspicion alongside other relevant\ncircumstances.) Other parts of the Clean Air Act also expressly\nmen-tion environmental effects, while §7412(n)(1)(A) does not. Yet\nthat did not stop EPA from deeming environmental effects relevant\nto the appropriateness of regulating power plants. Along similar lines, EPA seeks support in this\nCourt’s decision in Whitman v. American Trucking Assns.,\nInc. , 531 U. S. 457 (2001) . There, the Court addressed a\nprovision of the Clean Air Act requiring EPA to set ambient air\nquality standards at levels “requisite to protect the public\nhealth” with an “adequate margin of safety.” 42 U. S. C.\n§7409(b). Read naturally, that discrete criterion does not\nencompass cost; it encompasses health and safety. The Court refused\nto read that provision as carrying with it an implicit\nauthorization to consider cost, in part because authority to\nconsider cost had “elsewhere, and so often, been expressly\ngranted.” 531 U. S., at 467. American Trucking thus\nestablishes the modest principle that where the Clean Air Act\nexpressly directs EPA to regulate on the basis of a factor that on\nits face does not include cost, the Act normally should not be read\nas implicitly allowing the Agency to consider cost anyway. That\nprinciple has no application here. “Appropriate and necessary” is a\nfar more comprehensive criterion than “requisite to protect the\npublic health”; read fairly and in context, as we have explained,\nthe term plainly subsumes consideration of cost. Turning to the mechanics of the\nhazardous-air-pollutants program, EPA argues that it need not\nconsider cost when first deciding whether to regulate power\nplants because it can consider cost later when deciding how\nmuch to regulate them. The question before us, however, is the\nmeaning of the “appropriate and necessary” standard that governs\nthe initial decision to regulate. And as we have discussed, context\nestablishes that this expansive standard encompasses cost. Cost may\nbecome relevant again at a later stage of the regulatory process,\nbut that possibility does not establish its irrelevance at this stage. In addition, once the Agency decides to regulate\npower plants, it must promulgate certain minimum or floor standards\nno matter the cost (here, nearly $10 billion a year); theAgency may\nconsider cost only when imposing regulations beyond these\nminimum standards. By EPA’s logic, someone could decide whether it\nis “appropriate” to buy a Ferrari without thinking about cost,\nbecause he plans to think about cost later when deciding whether to\nupgrade the sound system. EPA argues that the Clean Air Act makes cost\nirrelevant to the initial decision to regulate sources other than\npower plants. The Agency claims that it is reasonable to interpret\n§7412(n)(1)(A) in a way that “harmonizes” the program’s treatment\nof power plants with its treatment of other sources. This line of\nreasoning overlooks the whole point of having a separate provision\nabout power plants: treating power plants differently from\nother stationary sources. Congress crafted narrow standards for EPA\nto apply when deciding whether to regulate other sources; in\ngeneral, these standards concern the volume of pollution emitted by\nthe source, §7412(c)(1), and the threat posed by the source “to\nhuman health or the environment,” §7412(c)(3). But Congress wrote\nthe provision before us more expansively, directing the Agency to\nregulate power plants if “appropriate and necessary.” “That\ncongressional election settles this case. [The Agency’s] preference\nfor symmetry cannot trump an asymmetrical statute.” CSX Transp.,\nInc. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue , 562 U. S. 277,\n296 (2011) . EPA persists that Congress treated power plants\ndifferently from other sources because of uncertainty about whether\nregulation of power plants would still be needed after the\napplication of the rest of the Act’s requirements. That is\nundoubtedly one of the reasons Congress treated power plants\ndifferently; hence §7412(n)(1)(A)’s requirement to study hazards\nposed by power plants’ emissions “after imposition of the\nrequirements of [the rest of the Act].” But if uncertainty about\nthe need for regulation were the only reason to treat power\nplants differently, Congress would have required the Agency to\ndecide only whether regulation remains “necessary,” not whether\nregulation is “appropriate and necessary.” In any event, EPA\nstated when it adopted the rule that “Congress did not limit [the]\nappropriate and necessary inquiry to [the study mentioned in\n§7412(n)(1)(A)].” 77 Fed. Reg. 9325. The Agency instead decided\nthat the appropriate-and-necessary finding should be understood in\nlight of all three studies required by §7412(n)(1), and as we have\ndiscussed, one of those three studies reflects concern about\ncost. C The dissent does not embrace EPA’s far-reaching\nclaim that Congress made costs altogether irrelevant to the\ndecision to regulate power plants. Instead, it maintains that EPA\nneed not “explicitly analyze costs” before deeming regulation\nappropriate, because other features of the regulatory program will\non their own ensure the cost-effectiveness of regulation. Post, at 2 (opinion of Kagan, J.). This line of reasoning\ncontradicts the foundational principle of administrative law that a\ncourt may uphold agency action only on the grounds that the agency\ninvoked when it took the action. SEC v. Chenery\nCorp. , 318 U. S. 80, 87 (1943). When it deemed regulation\nof power plants appropriate, EPA said that cost was irrelevant to that determination—not that cost-benefit\nanalysis would be deferred until later. Much less did it say\n(what the dissent now concludes) that the consideration of cost at\nsubsequent stages will ensure that the costs are not\ndisproportionate to the benefits. What it said is that cost is\nirrelevant to the decision to regulate. That is enough to decide these cases. But for\nwhat it is worth, the dissent vastly overstates the influence of\ncost at later stages of the regulatory process. For example, the\ndissent claims that the floor standards—which the Act calibrates to\nreflect emissions limitations already achieved by the\nbest-performing sources in the industry—reflect cost\nconsiderations, because the best-performing power plants “must have\nconsidered costs in arriving at their emissions outputs.” Post, at 10. EPA did not rely on this argument, and it is\nnot obvious that it is correct. Because power plants are regulated\nunder other federal and state laws, the best-performing power\nplants’ emissions limitations might reflect cost-blind regulation\nrather than cost-conscious decisions. Similarly, the dissent\nsuggests that EPA may consider cost when dividing sources into\ncategories and subcategories. Post, at 11–12. Yet according\nto EPA, “it is not appropriate to premise subcategorization\non costs.” 77 Fed. Reg. 9395 (emphasis added). That statement\npresumably explains the dissent’s carefully worded observation that\nEPA considered “technological, geographic, and other factors” when\ndrawing categories, post, at 13, n. 4, which factors\nwere in turn “related to costs” in some way, post, at 11.\nAttenuated connections such as these hardly support the assertion\nthat EPA’s regulatory process featured “exhaustive consideration of\ncosts,” post, at 2. All in all, the dissent has at most shown that\nsome elements of the regulatory scheme mitigate cost in limited\nways; it has not shown that these elements ensure\ncost-effectiveness. If (to take a hypothetical example) regulating\npower plants would yield $5 million in benefits, the prospect of\nmitigating cost from $11 billion to $10 billion at later stages of\nthe program would not by itself make regulation appropriate. In all\nevents, we need not pursue these points, because EPA did not say\nthat the parts of the regulatory program mentioned by the dissent\nprevent the imposition of costs far in excess of benefits. “[EPA’s]\naction must be measured by what [it] did, not by what it might have\ndone.” Chenery , supra , at 93–94. D Our reasoning so far establishes that it was\nunreasonable for EPA to read §7412(n)(1)(A) to mean that cost is\nirrelevant to the initial decision to regulate power plants. The\nAgency must consider cost—including, most importantly, cost of\ncompliance—before deciding whether regulation is appropriate and\nnecessary. We need not and do not hold that the law unambiguously\nrequired the Agency, when making this preliminary estimate, to\nconduct a formal cost-benefit analysis in which each advantage and\ndisadvantage is assigned a monetary value. It will be up to the\nAgency to decide (as always, within the limits of reasonable\ninterpretation) how to account for cost. Some of the respondents supporting EPA ask us to\nuphold EPA’s action because the accompanying regulatory impact\nanalysis shows that, once the rule’s ancillary benefits are\nconsidered, benefits plainly outweigh costs. The dissent similarly\nrelies on these ancillary benefits when insisting that “the outcome\nhere [was] a rule whose benefits exceed its costs.” Post, at\n16. As we have just explained, however, we may uphold agency action\nonly upon the grounds on which the agency acted. Even if the Agency could have considered ancillary benefits when deciding\nwhether regulation is appropriate and necessary—a point we need not\naddress—it plainly did not do so here. In the Agency’s own words,\nthe administrative record “utterly refutes [the] assertion that\n[ancillary benefits] form the basis for the appropriate and\nnecessary finding.” 77 Fed. Reg. 9323. The Government concedes,\nmoreover, that “EPA did not rely on the [regulatory impact\nanalysis] when deciding to regulate power plants,” and that “[e]ven\nif EPA had considered costs, it would not necessarily have adopted\n. . . the approach set forth in [that analysis].” Brief\nfor Federal Respondents 53–54. *  *  * We hold that EPA interpreted §7412(n)(1)(A)\nunreasonably when it deemed cost irrelevant to the decision to\nregulate power plants. We reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals for the D. C. Circuit and remand the cases for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered .",

FONT alabama FONT et al. appeal from the united states district court\nfor the middle district of alabama No. 13–895. Argued November 12, 2014—Decided\nMarch 25, 2015[ 1 ] In 2012 Alabama redrew the boundaries of the\nState’s 105 House districts and 35 Senate districts. In doing so,\nwhile Alabama sought to achieve numerous traditional districting\nobjectives— e.g., compactness, not splitting counties or\nprecincts, minimizing change, and protecting incumbents—it placed\nyet greater importance on two goals: (1) minimizing a district’s\ndeviation from precisely equal population, by keeping any deviation\nless than 1% of the theoretical ideal; and (2) seeking to avoid\nretrogression with respect to racial minorities’ “ability to elect\ntheir preferred candidates of choice” under §5 of the Voting Rights\nAct of 1965, 52 U. S. C. §10304(b), by maintaining\nroughly the same black population percentage in existing\nmajority-minority districts. Appellants—Alabama Legislative Black Caucus\n(Caucus), Alabama Democratic Conference (Conference), and\nothers—claim that Alabama’s new district boundaries create a\n“racial gerrymander” in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s\nEqual Protection Clause. After a bench trial, the three-judge\nDistrict Court ruled (2 to 1) for the State. It recognized that\nelectoral districting violates the Equal Protection Clause when\nrace is the “predominant” consideration in deciding “to place a\nsignificant number of voters within or without a particular\ndistrict,” Miller v. Johnson , 515 U. S. 900 ,\nand the use of race is not “narrowly tailored to serve a compelling\nstate interest,” Shaw v. Hunt , 517 U. S. 899\n( Shaw II). In ruling against appellants, it made four\ncritical determinations: (1) that both appellants had argued “that\nthe Acts as a whole constitute racial gerrymanders,” and\nthat the Conference had also argued that the State had racially\ngerrymandered Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, and 26; (2) that the\nConference lacked standing to make its racial gerrymandering\nclaims; (3) that, in any event, appellants’ claims must fail\nbecause race “was not the predominant motivating factor” in making\nthe redistricting decisions; and (4) that, even were it wrong about\nstanding and predominance, these claims must fail because any\npredominant use of race was “narrowly tailored” to serve a\n“compelling state interest” in avoiding retrogression under §5. Held : 1. The District Court’s analysis of the\nracial gerrymandering claim as referring to the State “as a whole,”\nrather than district-by-district, was legally erroneous.\nPp. 5–12. (a) This Court has consistently described\na claim of racial gerrymandering as a claim that race was\nimproperly used in the drawing of the boundaries of one or more specific electoral districts , see, e.g. , Shaw v. Reno , 509 U. S. 630 ( Shaw I ), and\nhas described the plaintiff’s evidentiary burden similarly, see Miller , supra , at 916. The Court’s district-specific\nlanguage makes sense in light of the personal nature of the harms\nthat underlie a racial gerrymandering claim, see Bush v. Vera , 517 U. S. 952 ; Shaw I, supra, at 648.\nPp. 5–6. (b) The District Court found the\nfact that racial criteria had not predominated in the drawing of\nsome Alabama districts sufficient to defeat a claim of racial\ngerrymandering with respect to the State as an\nundifferentiated whole . But a showing that race-based criteria\ndid not significantly affect the drawing of some Alabama\ndistricts would have done little to defeat a claim that race-based\ncriteria predominantly affected the drawing of other Alabama\ndistricts. Thus, the District Court’s undifferentiated statewide\nanalysis is insufficient, and the District Court must on remand\nconsider racial gerrymandering with respect to the individual\ndistricts challenged by appellants. Pp. 7–8. (c) The Caucus and the Conference did not\nwaive the right to further consideration of a district-by-district\nanalysis. The record indicates that plaintiffs’ evidence and\narguments embody the claim that individual majority-minority\ndistricts were racially gerrymandered, and those are the districts\nthat the District Court must reconsider. Although plaintiffs relied\nheavily upon statewide evidence to prove that race predominated in\nthe drawing of individual district lines, neither the use of\nstatewide evidence nor the effort to show widespread effect can\ntransform a racial gerrymandering claim about a set of individual\ndistricts into a separate, general claim that the legislature\nracially gerrymandered the State “as” an undifferentiated “whole.”\nPp. 8–12. 2. The District Court also erred in\ndeciding, sua sponte, that the Conference lacked\nstanding. It believed that the “record” did “not clearly identify\nthe districts in which the individual members of the [Conference]\nreside.” But the Conference’s post-trial brief and the testimony of\na Conference representative support an inference that the\norganization has members in all of the majority-minority districts,\nwhich is sufficient to meet the Conference’s burden of establishing\nstanding. At the very least, the Conference reasonably believed\nthat, in the absence of a state challenge or a court request for\nmore detailed information, it need not provide additional\ninformation such as a specific membership list. While the District\nCourt had an independent obligation to confirm its jurisdiction, in\nthese circumstances elementary principles of procedural fairness\nrequired the District Court, rather than acting sua sponte , to give the Conference an opportunity to\nprovide evidence of member residence. On remand, the District Court\nshould permit the Conference to file its membership list and the\nState to respond, as appropriate. Pp. 12–15. 3. The District Court also did not\nproperly calculate “predominance” in its alternative holding that\n“[r]ace was not the predominant motivating factor” in the creation\nof any of the challenged districts. It reached its conclusion in\npart because it placed in the balance, among other nonracial\nfactors, legislative efforts to create districts of approximately\nequal population. An equal population goal, however, is not one of\nthe “traditional” factors to be weighed against the use of race to\ndetermine whether race “predominates,” see Miller , supra , at 916. Rather, it is part of the redistricting\nbackground, taken as a given, when determining whether race, or\nother factors, predominate in a legislator’s determination as to how equal population objectives will be met. Had the\nDistrict Court not taken a contrary view of the law, its\n“predominance” conclusions, including those concerning the four\ndistricts that the Conference specifically challenged, might well\nhave been different. For example, there is strong, perhaps\noverwhelming, evidence that race did predominate as a factor when\nthe legislature drew the boundaries of Senate District 26.\nPp. 15–19. 4. The District Court’s final alternative\nholding—that “the [challenged] Districts would satisfy strict\nscrutiny”—rests upon a misperception of the law. Section 5 does not\nrequire a covered jurisdiction to maintain a particular numerical\nminority percentage. It requires the jurisdiction to maintain a\nminority’s ability to elect a preferred candidate of choice.\nPp. 19–23. (a) The statute’s language, 52\nU. S. C. §§10304(b), (d), and Department of Justice\nGuidelines make clear that §5 is satisfied if minority voters\nretain the ability to elect their preferred candidates. The history\nof §5 further supports this view, as Congress adopted the language\nin §5 to reject this Court’s decision in Georgia v. Ashcroft , 539 U. S. 461 , and to accept the views of\nJustice Souter’s dissent—that, in a §5 retrogression case, courts\nshould ask whether a new voting provision would likely deprive\nminority voters of their ability to elect a candidate of their\nchoice, and that courts should not mechanically rely upon numerical\npercentages but should take account of all significant\ncircumstances, id., at 493, 498, 505, 509. Here, both the\nDistrict Court and the legislature relied heavily upon a\nmechanically numerical view as to what counts as forbidden\nretrogression. Pp. 19–22. (b) In saying this, this Court does not\ninsist that a state legislature, when redistricting, determine precisely what percent minority population §5 demands. A\ncourt’s analysis of the narrow tailoring requirement insists only\nthat the legislature have a “strong basis in evidence” in support\nof the (race-based) choice that it has made. Brief for United\nStates as Amicus Curiae 29. Here, however, the District\nCourt and the legislature both asked the wrong question with\nrespect to narrow tailoring. They asked how to maintain the present\nminority percentages in majority-minority districts, instead of\nasking the extent to which they must preserve existing minority\npercentages in order to maintain the minority’s present ability to\nelect the candidate of its choice. Because asking the wrong\nquestion may well have led to the wrong answer, the Court cannot\naccept the District Court’s conclusion. Pp. 22–23. 989 F. Supp. 2d 1227, vacated and\nremanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ Nos. 13–895 and 13–1138 _________________ ALABAMA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS, et al., APPELLANTS 13–895 v. ALABAMA et al. ALABAMA DEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE, et al., APPELLANTS 13–1138 v. ALABAMA et al. on appeals from the united states district court for the middle\ndistrict of alabama [March 25, 2015] Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court. The Alabama Legislative Black Caucus and the Alabama Democratic\nConference appeal a three-judge Federal District Court decision\nrejecting their challenges to the lawfulness of Alabama’s 2012\nredistricting of its State House of Representatives and State\nSenate. The appeals focus upon the appellants’ claims that new\ndistrict boundaries create “racial gerrymanders” in violation of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. See, e.g. , Shaw v. Hunt ,517 U. S. 899–908\n(1996) ( Shaw II ) ( Fourteenth Amendment forbids use of race\nas “ ‘predominant’ ” district boundary-drawing\n“ ‘factor’ ” unless boundaries are “narrowly tailored” to\nachieve a “ ‘compelling state interest’ ” (citations\nomitted)). We find that the District Court applied incorrect legal\nstandards in evaluating the claims. We consequently vacate its\ndecision and remand the cases for further proceedings. I The Alabama Constitution requires the legislature to reapportion\nits State House and Senate electoral districts following each\ndecennial census. Ala. Const., Art. IX, §§199–200. In 2012 Alabama\nredrew the boundaries of the State’s 105 House districts and 35\nSenate districts. 2012 Ala. Acts no. 602 (House plan); id., at no. 603 (Senate plan) (Acts). In doing so, Alabama sought to\nachieve numerous traditional districting objectives, such as\ncompactness, not splitting counties or precincts, minimizing\nchange, and protecting incumbents. But it placed yet greater\nimportance on achieving two other goals. See Alabama Legislature\nReapportionment Committee Guidelines in No. 12–cv–691, Doc. 30–4,\npp. 3–5 (Committee Guidelines). First, it sought to minimize the extent to which a district\nmight deviate from the theoretical ideal of precisely equal\npopulation. In particular, it set as a goal creating a set of\ndistricts in which no district would deviate from the theoretical,\nprecisely equal ideal by more than 1%— i.e., a more rigorous\ndeviation standard than our precedents have found necessary under\nthe Constitution. See Brown v. Thomson ,462 U. S.\n835,842 (1983) (5% deviation from ideal generally permissible). No\none here doubts the desirability of a State’s efforts generally to\ncome close to a one-person, one-vote ideal. Second, it sought to ensure compliance with federal law, and, in\nparticular, the Voting Rights Act of 1965.79Stat.439, as amended,52\nU. S. C. §10301 et seq . At the time of the\nredistricting Alabama was a covered jurisdiction under that Act.\nAccordingly §5 of the Act required Alabama to demonstrate that an\nelectoral change, such as redistricting, would not bring about\nretrogression in respect to racial minorities’ “ability\n. . . to elect their preferred candidates of choice.”52\nU. S. C. §10304(b). Specifically, Alabama believed that,\nto avoid retrogression under §5, it was required to maintain\nroughly the same black population percentage in existing\nmajority-minority districts. See Appendix B, infra . Compliance with these two goals posed particular difficulties\nwith respect to many of the State’s 35 majority-minority districts\n(8 in the Senate, 27 in the House). That is because many of these\ndistricts were (compared with the average district) underpopulated.\nIn order for Senate District 26, for example, to meet the State’s\nno-more-than-1% population-deviation objective, the State would\nhave to add about 16,000 individuals to the district. And, prior to\nredistricting, 72.75% of District 26’s population was black.\nAccordingly, Alabama’s plan added 15,785 new individ-uals, and only\n36 of those newly added individuals were white. This suit, as it appears before us, focuses in large part upon\nAlabama’s efforts to achieve these two goals. The Caucus and the\nConference basically claim that the State, in adding so many new\nminority voters to majority-minority districts (and to others),\nwent too far. They allege the State created a constitutionally\nforbidden “racial gerrymander”—a gerrymander that ( e.g. ,\nwhen the State adds more minority voters than needed for a\nminor-ity group to elect a candidate of its choice) might, among\nother things, harm the very minority voters that Acts such as the\nVoting Rights Act sought to help. After a bench trial, the Federal District Court held in favor of\nthe State, i.e. , against the Caucus and the Conference, with\nrespect to their racial gerrymandering claims as well as with\nrespect to several other legal claims that the Caucus and the\nConference had made. With respect to racial gerrymandering, the\nDistrict Court recognized that electoral districting violates the\nEqual Protection Clause when (1) race is the “dominant and\ncontrolling” or “predominant” consideration in deciding “to place a\nsignificant number of voters within or without a particular\ndistrict,” Miller v. Johnson ,515 U. S.\n900,913,916 (1995), and (2) the use of race is not “narrowly\ntailored to serve a compelling state interest,” Shaw II , 517\nU. S., at 902; see also Shaw v. Reno ,509\nU. S. 630,649 (1993) ( Shaw I ) (Constitution\nforbids “separat[ion of ] voters into different districts on\nthe basis of race” when the separation “lacks sufficient\njustification”); Bush v. Vera ,517 U. S. 952–959,\n976 (1996) (principal opinion of O’Connor, J.) (same). But, after\ntrial the District Court held (2 to 1) that the Caucus and the\nConference had failed to prove their racial gerrymandering claims.\nThe Caucus along with the Conference (and several other plaintiffs)\nappealed. We noted probable jurisdiction with respect to the racial\ngerrymandering claims. 572 U. S. ___ (2014). We shall focus upon four critical District Court determinations\nunderlying its ultimate “no violation” conclusion. They\nconcern: The Geographical Nature of the Racial Gerrymandering\nClaims . The District Court characterized the appellants’ claims\nas falling into two categories. In the District Court’s view, both\nappellants had argued “that the Acts as a whole constitute\nracial gerrymanders,” 989 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1287 (MD Ala.\n2013) (emphasis added), and one of the appellants (the Conference)\nhad also argued that the State had racially gerrymandered four\nspecific electoral districts, Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, and 26, id ., at 1288. Standing. The District Court held that the Caucus had\nstanding to argue its racial gerrymandering claim with respect to\nthe State “as a whole.” But the Conference lacked standing to make\nany of its racial gerrymandering claims—the claim requiring\nconsideration of the State “as a whole,” and the claims requiring\nconsideration of four individual Senate districts. Id ., at\n1292. Racial Predominance. The District Court held that, in any\nevent, the appellants’ claims must fail because race “was not the\npredominant motivating factor” either (a) “for the Acts as a whole”\nor (b) with respect to “Senate Districts 7, 11, 22, or 26.” Id ., at 1293. Narrow Tailoring/Compelling State Interest. The District\nCourt also held that, even were it wrong about standing and\npredominance, the appellants’ racial gerrymandering claims must\nfail. That is because any predominant use of race in the drawing of\nelectoral boundaries was “narrowly tailored” to serve a “compelling\nstate interest,” id ., at 1306–1307, namely the interest in\navoiding retrogression with respect to racial minorities’ “ability\nto elect their preferred candidates of choice.” §10304(b). In our view, each of these determinations reflects an error\nabout relevant law. And each error likely affected the District\nCourt’s conclusions—to the point where we must vacate the lower\ncourt’s judgment and remand the cases to allow appellants to\nreargue their racial gerrymandering claims. In light of our\nopinion, all parties remain free to introduce such further evidence\nas the District Court shall reasonably find appropriate. II We begin by considering the geographical nature of the racial\ngerrymandering claims. The District Court repeatedly referred to\nthe racial gerrymandering claims as claims that race improperly\nmotivated the drawing of boundary lines of the State considered\nas a whole . See, e.g. , 989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1293\n(“Race was not the predominant motivating factor for the Acts as a\nwhole”); id ., at 1287 (construing plaintiffs’ challenge as\narguing that the “Acts as a whole constitute racial gerrymanders”); id ., at 1292 (describing the plaintiffs’ challenge as a\n“claim of racial gerrymandering to the Acts as a whole”); cf. supra , at 4–5 (noting four exceptions). A racial gerrymandering claim, however, applies to the\nboundaries of individual districts. It applies\ndistrict-by-district. It does not apply to a State considered as an\nundifferentiated “whole.” We have consistently described a claim of\nracial gerrymandering as a claim that race was improperly used in\nthe drawing of the boundaries of one or more specific\nelectoral districts . See, e.g. , Shaw I ,\n509 U. S., at 649 (violation consists of “separat[ing] voters into different districts on the basis of race” (emphasis\nadded)); Vera , 517 U. S., at 965 (principal opinion)\n(“[Courts] must scrutinize each challenged district . . .” (emphasis added)). We have described the\nplaintiff’s evidentiary burden similarly. See Miller , supra , at 916 (plaintiff must show that “race was the\npredominant factor motivating the legislature’s decision to place a\nsignificant number of voters within or without a particular\ndistrict ” (emphasis added)). Our district-specific language makes sense in light of the\nnature of the harms that underlie a racial gerrymandering claim.\nThose harms are personal. They include being “personally\n. . . subjected to [a] racial classification,” Vera , supra , at 957 (principal opinion), as well as\nbeing represented by a legislator who believes his “primary\nobligation is to represent only the members” of a particular racial\ngroup, Shaw I , supra , at 648. They directly threaten\na voter who lives in the district attacked. But they do not\nso keenly threaten a voter who lives elsewhere in the State.\nIndeed, the latter voter normally lacks standing to pursue a racial\ngerrymandering claim. United States v. Hays ,515\nU. S. 737–745 (1995). Voters, of course, can present statewide evidence in\norder to prove racial gerrymandering in a particular district. See Miller , supra , at 916. And voters might make the\nclaim that every individual district in a State suffers from\nracial gerrymandering. But this latter claim is not the claim that\nthe District Court, when using the phrase “as a whole,” considered\nhere. Rather, the concept as used here suggests the existence of a\nlegal unicorn, an animal that exists only in the legal\nimagination. This is not a technical, linguistic point. Nor does it criticize\nwhat might seem, in effect, a slip of the pen. Rather, here the\nDistrict Court’s terminology mattered. That is because the District\nCourt found that racial criteria had not predominated in the\ndrawing of some Alabama districts. And it found that fact (the fact\nthat race did not predominate in the drawing of some, or many\ndistricts) sufficient to defeat what it saw as the basic claim\nbefore it, namely a claim of racial gerrymandering with respect to\nthe State as an undifferentiated whole . See, e.g. ,\n989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1294 (rejecting plaintiffs’ challenge\nbecause “[the legislature] followed no bright-line rule” with\nrespect to every majority-minority district); id ., at\n1298–1299, 1301 (citing examples of majority-minority districts in\nwhich black population percentages were reduced and examples of\nmajority-white districts in which precincts were split). A showing that race-based criteria did not significantly affect\nthe drawing of some Alabama districts, however, would have\ndone little to defeat a claim that race-based criteria\npredominantly affected the drawing of other Alabama\ndistricts, such as Alabama’s majority-minority districts primarily\nat issue here. See id ., at 1329 (Thompson, J., dissenting)\n(“[T]he drafters[’] fail[ure] to achieve their sought-after\npercentage in one district does not detract one iota from the fact\nthat they did achieve it in another”). Thus, the District Court’s\nundifferentiated statewide analysis is insufficient. And we must\nremand for consideration of racial gerrymandering with respect to\nthe individual districts subject to the appellants’ racial\ngerrymandering challenges. The State and principal dissent argue that (but for four\nspecifically mentioned districts) there were in effect no such\ndistricts. The Caucus and the Conference, the State and principal\ndissent say, did not seek a district-by-district analysis. And, the\nState and principal dissent conclude that the Caucus and the\nConference have consequently waived the right to any further\nconsideration. Brief for Appellees 14, 31; post, at 5–12\n(opinion ofScalia, J.). We do not agree. We concede that the District Court’s opinion\nsuggests that it was the Caucus and the Conference that led the\nCourt to consider racial gerrymandering of the State “as a whole.”\n989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1287. At least the District Court\ninterpreted their filings to allege only that kind of claim. Ibid . But our review of the record indicates that the\nplaintiffs did not claim only that the legislature had racially\ngerrymandered the State “as” an undifferentiated “whole.” Rather,\ntheir evidence and their arguments embody the claim that individual\nmajority-minority districts were racially gerrymandered. And those\nare the districts that we believe the District Court must\nreconsider. There are 35 majority-minority districts, 27 in the House and 8\nin the Senate. The District Court’s opinion itself refers to\nevidence that the legislature’s redistricting committee, in order\nto satisfy what it believed the Voting Rights Act required,\ndeliberately chose additional black voters to move into\nunderpopulated majority-minority districts, i.e., a specific\nset of individual districts. See, e.g. , 989 F. Supp.\n2d, at 1274 (referring to Senator Dial’s testimony that the\nCommittee “could have used,” but did not use, “white population\nwithin Jefferson County to repopulate the majority-black districts”\nbecause “doing so would have resulted in the retrogression of the\nmajority-black districts and potentially created a problem for\n[Justice Department] preclearance”); id ., at 1276 (stating\nthat Representative Jim McClendon, also committee cochair,\n“testified consistently with Senator Dial”); id ., at 1277\n(noting that the committee’s expert, Randolph Hinaman, testified\nthat “he needed to add population” to majority-black districts\n“without significantly lowering the percentage of the population in\neach district that was majority-black”). The Caucus and the Conference presented much evidence at trial\nto show that that the legislature had deliberately moved black\nvoters into these majority-minority districts—again, a specific set\nof districts—in order to prevent the percentage of minority voters\nin each district from declining. See, e.g. , Committee\nGuidelines 3–5; 1 Tr. 28–29, 36–37, 55, 63, 67–68, 77, 81, 96, 115,\n124, 136, 138 (testimony of Senator Dial); Deposition of Gerald\nDial in No. 12–cv–691 (May 21, 2013), Doc. 123–5, pp. 17, 39–41,\n62, 100 (Dial Deposition); 3 Tr. 222 (testimony of Representative\nMcClendon); id ., at 118–119, 145–146, 164, 182–183, 186–187\n(testimony of Hinaman); Deposition of Randolph Hinaman in No.\n12–cv–691 (June 25, 2013), Doc. 134–4, pp. 23–24, 101 (Hinaman\nDeposition). In their post-trial Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of\nLaw, the plaintiffs stated that the evidence showed a racial\ngerrymander with respect to the majority of the majority-minority\ndistricts; they referred to the specific splitting of precinct and\ncounty lines in the drawing of many majority-minority districts;\nand they pointed to much district-specific evidence. E.g. ,\nAlabama Legislative Black Caucus Plaintiffs’ Notice of Filing\nProposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law in No. 12–cv–691,\nDoc. 194, pp. 9–10, 13–14, 30–35, 40 (Caucus Post-Trial Brief);\nNewton Plaintiffs’ Notice of Filing Proposed Findings of Fact and\nConclusions of Law in No. 12–cv–691, Doc. 195, pp. 33–35, 56–61,\n64–67, 69–74, 82–85, 108, 121–122 (Conference Post-Trial Brief);\nsee also Appendix A, infra (organizing these citations by\ndistrict). We recognize that the plaintiffs relied heavily upon statewide\nevidence to prove that race predominated in the drawing of\nindividual district lines. See generally Caucus Post-Trial Brief 1,\n3–7, 48–50; Conference Post-Trial Brief 2, 44–45, 105–106. And they\nalso sought to prove that the use of race to draw the boundaries of\nthe majority-minority districts affected the boundaries of other\ndistricts as well. See, e.g. , 1 Tr. 36–37, 48, 55, 70–71,\n93, 111, 124 (testimony of Dial); 3 Tr. 142, 162 (testimony of\nHinaman); see generally Caucus Post-Trial Brief 8–16. Such evidence\nis perfectly relevant. We have said that the plaintiff’s burden in\na racial gerrymandering case is “to show, either through\ncircumstantial evidence of a district’s shape and demographics or\nmore direct evidence going to legislative purpose, that race was\nthe predominant factor motivating the legislature’s decision to\nplace a significant number of voters within or without a particular\ndistrict.” Miller , 515 U. S., at 916. Cf. Easley v. Cromartie ,532 U. S. 234,258 (2001) (explaining the\nplaintiff’s burden in cases, unlike these, in which the State\nargues that politics, not race, was its predominant motive). That\nAlabama expressly adopted and applied a policy of prioritizing\nmechanical racial targets above all other districting criteria\n(save one-person, one-vote) provides evidence that race motivated\nthe drawing of particular lines in multiple districts in the State.\nAnd neither the use of statewide evidence nor the effort to show\nwidespread effect can transform a racial gerrymandering claim about\na set of individual districts into a separate, general claim that\nthe legislature racially gerrymandered the State “as” an\nundifferentiated “whole.” We, like the principal dissent, recognize that the plaintiffs\ncould have presented their district-specific claims more clearly, post, at 6–8, 10–12 (opinion of Scalia, J.), but the dissent\nproperly concedes that its objection would weaken had the\nConference “developed such a claim in the course of discovery and\ntrial.” Post, at 6. And that is just what happened. In the past few pages and in Appendix A, we set forth the many\nrecord references that establish this fact. The Caucus helps to\nexplain the complaint omissions when it tells us that the\nplaintiffs unearthed the factual basis for their racial\ngerrymandering claims when they deposed the committee’s\nredistricting expert. See Brief for Appellants in No. 13–895, pp.\n12–13. The State neither disputes this procedural history nor\nobjects that plaintiffs’ pleadings failed to conform with the\nproof. Indeed, throughout, the plaintiffs litigated these claims\nnot as if they were wholly separate entities but as if they were a\nteam. See, e.g., Caucus Post-Trial Brief 1 (“[We] support\nthe additional claims made by the [Conference] plaintiffs”); but\ncf. post , at 3–12 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (treating\nseparately Conference claims from Caucus claims). Thus we, like the\ndissenting judge below (who also lived with these cases through\ntrial), conclude that the record as a whole shows that the\nplaintiffs brought, and their argument rested significantly upon,\ndistrict-specific claims. See 989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1313\n(Thompson, J., dissenting) (construing plaintiffs as also\nchallenging “each majority-Black House and Senate District”). The principal dissent adds that the Conference waived its\ndistrict-specific claims on appeal. Cf. post, at 8. But that\nis not so. When asked specifically about its position at oral\nargument, the Conference stated that it was relying on statewide\nevidence to prove its district-specific challenges. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 15–16. Its counsel said that “the exact same policy was\napplied in every black-majority district,” id., at 15, and\n“[b]y statewide, we simply mean a common policy applied to every\ndistrict in the State,” id., at 16. We accept the\nConference’s clarification, which is consistent with how it\npresented these claims below. We consequently conclude that the District Court’s analysis of\nracial gerrymandering of the State “as a whole” was legally\nerroneous. We find that the appellants did not waive their right to\nconsideration of their claims as applied to particular districts.\nAccordingly, we remand the cases. See Pullman-Standard v. Swint ,456 U. S. 273,291 (1982) (remand is required when\nthe District Court “failed to make a finding because of an\nerroneous view of the law”); Rapanos v. United\nStates ,547 U. S. 715,757 (2006) (same). III We next consider the District Court’s holding with respect to\nstanding. The District Court, sua sponte , held that the\nConference lacked standing—either to bring racial gerrymandering\nclaims with respect to the four individual districts that the court\nspecifically considered ( i.e. , Senate Districts 7, 11, 22,\nand 26) or to bring a racial gerrymandering claim with respect to\nthe “State as a whole.” 989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1292. The District Court recognized that ordinarily “[a]n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its\nmembers when its members would have standing to sue in their own\nright , the interests at stake are germane to the organization’s\npurpose, and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested\nrequires individuals members’ participation in the lawsuit.” Id ., at 1291 (quoting Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc. ,528 U. S.\n167,181 (2000); emphasis added). It also recognized that a “member” of an association “would have\nstanding to sue” in his or her “own right” when that member\n“resides in the district that he alleges was the product of a\nracial gerrymander.” 989 F. Supp. 2d, at 1291 (citing Hays , 515 U. S., at 744–745). But, the District Court\nnonetheless denied standing because it believed that the “record”\ndid “not clearly identify the districts in which the individual\nmembers of the [Conference] reside,” and the Conference had “not\nproved that it has members who have standing to pursue any\ndistrict-specific claims of racial gerrymandering.” 989\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1292. The District Court conceded that Dr. Joe Reed, a representative\nof the Conference, testified that the Conference “has membe",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus FOSTER v . CHATMAN, WARDEN certiorari to the supreme court of georgia No. 14–8349. Argued November 2, 2015—Decided\nMay 23, 2016 Petitioner Timothy Foster was convicted of\ncapital murder and sentenced to death in a Georgia court. During\njury selection at his trial, the State used peremptory challenges\nto strike all four black prospective jurors qualified to serve on\nthe jury. Foster argued that the State’s use of those strikes was\nracially motivated, in violation of Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 . The trial court rejected that\nclaim, and the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed. Foster then renewed\nhis Batson claim in a state habeas proceeding. While that\nproceeding was pending, Foster, through the Georgia Open Records\nAct, obtained from the State copies of the file used by the\nprosecution during his trial. Among other documents, the file\ncontained (1) copies of the jury venire list on which the names of\neach black prospective juror were highlighted in bright green, with\na legend indicating that the highlighting “represents Blacks”; (2)\na draft affidavit from an investigator comparing black prospective\njurors and concluding, “If it comes down to having to pick one of\nthe black jurors, [this one] might be okay”; (3) notes identifying\nblack prospective jurors as “B#1,” “B#2,” and “B#3”; (4) notes with\n“N” (for “no”) appearing next to the names of all black prospective\njurors; (5) a list titled “[D]efinite NO’s” containing six names,\nincluding the names of all of the qualified black prospective\njurors; (6) a document with notes on the Church of Christ that\nwas annotated “ NO . No Black Church”; and (7) the\nquestionnaires filled out by five prospective black jurors, on\nwhich each juror’s response indicating his or her race had been\ncircled. The state habeas court denied relief. It noted\nthat Foster’s Batson claim had been adjudicated on direct\nappeal. Because Foster’s renewed Batson claim “fail[ed] to\ndemonstrate purposeful discrimination,” the court concluded that he\nhad failed to show “any change in the facts sufficient to overcome”\nthe state law doctrine of res judicata. The Georgia Supreme Court\ndenied Foster the Certificate of Probable Cause necessary to file\nan appeal. Held : 1. This Court has jurisdiction to review\nthe judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court denying Foster a\nCertificate of Probable Cause on his Batson claim. Although\nthis Court cannot ascertain the grounds for that unelaborated\njudgment, there is no indication that it rested on a state law\nground that is both “independent of the merits” of Foster’s Batson claim and an “adequate basis” for that decision, so\nas to preclude jurisdiction. Harris v. Reed , 489\nU. S. 255 . The state habeas court held that the state law\ndoctrine of res judicata barred Foster’s claim only by examining\nthe entire record and determining that Foster had not alleged a\nchange in facts sufficient to overcome the bar. Based on this\nlengthy “ Batson analysis,” the state habeas court concluded\nthat Foster’s renewed Batson claim was “without merit.”\nBecause the state court’s application of res judicata thus\n“depend[ed] on a federal constitutional ruling, [that] prong of the\ncourt’s holding is not independent of federal law, and [this\nCourt’s] jurisdiction is not precluded.” Ake v. Oklahoma , 470 U. S. 68 ; see also Three Affiliated\nTribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering,\nP. C. , 467 U. S. 138 . Pp. 6–9. 2. The decision that Foster failed to\nshow purposeful discrimination was clearly erroneous.\nPp. 9–25. (a) Batson provides a three-step\nprocess for adjudicating claims such as Foster’s. “First, a\ndefendant must make a prima facie showing that a preemptory\nchallenge has been exercised on the basis of race; second, if that\nshowing has been made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral\nbasis for striking the juror in question; and third, in light of\nthe parties’ submissions, the trial court must determine whether\nthe defendant has shown purposeful discrimination.” Snyder v. Louisiana , 552 U. S. 472 (internal quotation marks\nand brackets omitted). Only Batson ’s third step is at issue\nhere. That step turns on factual findings made by the lower courts,\nand this Court will defer to those findings unless they are clearly\nerroneous. See ibid. Pp. 9–10. (b) Foster established purposeful\ndiscrimination in the State’s strikes of two black prospective\njurors: Marilyn Garrett and Eddie Hood. Though the trial court\naccepted the prosecution’s justifications for both strikes, the\nrecord belies much of the prosecution’s reasoning.\nPp. 10–22. (i) The prosecution explained to the\ntrial court that it made a last-minute decision to strike Garrett\nonly after another juror, Shirley Powell, was excused for cause on\nthe morning that the strikes were exercised. That explanation is\nflatly contradicted by evidence showing that Garrett’s name\nappeared on the prosecution’s list of “[D]efinite NO’s”—the six\nprospective jurors whom the prosecution was intent on striking from\nthe outset. The record also refutes several of the reasons the\nprosecution gave for striking Garrett instead of Arlene Blackmon, a\nwhite prospective juror. For example, while the State told the\ntrial court that it struck Garrett because the defense did not ask\nher for her thoughts about such pertinent trial issues as insanity,\nalcohol, or pre-trial publicity, the record reveals that the\ndefense asked Garrett multiple questions on each topic. And though\nthe State gave other facially reasonable justifications for\nstriking Garrett, those are difficult to credit because of the\nState’s willingness to accept white jurors with the same\ncharacteristics. For example , the prosecution claims that it\nstruck Garrett because she was divorced and, at age 34, too young,\nbut three out of four divorced white prospective jurors and eight\nwhite prospective jurors under age 36 were allowed to serve.\nPp. 11–17. (ii) With regard to prospective juror\nHood, the record similarly undermines the justifications proffered\nby the State to the trial court for the strike. For example, the\nprosecution alleged in response to Foster’s pretrial Batson challenge that its only concern with Hood was the fact that his son\nwas the same age as the defendant. But then, at a subsequent\nhearing, the State told the court that its chief concern was with\nHood’s membership in the Church of Christ. In the end, neither of\nthose reasons for striking Hood withstands scrutiny. As to the age\nof Hood’s son, the prosecution allowed white prospective jurors\nwith sons of similar age to serve, including one who, in contrast\nto Hood, equivocated when asked whether Foster’s age would be a\nfactor at sentencing. And as to Hood’s religion, the prosecution\nerroneously claimed that three white Church of Christ members were\nexcused for cause because of their opposition to the death penalty,\nwhen in fact the record shows that those jurors were excused for\nreasons unrelated to their views on the death penalty. Moreover, a\ndocument acquired from the State’s file contains a handwritten note\nstating, “ NO . NO Black Church,” while asserting that\nthe Church of Christ does not take a stand on the death penalty.\nOther justifications for striking Hood fail to withstand scrutiny\nbecause no concerns were expressed with regard to similar white\nprospective jurors. Pp. 17–23. (c) Evidence that a prosecutor’s reasons\nfor striking a black prospective juror apply equally to an\notherwise similar nonblack prospective juror who is allowed to\nserve tends to suggest purposeful discrimination. Miller-El v. Dretke , 545 U. S. 231 . Such evidence is compelling\nwith respect to Garrett and Hood and, along with the prosecution’s\nshifting explanations, misrepresentations of the record, and\npersistent focus on race, leads to the conclusion that the striking\nof those prospective jurors was “motivated in substantial part by\ndiscriminatory intent.” Snyder , 552 U. S., at 485.\nP. 23. (d) Because Batson was decided\nonly months before Foster’s trial, the State asserts that the focus\non black prospective jurors in the prosecution’s file was an effort\nto develop and maintain a detailed account should the prosecution\nneed a defense against any suggestion that its reasons were\npretextual. That argument, having never before been raised in the\n30 years since Foster’s trial, “reeks of afterthought.” Miller-El , 545 U. S., at 246. And the focus on race in\nthe prosecution’s file plainly demonstrates a concerted effort to\nkeep black prospective jurors off the jury. Pp. 23–25. Reversed and remanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 14–8349 _________________ TIMOTHY TYRONE FOSTER, PETITIONER v. BRUCE CHATMAN, WARDEN on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\ngeorgia [May 23, 2016] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. Petitioner Timothy Foster was convicted of\ncapital murder and sentenced to death in a Georgia court. During\njury selection at his trial, the State exercised peremptory strikes\nagainst all four black prospective jurors qualified to serve.\nFoster argued that the State’s use of those strikes was racially\nmotivated, in violation of our decision in Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 (1986) . The trial court and the\nGeorgia Supreme Court rejected Foster’s Batson claim. Foster then sought a writ of habeas corpus from\nthe Superior Court of Butts County, Georgia, renewing his Batson objection. That court denied relief, and the Georgia\nSupreme Court declined to issue the Certificate of Probable Cause\nnecessary under Georgia law for Foster to pursue an appeal. We\ngranted certiorari and now reverse. I On the morning of August 28, 1986, police\nfound Queen Madge White dead on the floor of her home in Rome,\nGeorgia. White, a 79-year-old widow, had been beaten, sexually\nassaulted, and strangled to death. Her home had been burglarized.\nTimothy Foster subsequently confessed to killing White, and White’s\npossessions were recovered from Foster’s home and from Foster’s two\nsisters. The State indicted Foster on charges of malice murder and\nburglary. He faced the death penalty. Foster v. State , 258 Ga. 736, 374 S. E. 2d 188 (1988). District Attorney Stephen Lanier and Assistant\nDistrict Attorney Douglas Pullen represented the State at trial.\nJury selection proceeded in two phases: removals for cause and\nperemptory strikes. In the first phase, each prospective juror\ncompleted a detailed questionnaire, which the prosecution and\ndefense reviewed. The trial court then conducted a juror-by-juror voir dire of approximately 90 prospective jurors.\nThroughout this process, both parties had the opportunity to\nquestion the prospective jurors and lodge challenges for cause.\nThis first phase whittled the list down to 42 “qualified”\nprospective jurors. Five were black. In the second phase, known as the “striking of\nthe jury,” both parties had the opportunity to exercise peremptory\nstrikes against the array of qualified jurors. Pursuant to state\nlaw, the prosecution had ten such strikes; Foster twenty. See Ga.\nCode Ann. §15–12–165 (1985). The process worked as follows: The\nclerk of the court called the qualified prospective jurors one by\none, and the State had the option to exercise one of its peremptory\nstrikes. If the State declined to strike a particular prospective\njuror, Foster then had the opportunity to do so. If neither party\nexercised a peremptory strike, the prospective juror was selected\nfor service. This second phase continued until 12 jurors had been\naccepted. The morning the second phase began, Shirley\nPowell, one of the five qualified black prospective jurors,\nnotified the court that she had just learned that one of her close\nfriends was related to Foster. The court removed Powell for cause.\nThat left four black prospective jurors: Eddie Hood, Evelyn Hardge,\nMary Turner, and Marilyn Garrett. The striking of the jury then commenced. The\nState exercised nine of its ten allotted peremptory strikes,\nremoving all four of the remaining black prospective jurors. Foster\nimmediately lodged a Batson challenge. The trial court\nrejected the objection and empaneled the jury. The jury convicted\nFoster and sentenced him to death. Following sentencing, Foster renewed his Batson claim in a motion for a new trial. After an\nevidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion. The Georgia\nSupreme Court affirmed, 258 Ga., at 747, 374 S. E. 2d, at 197,\nand we denied certiorari, Foster v. Georgia , 490\nU. S. 1085 (1989) . Foster subsequently sought a writ of habeas\ncorpus from the Superior Court of Butts County, Georgia, again\npressing his Batson claim. While the state habeas proceeding\nwas pending, Foster filed a series of requests under the Georgia\nOpen Records Act, see Ga. Code Ann. §§50–18–70 to 50–18–77 (2002),\nseeking access to the State’s file from his 1987 trial. In\nresponse, the State disclosed documents related to the jury\nselection at that trial. Over the State’s objections, the state\nhabeas court admitted those documents into evidence. They included\nthe following: (1) Four copies of the jury venire list. On each\ncopy, the names of the black prospective jurors were highlighted in\nbright green. A legend in the upper right corner of the lists\nindicated that the green highlighting “represents Blacks.” See, e.g. , App. 253. The letter “B” also appeared next to each\nblack prospective juror’s name. See, e.g., ibid .\nAccording to the testimony of Clayton Lundy, an investigator who\nassisted the prosecution during jury selection, these highlighted\nvenire lists were circulated in the district attorney’s office\nduring jury selection. That allowed “everybody in the\noffice”—approximately “10 to 12 people,” including “[s]ecretaries,\ninvestigators, [and] district attorneys”—to look at them, share\ninformation, and contribute thoughts on whether the prosecution\nshould strike a particular juror. Pl. Exh. 1, 2 Record 190, 219\n(Lundy deposition) (hereinafter Tr.). The documents, Lundy\ntestified, were returned to Lanier before jury selection. Id., at 220. (2) A draft of an affidavit that had been\nprepared by Lundy “at Lanier’s request” for submission to the state\ntrial court in response to Foster’s motion for a new trial. Id., at 203. The typed draft detailed Lundy’s views on ten\nblack prospective jurors, stating “[m]y evaluation of the jurors\nare a[s] follows.” App. 343. Under the name of one of those jurors,\nLundy had written: “If it comes down to having to pick one of\nthe black jurors, [this one] might be okay. This is solely my\nopinion. . . . Upon picking of the jury after\nlistening to all of the jurors we had to pick, if we had to pick a\nblack juror I recommend that [this juror] be one of the jurors.” Id ., at 345 (paragraph break omitted). That text had been crossed out by hand; the\nversion of the affidavit filed with the trial court did not contain\nthe crossed-out language. See id ., at 127–129. Lundy\ntestified that he “guess[ed]” the redactions had been done by\nLanier. Tr. 203. (3) Three handwritten notes on black prospective\njurors Eddie Hood, Louise Wilson, and Corrie Hinds. Annotations\ndenoted those individuals as “B#1,” “B#2,” and “B#3,” respectively.\nApp. 295–297. Lundy testified that these were examples of the type\nof “notes that the team—the State would take down during\nvoir dire to help select the jury in Mr. Foster’s case.” Tr.\n208–210. (4) A typed list of the qualified jurors\nremaining after voir dire . App. 287–290. It included\n“Ns” next to ten jurors’ names, which Lundy told the state habeas\ncourt “signif[ied] the ten jurors that the State had strikes for\nduring jury selection.” Tr. 211. Such an “N” appeared alongside the\nnames of all five qualified black prospective jurors. See App.\n287–290. The file also included a handwritten version of the same\nlist, with the same markings. Id ., at 299–300; see Tr. 212.\nLundy testified that he was unsure who had prepared or marked the\ntwo lists. (5) A handwritten document titled “definite\nNO’s,” listing six names. The first five were those of the five\nqualified black prospective jurors. App. 301. The State concedes\nthat either Lanier or Pullen compiled the list, which Lundy\ntestified was “used for preparation in jury selection.” Tr. 215;\nTr. of Oral Arg. 45. (6) A handwritten document titled “Church of\nChrist.” A notation on the document read: “ NO . No Black Church.” App. 302. (7) The questionnaires that had been completed\nby several of the black prospective jurors. On each one, the\njuror’s response indicating his or her race had been circled. Id., at 311, 317, 323, 329, 334. In response to the admission of this evidence,\nthe State introduced short affidavits from Lanier and Pullen.\nLanier’s affidavit stated: “I did not make any of the highlighted\nmarks on the jury venire list. It was common practice in the office\nto highlight in yellow those jurors who had prior case experience.\nI did not instruct anyone to make the green highlighted marks. I\nreaffirm my testimony made during the motion for new trial hearing\nas to how I used my peremptory jury strikes and the basis and\nreasons for those strikes.” Id. , at 169 (paragraph numeral\nomitted). Pullen’s affidavit averred: “I did not make any of the highlighted\nmarks on the jury venire list, and I did not instruct anyone else\nto make the highlighted marks. I did not rely on the highlighted\njury venire list in making my decision on how to use my peremptory\nstrikes.” Id ., at 170–171 (paragraph numeral omitted). Neither affidavit provided further explanation\nof the documents, and neither Lanier nor Pullen testified in the\nhabeas proceeding. After considering the evidence, the state habeas\ncourt denied relief. The court first stated that, “[a]s a\npreliminary matter,” Foster’s Batson claim was “not\nreviewable based on the doctrine of res judicata” because it had\nbeen “raised and litigated adversely to [Foster] on his direct\nappeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.” App. 175. The court\nnonetheless announced that it would “mak[e] findings of fact and\nconclusions of law” on that claim. Id., at 191. Based on\nwhat it referred to as a “ Batson . . . analysis,”\nthe court concluded that Foster’s “renewed Batson claim is\nwithout merit,” because he had “fail[ed] to demonstrate purposeful\ndiscrimination.” Id., at 192, 195, 196. The Georgia Supreme Court denied Foster the\n“Certificate of Probable Cause” necessary under state law for him\nto pursue an appeal, determining that his claim had no “arguable\nmerit.” Id. , at 246; see Ga. Code Ann. §9–14–52 (2014); Ga.\nSup. Ct. Rule 36 (2014). We granted certiorari. 575 U. S. ___\n(2015). II Before turning to the merits of Foster’s Batson claim, we address a threshold issue. Neither party\ncontests our jurisdiction to review Foster’s claims, but we “have\nan independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter\njurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any\nparty.” Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp. , 546 U. S.\n500, 514 (2006) . This Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a\nfederal claim on review of a state court judgment “if that judgment\nrests on a state law ground that is both ‘independent’ of the\nmerits of the federal claim and an ‘adequate’ basis for the court’s\ndecision.” Harris v. Reed , 489 U. S. 255, 260\n(1989) . The state habeas court noted that Foster’s Batson claim was “not reviewable based on the doctrine of\nres judicata” under Georgia law. App. 175. The Georgia Supreme\nCourt’s unelaborated order on review provides no reasoning for its\ndecision.[ 1 ] That raises the\nquestion whether the Georgia Supreme Court’s order—the judgment\nfrom which Foster sought certiorari[ 2 ]—rests on an adequate and independent state law ground\nso as to preclude our jurisdiction over Foster’s federal claim. We conclude that it does not. When application\nof a state law bar “depends on a federal constitutional ruling, the\nstate-law prong of the court’s holding is not independent of\nfederal law, and our jurisdiction is not precluded.” Ake v. Oklahoma , 470 U. S. 68, 75 (1985) ; see also Three\nAffiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation v. Wold\nEngineering, P. C. , 467 U. S. 138, 152 (1984) . In this case, the Georgia habeas court’s\nanalysis in the section of its opinion labeled “ Batson claim” proceeded as follows: “The [State] argues that this claim is not\nreviewable due to the doctrine of res judicata. However, because\n[Foster] claims that additional evidence allegedly supporting this\nground was discovered subsequent to the Georgia Supreme Court’s\nruling [on direct appeal], this court will review the Batson claim as to whether [Foster] has shown any change in the facts\nsufficient to overcome the res judicata bar.” App. 192. To determine whether Foster had alleged a\nsufficient “change in the facts,” the habeas court engaged in four\npages of what it termed a “ Batson . . . analysis,”\nin which it evaluated the original trial record and habeas record,\nincluding the newly uncovered prosecution file. Id., at\n192–196. Ultimately, that court concluded that Foster’s “renewed Batson claim is without merit .” Id., at 196\n(emphasis added). In light of the foregoing, it is apparent that\nthe state habeas court’s application of res judicata to Foster’s Batson claim was not independent of the merits of his\nfederal constitutional challenge.[ 3 ] That court’s invocation of res judicata therefore poses\nno impediment to our review of Foster’s Batson claim. See Ake , 470 U. S., at 75.[ 4 ] III A The “Constitution forbids striking even a\nsingle prospective juror for a discriminatory purpose.” Snyder v. Louisiana , 552 U. S. 472, 478 (2008)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Our decision in Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U. S. 79 , provides a three-step\nprocess for determining when a strike is discriminatory: “First, a defendant must make a prima\nfacie showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the\nbasis of race; second, if that showing has been made, the\nprosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror\nin question; and third, in light of the parties’ submissions, the\ntrial court must determine whether the defendant has shown\npurposeful discrimination.” Snyder , 552 U. S., at\n476–477 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Both parties agree that Foster has demonstrated\na prima facie case, and that the prosecutors have offered\nrace-neutral reasons for their strikes. We therefore address only Batson ’s third step. That step turns on factual\ndeterminations, and, “in the absence of exceptional circumstances,”\nwe defer to state court factual findings unless we conclude that\nthey are clearly erroneous. Synder , 552 U. S., at\n477. Before reviewing the factual record in this\ncase, a brief word is in order regarding the contents of the\nprosecution’s file that Foster obtained through his Georgia Open\nRecords Act requests. Pursuant to those requests, Foster received a\n“certif[ied] . . . true and correct copy of 103 pages of\nthe State’s case file” from his 1987 trial. App. 247. The State\nargues that “because [Foster] did not call either of the\nprosecutors to the stand” to testify in his state habeas\nproceedings, “he can only speculate as to the meaning of various\nmarkings and writings” on thosepages, “the author of many of them,\nand whether the twoprosecutors at trial (District Attorney Lanier\nand Assistant District Attorney Pullen) even saw many of them.”\nBrief for Respondent 20. For these reasons, the State argues, “none\nof the specific pieces of new evidence [found in the file] shows an\nintent to discriminate.” Ibid. (capitalization omitted). For\nhis part, Foster argues that “[t]here is no question that the\nprosecutors used the lists and notes, which came from the\nprosecution’s file and were certified as such,” and therefore the\n“source of the lists and notes, their timing, and their purpose is\nhardly ‘unknown’ or based on ‘conjecture.’ ” Reply Brief 4–5\n(quoting Brief for Respondent 27–28). The State concedes that the prosecutors\nthemselves authored some documents, see, e.g. , Tr. of Oral\nArg. 45 (admitting that one of the two prosecutors must have\nwritten the list titled “definite NO’s”), and Lundy’s testimony\nstrongly suggests that the prosecutors viewed others, see, e.g. , Tr. 220 (noting that the highlighted jury venire lists\nwere returned to Lanier prior to jury selection). There are,\nhowever, genuine questions that remain about the provenance of\nother documents. Nothing in the record, for example, identifies the\nauthor of the notes that listed three black prospective jurors as\n“B#1,” “B#2,” and “B#3.” Such notes, then, are not necessarily\nattributable directly to the prosecutors themselves. The state\nhabeas court was cognizant of those limitations, but nevertheless\nadmitted the file into evidence, reserving “a determination as to\nwhat weight the Court is going to put on any of [them]” in light of\nthe objections urged by the State. 1 Record 20. We agree with that approach. Despite questions\nabout the background of particular notes, we cannot accept the\nState’s invitation to blind ourselves to their existence. We have\n“made it clear that in considering a Batson objection, or in\nreviewing a ruling claimed to be Batson error, all of the\ncircumstances that bear upon the issue of racial animosity must be\nconsulted.” Snyder, 552 U. S., at 478. As we have said\nin a related context, “[d]etermining whether invidious\ndiscriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive\ninquiry into such circumstantial . . . evidence of intent\nas may be available.” Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan\nHousing Development Corp. , 429 U. S. 252, 266 (1977) . At\na minimum, we are comfortable that all documents in the file were\nauthored by someone in the district attorney’s office. Any\nuncertainties concerning the documents are pertinent only as\npotential limits on their probative value. B Foster centers his Batson claim on the\nstrikes of two black prospective jurors, Marilyn Garrett and Eddie\nHood. We turn first to Marilyn Garrett. According to Lanier, on the\nmorning that the State was to use its strikes he had not yet made\nup his mind to remove Garrett. Rather, he decided to strike her\nonly after learning that he would not need to use a strike on\nanother black prospective juror, Shirley Powell, who was excused\nfor cause that morning. Ultimately, Lanier did strike Garrett. In\njustifying that strike to the trial court, he articulated a laundry\nlist of reasons. Specifically, Lanier objected to Garrett because\nshe: (1) worked with disadvantaged youth in her job as a teacher’s\naide; (2) kept looking at the ground during voir dire ;\n(3) gave short and curt answers during voir dire ; (4)\nappeared nervous; (5) was too young; (6) misrepresented her\nfamiliarity with the location of the crime; (7) failedto disclose\nthat her cousin had been arrested on a drug charge; (8) was\ndivorced; (9) had two children and two jobs; (10) was asked few\nquestions by the defense; and (11) did not ask to be excused from\njury service. See App. 55–57 (pretrial hearing); id. , at\n93–98, 105, 108, 110–112 (new trial hearing); Record in No. 45609\n(Ga. 1988), pp. 439–440 (hereinafter Trial Record) (brief in\nopposition to new trial). The trial court accepted Lanier’s\njustifications, concluding that “[i]n the totality of\ncircumstances,” there was “no discriminatory intent, and that there\nexisted reasonably clear, specific, and legitimate reasons” for the\nstrike. App. 143. On their face, Lanier’s justifications for the\nstrike seem reasonable enough. Our independent examination of the\nrecord, however, reveals that much of the reasoning provided by\nLanier has no grounding in fact. Lanier’s misrepresentations to the trial court\nbegan with an elaborate explanation of how he ultimately came to\nstrike Garrett: “[T]he prosecution considered this juror\n[to have] the most potential to choose from out of the four\nremaining blacks in the 42 [member] panel venire. However, a system\nof events took place on the morning of jury selection that caused\nthe excusal of this juror. The [S]tate had, in his jury notes, listed this juror as questionable . The four negative\nchallenges were allocated for Hardge, Hood, Turner and\nPowell. . . . But on the morning of jury selection,\nJuror Powell was excused for cause with no objections by [d]efense\ncounsel. She was replaced by Juror Cadle [who] was acceptable to\nthe State. This left the State with an additional strike it had not\nanticipated or allocated. Consequently, the State had to choose\nbetween [white] Juror Blackmon or Juror Garrett, the only two questionable jurors the State had left on the list.” Trial\nRecord 438–440 (brief in opposition to new trial) (emphasis added\nand citations omitted). Lanier then offered an extensive list of reasons\nfor striking Garrett and explained that “[t]hese factors, with no\nreference to race, were considered by the prosecutor in this\nparticular case to result in a juror less desirable from the\nprosecutor’s viewpoint than Juror Blackmon.” Id., at 441\n(emphasis deleted). Lanier then compared Blackmon to Garrett. In\ncontrast to Garrett, Juror Blackmon “was 46 years old, married 13 years to her\nhusband who works at GE, buying her own home and [was recommended\nby a third party to] this prosecutor. She was no longer employed at\nNorthwest Georgia Regional Hospital and she attended Catholic\nchurch on an irregular basis. She did not hesitate when answering\nthe questions concerning the death penalty, had good eye contact\nwith the prosecutor and gave good answers on the insanity issue.\nShe was perceived by the prosecutor as having a stable home\nenvironment, of the right age and no association with any\ndisadvantaged youth organizations.” Ibid. Lanier concluded that “the chances of [Blackmon]\nreturning a death sentence were greater when all these factors were\nconsidered than Juror Garrett. Consequently, Juror Garrett was\nexcused.” Ibid. The trial court accepted this explanation in\ndenying Foster’s motion for a new trial. See App. 142–143. But the\npredicate for the State’s account—that Garrett was “listed” by the\nprosecution as “questionable,” making that strike a last-minute\nrace-neutral decision—was false. During jury selection, the State went first. As\na consequence, the defense could accept any prospective juror not\nstruck by the State without any further opportunity for the State\nto use a strike against that prospective juror. Accordingly, the\nState had to “pretty well select the ten specific people [it]\nintend[ed] to strike” in advance. Id. , at 83 (pretrial\nhearing); accord, ibid. (“[T]he ten people that we felt very\nuncomfortable with, we have to know up front.” (Lanier testimony)).\nThe record evidence shows that Garrett was one of those “ten\nspecific people.” That much is evident from the “definite NO’s”\nlist in the prosecution’s file. Garrett’s name appeared on that\nlist, which the State concedes was written by one of the\nprosecutors. Tr. of Oral Arg. 45. That list belies Lanier’s\nassertion that the State considered allowing Garrett to serve. The\ntitle of the list meant what it said: Garrett was a\n“ definite NO.” App. 301 (emphasis added). The State from the\noutset was intent on ensuring that none of the jurors on\nthat list would serve. The first five names on the “definite NO’s” list\nwere Eddie Hood, Evelyn Hardge, Shirley Powell, Marilyn Garrett,\nand Mary Turner. All were black. The State struck each one except\nPowell (who, as discussed, was excused for cause at the last\nminute—though the prosecution informed the trial court that the\n“State was not, under any circumstances, going to take [Powell],”\nTrial Record 439 (brief in opposition to new trial)). Only in the\nnumber six position did a white prospective juror appear, and she\nhad informed the court during voir dire that she could\nnot “say positively” that she could impose the death penalty even\nif the evidence warranted it. 6 Tr. in No. 86–2218–2 (Super. Ct.\nFloyd Cty., Ga., 1987), p. 1152 (hereinafter Trial Transcript); see\nalso id., at 1153–1158. In short, contrary to the\nprosecution’s submissions, the State’s resolve to strike Garrett\nwas never in doubt. See also App. 290 (“N” appears next to\nGarrett’s name on juror list); id., at 300 ",

SAMUELS et al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the district of columbia circuit No. 14–844. Argued November 4, 2015—Decided\nJanuary 12, 2016 The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nprovides that prisoners qualified to proceed in forma\npauperis (IFP) must nonetheless pay an initial partial filing\nfee, set as “20 percent of the greater of” the average monthly\ndeposits in the prisoner’s account or the average monthly balance\nof the account over the preceding six months. 28 U. S. C.\n§1915(b)(1). They must then pay the remainder of the fee in monthly\ninstallments of “20 percent of the preceding month’s income\ncredited to the prisoner’s account.” §1915(b)(2). The initial\npartial fee is assessed on a per-case basis, i.e., each time\nthe prisoner files a lawsuit. The initial payment may not be\nexacted if the prisoner has no means to pay it, §1915(b)(4), and no\nmonthly installments are required unless the prisoner has more than\n$10 in his account, §1915(b)(2). In contest here is the calculation\nof subsequent monthly installment payments when more than one fee\nis owed. Petitioner Antoine Bruce, a federal inmate and\na frequent litigant, argued that the monthly filing-fee payments do\nnot become due until filing-fee obligations previously incurred in\nother cases are satisfied. The D. C. Circuit disagreed,\nholding that Bruce’s monthly payments were due simultaneously with\nmonthly payments in the earlier cases. Held : Section 1915(b)(2) calls for\nsimultaneous, not sequential, recoupment of multiple monthly\ninstallment payments. Pp. 5–8. (a) Bruce and the Government present\ncompeting interpretations of the IFP statute, which does not\nexplicitly address how multiple filing fees should be paid. In\nurging a per-prisoner approach under which he would pay 20 percent\nof his monthly income regardless of the number of cases he has\nfiled, Bruce relies principally on the contrast between the\nsingular “clerk” and the plural “fees” as those nouns appear in\n§1915(b)(2), which requires payments to be forwarded “to the clerk\nof the court . . . until the filing fees are paid.” Even\nwhen more than one filing fee is owed, Bruce contends, §1915(b)(2)\ninstructs that only one clerk will receive payment each month. In\ncontrast, the Government urges a per-case approach. Emphasizing\nthat §1915 as a whole has a single-case focus, providing\ninstructions for each case, the Government contends that it\nwould be anomalous to treat paragraph (b)(1)’s initial partial\npayment, admittedly directed at a single case, differently than\nparagraph (b)(2)’s subsequent monthly payments. Pp. 5–7. (b) Section 1915’s text and context\nsupport the per-case approach. Just as §1915(b)(1) calls for\nassessment of “ an initial partial filing fee” each time a\nprisoner “brings a civil action or files an appeal”\n(emphasis added), so its allied provision, §1915(b)(2), calls for\nmonthly 20 percent payments simultaneously for each action pursued.\nSection 1915(b)(3), which imposes a ceiling on fees permitted “for\nthe commencement of a civil action or an appeal”\n(emphasis added), and §1915(b)(4), which protects the right to\nbring “ a civil action or appea[l] a . . .\njudgment” (emphasis added), confirm that subsection (b) as a whole\nis written from the perspective of a single case. Pp. 7–8. 761 F. 3d 1, affirmed. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion for a\nunanimous Court. NOTICE: This opinion is subject to\nformal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the\nUnited States Reports. Readers are requested to notify the Reporter\nof Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington,\nD. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in\norder that corrections may be made before the preliminary print\ngoes to press. SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 14–844 _________________ ANTOINE BRUCE, PETITIONER v. CHARLES E.\nSAMUELS, JR., et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the district of columbia circuit [January 12, 2016] Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case concerns the payment of filing fees\nfor civil actions commenced by prisoners in federal courts. Until\n1996, indigent prisoners, like other indigent persons, could file a\ncivil action without paying any filing fee. See 28\nU. S. C. §1915(a)(1). In the Prison Litigation Reform Act\nof 1995 (PLRA), 110Stat. 1321–66, Congress placed several\nlimitations on prisoner litigation in federal courts. Among those\nlimitations, Congress required prisoners qualified to proceed in\nforma pauperis nevertheless to pay an initial partial filing\nfee. That fee is statutorily set as “20 percent of the greater of”\nthe average monthly deposits in the prisoner’s account or the\naverage monthly balance of the account over the preceding six\nmonths. §1915(b)(1). Thereafter, to complete payment of the filing\nfee, prisoners must pay, in monthly installments, “20 percent of\nthe preceding month’s income credited to the prisoner’s account.”\n§1915(b)(2). The initial partial filing fee may not be exacted if\nthe prisoner has no means to pay it, §1915(b)(4), and no monthly\ninstallments are required unless the prisoner has more than $10 in\nhis account, §1915(b)(2). It is undisputed that the initial partial filing\nfee is to be assessed on a per-case basis, i.e., each time\nthe prisoner files a lawsuit. In contest here is the calculation of\nsubsequent monthly installment payments. Petitioner Antoine Bruce\nurges a per-prisoner approach under which he would pay 20 percent\nof his monthly income regardless of the number of cases he has\nfiled. The Government urges, and the court below followed, a\nper-case approach under which a prisoner would pay 20 percent of\nhis monthly income for each case he has filed. Courts of Appeals\nhave divided on which of these two approaches §1915(b)(2)\norders.[ 1 ] To resolve the\nconflict, we granted certiorari. 576 U. S. ___ (2015). We hold that monthly installment payments, like\nthe initial partial payment, are to be assessed on a per-case\nbasis. Nothing in §1915’s current design supports treating a\nprisoner’s second or third action unlike his first lawsuit. I A In 1892, Congress enacted the in forma\npauperis (IFP) statute, now codified at 28 U. S. C.\n§1915, “to ensure that indigent litigants have meaningful access to\nthe federal courts.” Neitzke v. Williams , 490\nU. S. 319, 324 (1989) . Reacting to “a sharp rise in prisoner\nlitigation,” Woodford v. Ngo , 548 U. S. 81, 84\n(2006) , Congress in 1996 enacted the PLRA, which installed a\nvariety of measures “designed to filter out the bad claims [filed\nby prisoners] and facilitate consideration of the good,” Coleman v. Tollefson , 575 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 3) (quoting Jones v. Bock , 549\nU. S. 199, 204 (2007) ; alteration in original). Among those measures, Congress required\nprisoners to pay filing fees for the suits or appeals they launch.\nThe provisions on fee payment, set forth in §1915(b), read: “(1) . . . [I]f a prisoner brings a\ncivil action or files an appeal in forma pauperis, the prisoner\nshall be required to pay the full amount of a filing fee. The court\nshall assess and, when funds exist, collect, as a partial payment\nof any court fees required by law, an initial partial filing fee of\n20 percent of the greater of— “(A) the average monthly deposits to the\nprisoner’s account; or “(B) the average monthly balance in the\nprisoner’s account for the 6-month period immediately preceding the\nfiling of the complaint or notice of appeal. “(2) After payment of the initial partial filing\nfee, the prisoner shall be required to make monthly payments of 20\npercent of the preceding month’s income credited to the prisoner’s\naccount. The agency having custody of the prisoner shall forward\npayments from the prisoner’s account to the clerk of the court each\ntime the amount in the account exceeds $10 until the filing fees\nare paid.” The monthly installment scheme described in\n§1915(b)(2) also applies to costs awarded against prisoners when\nthey are judgment losers. §1915(f)(2)(B). To further contain prisoner litigation, the PLRA\nintroduced a three-strikes provision: Prisoners whose suits or\nappeals are dismissed three or more times as frivolous, malicious,\nor failing to state a claim on which relief may be granted are\nbarred from proceeding IFP “unless the prisoner is under imminent\ndanger of serious physical injury.” §1915(g). In other words, for\nmost three strikers, all future filing fees become payable in full\nupfront. Congress included in its 1996 overhaul of §1915\na safety-valve provision to ensure that the fee requirementswould\nnot bar access to the courts: “In no event shall a prisoner be\nprohibited from bringing a civil action or appealing a civil or\ncriminal judgment for the reason that the prisoner has no assets\nand no means by which to pay the initial partial filing fee.”\n§1915(b)(4). B Petitioner Antoine Bruce, a federal inmate\nserving a 15-year sentence, is a frequent litigant.[ 2 ] In the instant case, Bruce challenges his\nplacement in a special management unit at the Federal Correctional\nInstitution in Talladega, Alabama. Pinson v. Samuels ,\n761 F. 3d 1, 3–4 (CADC 2014).[ 3 ] Bruce had previously incurred filing-fee obligations in\nother cases and maintained that the monthly filing-fee payments for\nthis case would not become due until those prior obligations were\nsatisfied. Id., at 4, 7. The Court of Appeals for the\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit, whose decision is before us for\nreview, rejected Bruce’s argument. Id., at 8–10. Bruce must\nmake monthly filing-fee payments in this case, the court held,\nsimultaneously with such payments in earlier commenced cases. Id., at 8. We agree with the appeals court that §1915(b)(2)\ncalls for simultaneous, not sequential, recoupment of multiple\nfiling fees. II The IFP statute does not explicitly address\nwhether multiple filing fees (after the initial partial payment)\nshould be paid simultaneously or sequentially. Bruce and the\nGovernment present competing interpretations. A In support of the per-prisoner approach, Bruce\nrelies principally on what he sees as a significant contrast\nbetween the singular “clerk” and the plural “fees” as those nouns\nappear in 28 U. S. C. §1915(b)(2). That provision\nrequires payments to be forwarded “to the clerk of the\ncourt . . . until the filing fees are\npaid.” Ibid. (empha-sis added). Even when more than one\nfiling fee isowed, Bruce contends, the statute instructs that only\none clerk will receive payment each month; in other words,fee\npayments are to be made sequentially rather than\nsimultaneously. The initial partial payment, which is charged on\na per-case basis, plus the three-strikes provision, Bruce urges,\ntogether suffice to satisfy the PLRA’s purpose, which is to “force\nprisoners to think twice about the case and not just file\nreflexively,” 141 Cong. Rec. 14572 (1995) (remarks of Sen. Kyl).\nThe additional economic disincentive that the per-case approach\nwould occasion, Bruce asserts, could excessively encumber access to\nfederal courts. Furthermore, Bruce points out, the per-case\napproach breaks down when a prisoner incurs more than five\nobligations. Nothing will be left in the account to pay the sixth\nfee, Bruce observes. Necessarily, therefore, its payment will be\nentirely deferred. Why treat the second obligation unlike the\nsixth, Bruce asks. Isn’t the statute sensibly read to render all\nmonthly payments sequential? Bruce notes in this regard that, under\nthe per-case approach, his ability to use his account to purchase\namenities will be progressively curtailed; indeed, the account\nmight be reduced to zero upon his filing or joining a fifth\ncase. Finally, Bruce argues, administrative\ndifficulties counsel against the per-case approach. Costs could\ndwarf the monetary yield if prisons, under a per-case regime, were\nobliged to send as many as five checks to five different courts\neach month. And the problems faced by state-prison officials—who\nsometimes must choose which of several claims on a prisoner’s\nincome ( e.g., child-support, medical copayments) should take\nprecedence—would be exacerbated under a system demanding\nsimultaneous payment of multiple litigation charges. B The Government emphasizes that §1915 as a\nwhole has a single-case focus, providing instructions for each case. It would be anomalous, the Government urges, to\ntreat paragraph (b)(1)’s initial partial payment, which Bruce\nconcedes is directed at a single case, differently than paragraph\n(b)(2)’s subsequent monthly payments. The two paragraphs, the\nGovernment observes, are linked by paragraph (b)(2)’s opening\nclause: “After payment of the initial partial filing fee.” The per-case approach, the Government adds,\nbetter comports with the purpose of the PLRA to deter frivolous\nsuits. See Newlin v. Helman , 123 F. 3d 429, 436\n(CA7 1997) (Easterbrook, J.) (“Otherwise a prisoner could file\nmultiple suits for the price of one, postponing payment of the fees\nfor later-filed suits until after the end of imprisonment (and\nlikely avoiding them altogether [because fees are often\nuncollectable on a prisoner’s release]).”), overruled in part on\nother grounds by Lee v. Clinton , 209 F. 3d 1025\n(CA7 2000), and Walker v. O’Brien , 216 F. 3d 626\n(CA7 2000). The Government further observes that the generally\nsmall size of the initial partial fee—here, $0.64, App. to Pet. for\nCert. 21a—provides scant disincentive, on its own, for multiple\nfilings. Responding to Bruce’s observation that, for a\nprisoner with more than five charges, even the per-case approach\nresorts to sequential payments, the Government agrees, but tells us\nthat this scenario arises infrequently. “[M]ost prisoners,” the\nGovernment states, “would accrue three strikes (and therefore be\nrequired to pay the full filing fees upfront) by the time they\nincurred the obligation for their sixth case.” Brief for\nRespondents 29. Finally, answering Bruce’s concern that the\nper-case approach could leave a prisoner without money for\namenities, the Government points out that prisons “are\nconstitutionally bound to provide inmates with adequate food,\nclothing, shelter, and medical care,” id., at 48 (citing Farmer v. Brennan , 511 U. S. 825, 832 (1994) ),\nand must furnish “ ‘paper and pen to draft legal documents’\nand ‘stamps to mail them,’ ” Brief for Respondents 48 (quoting Bounds v. Smith , 430 U. S. 817, 824, 825 (1977)\n). More-over, the Government notes, the Federal Bureau of Prisons\n(BOP) “goes beyond those requirements,” providing inmates “articles\nnecessary for maintaining personal hygiene,” and free postage “not\nonly for legal mailings but also to enable the inmate to maintain\ncommunity ties.” Brief for Respondents 48, n. 21 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). III The Circuits following the per-case approach,\nwe conclude, better comprehend the statute. Just as §1915(b)(1)\ncalls for assessment of “ an initial partial filing fee” each\ntime a prisoner “brings a civil action or files an appeal” (emphasis added), so its allied provision, §1915(b)(2),\ntriggered immediately after, calls for “monthly payments of 20\npercent of the preceding month’s income” simultaneously for each\naction pursued. The other two paragraphs of §1915(b) confirm that\nthe subsection as a whole is written from the perspective of a\nsingle case. See §1915(b)(3) (imposing a ceiling on fees permitted\n“for the commencement of a civil action or an appeal”\n(emphasis added)); §1915(b)(4) (protecting the right to “brin[g] a civil action or appea[l] a civil or criminal\njudgment” (emphasis added)). There is scant indication that the\nstatute’s perspective shifts partway through paragraph\n(2).[ 4 ] Bruce’s extratextual points do not warrant a\ndeparture from the interpretation suggested by the text and\ncontext. The per-case approach more vigorously serves the statutory\nobjective of containing prisoner litigation, while the safety-valve\nprovision, see supra, at 4, ensures against denial of access\nto federal courts. Bruce’s administrability concerns carry little\nweight given reports from several States that the per-case approach\nis unproblematic. See Brief for State of Michigan et al. as Amici Curiae 18–20. *  *  * For the reasons stated, the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is Affirmed. Notes 1 Compare Atchison v. Collins , 288 F. 3d 177, 181 (CA5 2002) ( per\ncuriam ); Newlin v. Helman , 123 F. 3d 429,\n436 (CA7 1997), overruled in part on other grounds by Lee v.

O’Quinn , 612 F. 3d 237, 241–248 (CA4\n2010) (adopting per-prisoner approach). 2 At oral argument, Bruce’s\ncounsel informed the Court that Bruce had framed or joined 19\nprison-litigation cases, although “the last seven or so have not\nbeen filed . . . because [Bruce] had had three\nstrikes by the 12th.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 23. See Brief for\nRespondents 40 (stating that Bruce filed three new lawsuits during\nthe pendency of his case before this Court). 3 The Court of Appeals\nconstrued the pleadings in this case as a petition for a writ of\nmandamus. 761 F. 3d, at 3. We assume without deciding that a\nmandamus petition qualifies as a “civil action” or “appeal” for\npurposes of 28 U. S. C. §1915(b). 4 Use of the plural “fees”\nin that paragraph does not persuade us otherwise. Congress has been\nless than meticulous in its employment of the singular “fee” and\nthe plural “fees,” sometimes using those words interchangeably.\nSee, e.g., 28 U. S. C. §1930(a) (“The parties\ncommencing a case under title 11 shall pay to the\nclerk . . . the following filing fees :\n[enumerating several options]. In addition to the filing fee paid to the clerk, [an additional fee shall be paid].” (emphasis\nadded)); 42 U. S. C. §1988(b) (“[T]he\ncourt . . . may allow the prevailing\nparty . . . a reasonable attorney’s fee as\npart of the costs, except that in any action brought against a\njudicial officer . . . such officer shall not be\nheld liable for any costs, including attorney’s fees . . . .” (emphasis added)). See\nalso Dictionary Act, 1 U. S. C. §1 (“In determining the\nmeaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates\notherwise—words importing the singular include and apply to several\npersons, parties, or things; words importing the plural include the\nsingular . . . .”).",
    "textpassage": "The Court held that monthly installment payments for filing fees should be assessed on a per-case basis, requiring simultaneous payments for each case a prisoner has filed. This approach increases the economic burden on prisoners with multiple cases, potentially limiting their ability to access legal recourse due to financial constraints."

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–118 _________________ JESUS C. HERNANDEZ, et al., PETITIONERS v. JESUS MESA, Jr., et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fifth circuit [June 26, 2017] Per Curiam. This case involves a tragic cross-border\nincident in which a United States Border Patrol agent standing on\nUnited States soil shot and killed a Mexican national standing on\nMexican soil. The three questions presented concern whether the\nparents of the victim of that shooting may assert claims for\ndamages against the agent under Bivens v. Six Unknown\nFed. Narcotics Agents , 403 U. S. 388 (1971) ; whether the\nshooting violated the victim’s Fourth Amendment rights; and whether\nthe agent is entitled to qualified immunity on a claim that the\nshooting violated the victim’s Fifth Amendment rights. Because this case was resolved on a motion to\ndismiss, the Court accepts the allegations in the complaint as true\nfor purposes of this opinion. See Wood v. Moss , 572\nU. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12). On June 7, 2010,\nSergio Adrián Hernández Güereca, a 15-year-old Mexican national,\nwas with a group of friends in the cement culvert that separates El\nPaso, Texas, from Ciudad Juarez, Mex-ico. Now all but dry, the\nculvert once contained the watersof the Rio Grande River. The\ninternational boundary runs down the middle of the culvert, and at\nthe top of the embankment on the United States side is a fence.\nAccording to the complaint, Hernández and his friends were playing\na game in which they ran up the embankment on the United States\nside, touched the fence, and then ran back down. At some point,\nBorder Patrol Agent Jesus Mesa, Jr., arrived on the scene by\nbicycle and detained one of Hernández’s friends in United States\nterritory as the friend ran down the embankment. Hernández ran\nacross the international boundary into Mexican territory and stood\nby a pillar that supports a railroad bridge spanning the culvert.\nWhile in United States territory, Mesa then fired at least two\nshots across the border at Hernández. One shot struck Hernández in\nthe face and killed him. According to the complaint, Hernández was\nunarmed and unthreatening at the time. The Department of Justice investigated the\nincident. The Department concluded that the shooting “occurred\nwhile smugglers attempting an illegal border crossing hurled rocks\nfrom close range at a [Customs and Border Patrol] agent who was\nattempting to detain a suspect.” Dept. of Justice, Office of Public\nAffairs, Federal Officials Close Investigation Into the Death of\nSergio Hernandez-Guereca (Apr. 27, 2012), online at\nhttp://www.justice.gov /opa /pr /federal-officials-close-investigation-death-sergio-hernandez-guereca\n(as last visited June 23, 2017). “[O]n these particular facts,” the\nDepartment determined, “the agent did not act inconsistently with\n[Customs and Border Patrol] policy or training regarding use of\nforce.” Ibid. The Department also declined to bring federal\ncivil rights charges against Mesa. In the Department’s view, there\nwas insufficient evidence that Mesa “acted willfully and with the\ndeliberate and specific intent to do something the law forbids,”\nand, in any event, Hernández “was neither within the borders of the\nUnited States nor present on U. S. property, as required for\njurisdiction to exist under the applicable federal civil rights\nstatute.” Ibid. The Department expressed regret for the loss\nof life in the incident and pledged “to work with the Mexican\ngovernment within existing mechanisms and agreements to prevent\nfuture incidents.” Ibid. Petitioners—Hernández’s parents—brought suit.\nAmong other claims, petitioners brought claims against Mesa for\ndamages under Bivens , alleging that Mesa violated\nHernández’s rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. The\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of Texas\ngranted Mesa’s motion to dismiss. A panel of the Court of Appeals\nfor the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. The\npanel held that Hernández lacked any Fourth Amendment rights under\nthe circumstances, but that the shooting violated his Fifth\nAmendment rights. Hernandez v. United States , 757\nF. 3d 249, 267, 272 (2014); id., at 280–281 (Dennis,\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at\n281 (DeMoss, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The\npanel also found “no reason to hesitate in extending Bivens to this new context.” Id., at 275. And the panel held that\nMesa was not entitled to qualified immunity, concluding that “[n]o\nreasonable officer would have understood Agent Mesa’s alleged\nconduct to be lawful.” Id., at 279. Judge DeMoss dissented\nin part, arguing that Hernández lacked any Fifth Amendment rights\nunder the circumstances. Id., at 281–282. On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals\nunanimously affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of\npetitioners’claims against Mesa. The en banc Court of Appeals first\nheld that petitioners had failed to state a claim for a violation\nof the Fourth Amendment because Hernández was “a Mexican citizen\nwho had no ‘significant voluntary connection’ to the United States”\nand “was on Mexican soil at the time he was shot.” Hernandez v. United States , 785 F. 3d 117, 119 (CA5 2015) ( per\ncuriam ) (quoting United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez , 494 U. S. 259, 271 (1990) ). As to\npetitioners’ claim under the Fifth Amendment, the en banc Court of\nAppeals was “somewhat divided on the question of whether Agent\nMesa’s conduct violated the Fifth Amendment,” but was “unanimous”\nin concluding that Mesa was entitled to qualified immunity. 785\nF. 3d, at 120. The en banc Court of Appeals explained that\n“[n]o case law in 2010, when this episode occurred, reasonably\nwarned Agent Mesa” that “the general prohibition of excessive force\napplies where the person injured by a U. S. official standing\non U. S. soil is an alien who had no significant voluntary\nconnection to, and was not in, the United States when the incident\noccurred.” Ibid. Because the en banc Court of Appeals\nresolved petitioners’ claims on other grounds, it “did not consider\nwhether, even if a constitutional claim had been stated, a tort\nremedy should be crafted under Bivens .” Id., at 121,\nn. 1 (Jones, J., concurring). Ten judges filed or joined five\nseparate concurring opinions. Id., at 121–143. This Court granted certiorari. 580 U. S.\n___ (2016). The Court now vacates the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remands for further proceedings. The Court turns first to the Bivens question, which is “antecedent” to the other questions presented. Wood , 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11). In Bivens , this Court “recognized for the first time an implied\nright of action for damages against federal officers alleged to\nhave violated a citizen’s constitutional rights.” Correctional\nServices Corp. v. Malesko , 534 U. S. 61, 66 (2001)\n. A Bivens remedy is not available, however, where there are\n“ ‘special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of\naffirmative action by Congress.’ ” Carlson v. Green , 446 U. S. 14, 18 (1980) (quoting Bivens ,\n403 U. S., at 396). In the decision recently announced in Ziglar v. Abbasi , ante , p. ___, this Courthas\nclarified what constitutes a “special facto[r] counselling\nhesitation.” See ante , at 12–14, 17–23. “[T]he inquiry,” the\nCourt explains, “must concentrate on whether the Judiciary is well\nsuited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and\nweigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to\nproceed.” Ante , at 12. The Court of Appeals here, of course, has not\nhad the opportunity to consider how the reasoning and analysis in Abbasi may bear on this case. And the parties have not had\nthe opportunity to brief and argue its significance. In these\ncircumstances, it is appropriate for the Court of Appeals, rather\nthan this Court, to address the Bivens question in the first\ninstance. This Court, after all, is one “ ‘of review, not of\nfirst view.’ ” Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman , 581 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at\n10) (quoting Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments,\nInc. , 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 14)). With respect to petitioners’ Fourth Amendment\nclaim, the en banc Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to address\nthe Bivens question because it concluded that Hernández\nlacked any Fourth Amendment rights under the circumstances. This\napproach—disposing of a Bivens claim by resolving the\nconstitutional question, while assuming the existence of a Bivens remedy—is appropriate in many cases. This Court has\ntaken that approach on occasion. See, e.g., Wood , supra , at ___ (slip op., at 11). The Fourth Amendment\nquestion in this case, however, is sensitive and may have\nconsequences that are far reaching. It would be imprudent for this\nCourt to resolve that issue when, in light of the intervening\nguidance provided in Abbasi , doing so may be unnecessary to\nresolve this particular case. With respect to petitioners’ Fifth Amendment\nclaim, the en banc Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to address\nthe Bivens question because it held that Mesa was entitled\nto qualified immunity. In reaching that conclusion, the en banc\nCourt of Appeals relied on the fact that Hernández was “an alien\nwho had no significant voluntary connection to . . . the\nUnited States.” 785 F. 3d, at 120. It is undisputed, however,\nthat Hernández’s nationality and the extent of his ties to the\nUnited States were unknown to Mesa at the time of the shooting. The\nen banc Court of Appeals therefore erred in granting qualified\nimmunity based on those facts. “The doctrine of qualified immunity shields\nofficials from civil liability so long as their conduct ‘does not\nviolate clearly established . . . constitutional rights\nof which a reasonable person would have known.’ ” Mullenix v. Luna , 577 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n( per curiam ) (slip op., at 4–5) (quoting Pearson v. Callahan , 555 U. S. 223, 231 (2009) ). The “dispositive\ninquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is\nwhether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct\nwas unlawful in the situation he confronted.” Saucier v. Katz , 533 U. S. 194, 202 (2001) . The qualified\nimmunity analysis thus is limited to “the facts that were knowable\nto the defendant officers” at the time they engaged in the conduct\nin question. White v. Pauly , 580 U. S. ___, ___\n(2017) ( per curiam ) (slip op., at 3). Facts an officer\nlearns after the incident ends—whether those facts would support\ngranting immunity or denying it—are not relevant. Mesa and the Government contend that Mesa is\nentitled to qualified immunity even if Mesa was uncertain about\nHernández’s nationality and his ties to the United States at the\ntime of the shooting. The Government also argues that, in any\nevent, petitioners’ claim is cognizable only under the Fourth\nAmendment, and not under the Fifth Amendment. This Court declines\nto address these arguments in the first instance. The Court of\nAppeals may address them, if necessary, on remand. The facts alleged in the complaint depict a\ndisturbing incident resulting in a heartbreaking loss of life.\nWhether petitioners may recover damages for that loss in this suit\ndepends on questions that are best answered by the Court of Appeals\nin the first instance. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Gorsuch took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of this case.",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus TRINITY LUTHERAN CHURCH OF COLUMBIA, INC. v . COMER, DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL\nRESOURCES certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eighth circuit No. 15–577. Argued April 19, 2017—Decided June\n26, 2017 The Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning\nCenter is a Missouri preschool and daycare center. Originally\nestablished as a nonprofit organization, the Center later merged\nwith Trinity Lutheran Church and now operates under its auspices on\nchurch property. Among the facilities at the Center is a\nplayground, which has a coarse pea gravel surface beneath much of\nthe play equipment. In 2012, the Center sought to replace a large\nportion of the pea gravel with a pour-in-place rubber surface by\nparticipating in Missouri’s Scrap Tire Program. The program, run by\nthe State’s Department of Natural Resources, offers reimbursement\ngrants to qualifying nonprofit organizations that install\nplayground surfaces made from recycled tires. The Department had a\nstrict and express policy of denying grants to any applicant owned\nor controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.\nPursuant to that policy, the Department denied the Center’s\napplication. In a letter rejecting that application, the Department\nexplained that under Article I, Section 7 of the Missouri\nConstitution, the Department could not provide financial assistance\ndirectly to a church. The Department ultimately awarded 14 grants\nas part of the 2012 program. Although the Center ranked fifth out\nof the 44 applicants, it did not receive a grant because it is a\nchurch. Trinity Lutheran sued in Federal District\nCourt, alleging that the Department’s failure to approve its\napplication violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment. The District Court dismissed the suit. The Free Exercise\nClause, the court stated, prohibits the government from outlawing\nor restricting the exercise of a religious practice, but it\ngenerally does not prohibit withholding an affirmative benefit on\naccount of religion. The District Court likened the case before it\nto Locke v. Davey , 540 U. S. 712 , where this\nCourt upheld against a free exercise challenge a State’s decision\nnot to fund degrees in devotional theology as part of a scholarship\nprogram. The District Court held that the Free Exercise Clause did\nnot require the State to make funds available under the Scrap Tire\nProgram to Trinity Lutheran. A divided panel of the Eighth Circuit\naffirmed. The fact that the State could award a scrap tire grant to\nTrinity Lutheran without running afoul of the Establishment Clause\nof the Federal Constitution, the court ruled, did not mean that the\nFree Exercise Clause compelled the State to disregard the broader\nantiestablishment principle reflected in its own Constitution. Held : The Department’s policy\nviolated the rights of Trinity Lutheran under the Free Exercise\nClause of the First Amendment by denying the Church an otherwise\navailable public benefit on account of its religious status.\nPp. 6–15. (a) This Court has repeatedly confirmed\nthat denying a generally available benefit solely on account of\nreligious identity imposes a penalty on the free exercise of\nreligion. Thus, in McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U. S.\n618 , the Court struck down a Tennessee statute disqualifying\nministers from serving as delegates to the State’s constitutional\nconvention. A plurality recognized that such a law discriminated\nagainst McDaniel by denying him a benefit solely because of his\n“ status as a ‘minister.’ ” Id., at 627. In\nrecent years, when rejecting free exercise challenges to neutral\nlaws of general applicability, the Court has been careful to\ndistinguish such laws from those that single out the religious for\ndisfavored treatment. See, e.g. , Lyng v. Northwest\nIndian Cemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U. S. 439 ; Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith , 494 U. S. 872 ; and Church of Lukumi Babalu\nAye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U. S. 520 . It has\nremained a fundamental principle of this Court’s free exercise\njurisprudence that laws imposing “special disabilities on the basis\nof . . . religious status” trigger the strictest\nscrutiny. Id. , at 533. Pp. 6–9. (b) The Department’s policy expressly\ndiscriminates against otherwise eligible recipients by\ndisqualifying them from a public benefit solely because of their\nreligious character. Like the disqualification statute in McDaniel , the Department’s policy puts Trinity Lutheran to a\nchoice: It may participate in an otherwise available benefit\nprogram or remain a religious institution. When the State\nconditions a benefit in this way, McDaniel says plainly that\nthe State has imposed a penalty on the free exercise of religion\nthat must withstand the most exacting scrutiny. 435 U. S., at\n626, 628. The Department contends that simply declining\nto allocate to Trinity Lutheran a subsidy the State had no\nobligation to provide does not meaningfully burden the Church’s\nfree exercise rights. Absent any such burden, the argument\ncontinues, the Department is free to follow the State’s\nantiestablishment objection to providing funds directly to a\nchurch. But, as even the Department acknowledges, the Free Exercise\nClause protects against “indirect coercion or penalties on the free\nexercise of religion, not just outright prohibitions.” Lyng ,\n485 U. S., at 450. Trinity Lutheran is not claiming any\nentitlement to a subsidy. It is asserting a right to participate in\na government benefit program without having to disavow its\nreligious character. The express discrimination against religious\nexercise here is not the denial of a grant, but rather the refusal\nto allow the Church—solely because it is a church—to compete with\nsecular organizations for a grant. Pp. 9–11. (c) The Department tries to sidestep this\nCourt’s precedents by arguing that this case is instead controlled\nby Locke v. Davey. It is not. In Locke , the\nState of Washington created a scholarship program to assist\nhigh-achieving students with the costs of postsecondary education.\nScholarship recipients were free to use state funds at accredited\nreligious and non-religious schools alike, but they could not use\nthe funds to pursue a devotional theology degree. At the outset,\nthe Court made clear that Locke was not like the cases in\nwhich the Court struck down laws requiring individuals to “choose\nbetween their religious beliefs and receiving a government\nbenefit.” 540 U. S., at 720–721. Davey was not denied a\nscholarship because of who he was ; he was denied a\nscholarship because of what he proposed to do . Here there is\nno question that Trinity Lutheran was denied a grant simply because\nof what it is—a church. The Court in Locke also stated that\nWashington’s restriction on the use of its funds was in keeping\nwith the State’s antiestablishment interest in not using taxpayer\nfunds to pay for the training of clergy, an “essentially religious\nendeavor,” id. , at 721. Here, nothing of the sort can be\nsaid about a program to use recycled tires to resurface\nplaygrounds. At any rate, the Court took account of Washington’s\nantiestablishment interest only after determining that the\nscholarship program did not “require students to choose between\ntheir religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit.” Id. , at 720–721. There is no dispute that Trinity Lutheran is put to the choice between being a church and receiving a\ngovernment benefit. Pp. 11–14. (d) The Department’s discriminatory\npolicy does not survive the “most rigorous” scrutiny that this\nCourt applies to laws imposing special disabilities on account of\nreligious status. Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546. That\nstandard demands a state interest “of the highest order” to justify\nthe policy at issue. McDaniel , 435 U. S., at 628\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Yet the Department offers\nnothing more than Missouri’s preference for skating as far as\npossible from religious establishment concerns. In the face of the\nclear infringement on free exercise before the Court, that interest\ncannot qualify as compelling. Pp. 14–15. 788 F. 3d 779, reversed and remanded. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, except as to footnote 3. Kennedy, Alito, and Kagan, JJ.,\njoined that opinion in full, and Thomas and Gorsuch, JJ., joined\nexcept as to footnote 3.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–577 _________________ TRINITY LUTHERAN CHURCH OF COLUMBIA, INC.,\nPETITIONER v. CAROL S. COMER, DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT\nOF NATURALRESOURCES on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eighth circuit [June 26, 2017] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, except as to footnote 3. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources\noffers state grants to help public and private schools, nonprofit\ndaycare centers, and other nonprofit entities purchase rubber\nplayground surfaces made from recycled tires. Trinity Lutheran\nChurch applied for such a grant for its preschool and daycare\ncenter and would have received one, but for the fact that Trinity\nLutheran is a church. The Department had a policy of categorically\ndisqualifying churches and other religious organizations from\nreceiving grants under its playground resurfacing program. The\nquestion presented is whether the Department’s policy violated the\nrights of Trinity Lutheran under the Free Exercise Clause of the\nFirst Amendment. I A The Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning\nCenter is a preschool and daycare center open throughout the year\nto serve working families in Boone County, Missouri, and the\nsurrounding area. Established as a nonprofit organization in 1980,\nthe Center merged with Trinity Lutheran Church in 1985 and operates\nunder its auspices on church property. The Center admits students\nof any religion, and enrollment stands at about 90 children ranging\nfrom age two to five. The Center includes a playground that is\nequipped with the basic playground essentials: slides, swings,\njungle gyms, monkey bars, and sandboxes. Almost the entire surface\nbeneath and surrounding the play equipment is coarse pea gravel.\nYoungsters, of course, often fall on the playground or tumble from\nthe equipment. And when they do, the gravel can be unforgiving. In 2012, the Center sought to replace a large\nportion of the pea gravel with a pour-in-place rubber surface by\nparticipating in Missouri’s Scrap Tire Program. Run by the State’s\nDepartment of Natural Resources to reduce the number of used tires\ndestined for landfills and dump sites, the program offers\nreimbursement grants to qualifying nonprofit organizations that\npurchase playground surfaces made from recycled tires. It is funded\nthrough a fee imposed on the sale of new tires in the State. Due to limited resources, the Department cannot\noffer grants to all applicants and so awards them on a competitive\nbasis to those scoring highest based on several criteria, such as\nthe poverty level of the population in the surrounding area and the\napplicant’s plan to promote recycling. When the Center applied, the\nDepartment had a strict and express policy of denying grants to any\napplicant owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious\nentity. That policy, in the Department’s view, was compelled by\nArticle I, Section 7 of the Missouri Constitution, which\nprovides: “That no money shall ever be taken from\nthe public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church,\nsect or denomination of religion, or in aid of any priest,\npreacher, minister or teacher thereof, as such; and that no\npreference shall be given to nor any discrimination made against\nany church, sect or creed of religion, or any form of religious\nfaith or worship.” In its application, the Center disclosed its\nstatus as a ministry of Trinity Lutheran Church and specified that\nthe Center’s mission was “to provide a safe, clean, and attractive\nschool facility in conjunction with an educational program\nstructured to allow a child to grow spiritually, physically,\nsocially, and cognitively.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 131a. After\ndescribing the playground and the safety hazards posed by its\ncurrent surface, the Center detailed the anticipated benefits of\nthe proposed project: increasing access to the playground for all\nchildren, including those with disabilities, by providing a surface\ncompliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\nproviding a safe, long-lasting, and resilient surface under the\nplay areas; and improving Missouri’s environment by putting\nrecycled tires to positive use. The Center also noted that the\nbenefits of a new surface would extend beyond its students to the\nlocal community, whose children often use the playground during\nnon-school hours. The Center ranked fifth among the 44 applicants\nin the 2012 Scrap Tire Program. But despite its high score, the\nCenter was deemed categorically ineligible to receive a grant. In a\nletter rejecting the Center’s application, the program director\nexplained that, under Article I, Section 7 of the Missouri\nConstitution, the Department could not provide financial assistance\ndirectly to a church. The Department ultimately awarded 14 grants as\npart of the 2012 program. Because the Center was operated by\nTrinity Lutheran Church, it did not receive a grant. B Trinity Lutheran sued the Director of the\nDepartment in Federal District Court. The Church alleged that the\nDepartment’s failure to approve the Center’s application, pursuant\nto its policy of denying grants to religiously affiliated\napplicants, violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment. Trinity Lutheran sought declara-tory and injunctive\nrelief prohibiting the Department from discriminating against the\nChurch on that basis in future grant applications. The District Court granted the Department’s\nmotion to dismiss. The Free Exercise Clause, the District Court\nstated, prohibits the government from outlawing or restricting the\nexercise of a religious practice; it generally does not prohibit\nwithholding an affirmative benefit on account of religion. The\nDistrict Court likened the Department’s denial of the scrap tire\ngrant to the situation this Court encountered in Locke v. Davey , 540 U. S. 712 (2004) . In that case, we upheld\nagainst a free exercise challenge the State of Washington’s\ndecision not to fund degrees in devotional theology as part of a\nstate scholarship program. Finding the present case “nearly\nindistinguishable from Locke ,” the District Court held that\nthe Free Exercise Clause did not require the State to make funds\navailable under the Scrap Tire Program to religious institutions\nlike Trinity Lutheran. Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia,\nInc. v. Pauley , 976 F. Supp. 2d 1137, 1151 (WD Mo.\n2013). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\naffirmed. The court recognized that it was “rather clear” that\nMissouri could award a scrap tire grant to Trinity Lutheran\nwithout running afoul of the Establishment Clause of the United\nStates Constitution. Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia,\nInc. v. Pauley , 788 F. 3d 779, 784 (2015). But, the\nCourt of Appeals explained, that did not mean the Free Exercise\nClause compelled the State to disregard the antiestablishment\nprinciple reflected in its own Constitution. Viewing a monetary\ngrant to a religious institution as a “ ‘hallmark[ ] of\nan established religion,’ ” the court concluded that the State\ncould rely on an applicant’s religious status to deny its\napplication. Id. , at 785 (quoting Locke , 540\nU. S., at 722; some internal quotation marks omitted). Judge Gruender dissented. He distinguished Locke on the ground that it concerned the narrow issue of\nfunding for the religious training of clergy, and “did not leave\nstates with unfettered discretion to exclude the religious from\ngenerally available public benefits.” 788 F. 3d, at 791\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Rehearing en banc was denied by an equally\ndivided court. We granted certiorari sub nom. Trinity\nLutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Pauley , 577\nU. S. ___ (2016), and now reverse.[ 1 ] II The First Amendment provides, in part, that\n“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of\nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” The parties\nagree that the Establishment Clause of that Amendment does not\nprevent Missouri from including Trinity Lutheran in the Scrap Tire\nProgram. That does not, however, answer the question under the Free\nExercise Clause, because we have recognized that there is “play in\nthe joints” between what the Establishment Clause permits and the\nFree Exercise Clause compels. Locke , 540 U. S., at 718\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Free Exercise Clause “protect[s] religious\nobservers against unequal treatment” and subjects to the strictest\nscrutiny laws that target the religious for “special disabilities”\nbased on their “religious status.” Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,\nInc. v. Hialeah , 508 U. S. 520, 533, 542 (1993)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Applying that basic principle,\nthis Court has repeatedly confirmed that denying a generally\navailable benefit solely on account of religious identity imposes a\npenalty on the free exercise of religion that can be justified only\nby a state interest “of the highest order.” McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U. S. 618, 628 (1978) (plurality opinion)\n(quoting Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U. S. 205, 215\n(1972) ). In Everson v. Board of\nEducation of Ewing , 330 U. S. 1 (1947) , for example, we\nupheld against an Establishment Clause challenge a New Jersey law\nenabling a local school district to reimburse parents for the\npublic transportation costs of sending their children to public and\nprivate schools, including parochial schools. In the course of\nruling that the Establishment Clause allowed New Jersey to extend\nthat public benefit to all its citizens regardless of their\nreligious belief, we explained that a State “cannot hamper its\ncitizens in the free exercise of their own religion. Consequently,\nit cannot exclude individual Catholics, Lutherans, Mohammedans,\nBaptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers, Presbyterians, or the\nmembers of any other faith, because of their faith, or lack of\nit , from receiving the benefits of public welfare legislation.” Id. , at 16. Three decades later, in McDaniel v. Paty , the Court struck down under the Free Exercise Clause a\nTennessee statute disqualifying ministers from serving as delegates\nto the State’s constitutional convention. Writing for the\nplurality, Chief Justice Burger acknowledged that Tennessee had\ndisqualified ministers from serving as legislators since the\nadoption of its first Constitution in 1796, and that a number of\nearly States had also disqualified ministers from legislative\noffice. This historical tradition, however, did not change the fact\nthat the statute discriminated against McDaniel by denying him a\nbenefit solely because of his “ status as a\n‘minister.’ ” 435 U. S., at 627. McDaniel could not seek\nto participate in the convention while also maintaining his role as\na minister; to pursue the one, he would have to give up the other.\nIn this way, said Chief Justice Burger, the Tennessee law\n“effectively penalizes the free exercise of [McDaniel’s]\nconstitutional liberties.” Id. , at 626 (quoting Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U. S. 398, 406 (1963) ;\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Joined by Justice Marshall in\nconcurrence, Justice Brennan added that “because the challenged\nprovision requires [McDaniel] to purchase his right to engage in\nthe ministry by sacrificing his candidacy it impairs the free\nexercise of his religion.” McDaniel , 435 U. S., at\n634. In recent years, when this Court has rejected\nfree exercise challenges, the laws in question have been neutral\nand generally applicable without regard to religion. We have been\ncareful to distinguish such laws from those that single out the\nreligious for disfavored treatment. For example, in Lyng v. Northwest\nIndian Cemetery Protective Association , 485 U. S. 439\n(1988) , we held that the Free Exercise Clause did not prohibit the\nGovernment from timber harvesting or road construction on a\nparticular tract of federal land, even though the Government’s\naction would obstruct the religious practice of several Native\nAmerican Tribes that held certain sites on the tract to be sacred.\nAccepting that “[t]he building of a road or the harvesting of\ntimber . . . would interfere significantly with private\npersons’ ability to pursue spiritual fulfillment according to their\nown religious beliefs,” we nonetheless found no free exercise\nviolation, because the affected individuals were not being “coerced\nby the Government’s action into violating their religious beliefs.” Id., at 449. The Court specifically noted, however, that the\nGovernment action did not “penalize religious activity by denying\nany person an equal share of the rights, benefits, and privileges\nenjoyed by other citizens.” Ibid. In Employment Division, Department of Human\nResources of Oregon v. Smith , 494 U. S. 872 (1990)\n, we rejected a free exercise claim brought by two members of a\nNative American church denied unemployment benefits because they\nhad violated Oregon’s drug laws by ingesting peyote for sacramental\npurposes. Along the same lines as our decision in Lyng , we\nheld that the Free Exercise Clause did not entitle the church\nmembers to a special dispensation from the general criminal laws on\naccount of their religion. At the same time, we again made clear\nthat the Free Exercise Clause did guard against the\ngovernment’s imposition of “special disabilities on the basis of\nreligious views or religious status.” 494 U. S., at 877\n(citing McDaniel , 435 U. S. 618 ).[ 2 ] Finally, in Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,\nInc. v. Hia-leah , we struck down three facially neutral\ncity ordinances that outlawed certain forms of animal slaughter.\nMembers of the Santeria religion challenged the ordinances under\nthe Free Exercise Clause, alleging that despite their facial\nneutrality, the ordinances had a discriminatory purpose easy to\nferret out: prohibiting sacrificial rituals integral to Santeria\nbut distasteful to local residents. We agreed. Before explaining\nwhy the challenged ordinances were not, in fact, neutral or\ngenerally applicable, the Court recounted the fundamentals of our\nfree exercise jurisprudence. A law, we said, may not discriminate\nagainst “some or all religious beliefs.” 508 U. S., at 532.\nNor may a law regulate or outlaw conduct because it is religiously\nmotivated. And, citing McDaniel and Smith , we\nrestated the now-familiar refrain: The Free Exercise Clause\nprotects against laws that “ ‘impose[ ] special\ndis-abilities on the basis of . . . religious\nstatus.’ ” 508 U. S., at 533 (quoting Smith , 494\nU. S., at 877); see also Mitchell v. Helms , 530\nU. S. 793, 828 (2000) (plurality opinion) (noting “our\ndecisions that have prohibited governments from discriminating in\nthe distribution of public benefits based upon religious status or\nsincerity” (citing Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of\nUniv. of Va. , 515 U. S. 819 (1995) ; Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist. , 508 U. S.\n384 (1993) ; Widmar v. Vincent , 454 U. S. 263\n(1981) )). III A The Department’s policy expressly\ndiscriminates against otherwise eligible recipients by\ndisqualifying them from a public benefit solely because of their\nreligious character. If the cases just described make one thing\nclear, it is that such a policy imposes a penalty on the free\nexercise of religion that triggers the most exacting scrutiny. Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546. This conclusion is\nunremarkable in light of our prior decisions. Like the disqualification statute in McDaniel , the Department’s policy puts Trinity Lutheran to a\nchoice: It may participate in an otherwise available benefit\nprogram or remain a religious institution. Of course, Trinity\nLu-theran is free to continue operating as a church, just as\nMcDaniel was free to continue being a minister. But that freedom\ncomes at the cost of automatic and absolute exclusion from the\nbenefits of a public program for which the Center is otherwise\nfully qualified. And when the State conditions a benefit in this\nway, McDaniel says plainly that the State has punished the\nfree exercise of religion: “To condition the availability of\nbenefits . . . upon [a recipient’s] willingness to\n. . . surrender[ ] his religiously impelled [status]\neffectively penalizes the free exercise of his constitutional\nliberties.” 435 U. S., at 626 (plurality opinion) (alterations\nomitted). The Department contends that merely declining to\nextend funds to Trinity Lutheran does not prohibit the\nChurch from engaging in any religious conduct or otherwise\nexercising its religious rights. In this sense, says the\nDepartment, its policy is unlike the ordinances struck down in Lukumi , which outlawed rituals central to Santeria. Here the\nDepartment has simply declined to allocate to Trinity Lutheran a\nsubsidy the State had no obligation to provide in the first place.\nThat decision does not meaningfully burden the Church’s free\nexercise rights. And absent any such burden, the argument\ncontinues, the Department is free to heed the State’s\nantiestablishment objection to providing funds directly to a\nchurch. Brief for Respondent 7–12, 14–16. It is true the Department has not criminalized\nthe way Trinity Lutheran worships or told the Church that it cannot\nsubscribe to a certain view of the Gospel. But, as the Department\nitself acknowledges, the Free Exercise Clause protects against\n“indirect coercion or penalties on the free exercise of religion,\nnot just outright prohibitions.” Lyng , 485 U. S., at\n450. As the Court put it more than 50 years ago, “[i]t is too late\nin the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression\nmay be infringed by the denial of or placing of conditions upon a\nbenefit or privilege.” Sherbert , 374 U. S., at 404; see\nalso McDaniel , 435 U. S., at 633 (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (The “proposition—that the law does not\ninterfere with free exercise because it does not directly prohibit\nreligious activity, but merely conditions eligibility for office on\nits abandonment—is . . . squarely rejected by\nprecedent”). Trinity Lutheran is not claiming any entitlement\nto a subsidy. It instead asserts a right to participate in a\ngovernment benefit program without having to disavow its religious\ncharacter. The “imposition of such a condition upon even a\ngratuitous benefit inevitably deter[s] or discourage[s] the\nexercise of First Amendment rights.” Sherbert , 374\nU. S., at 405. The express discrimination against religious\nexercise here is not the denial of a grant, but rather the refusal\nto allow the Church—solely because it is a church—to compete with\nsecular organizations for a grant. Cf. Northeastern Fla.\nChapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville , 508 U. S. 656, 666 (1993) (“[T]he ‘injury\nin fact’ is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the\nbidding process, not the loss of a contract”). Trinity Lutheran is\na member of the community too, and the State’s decision to exclude\nit for purposes of this public program must withstand the strictest\nscrutiny. B The Department attempts to get out from under\nthe weight of our precedents by arguing that the free exercise\nquestion in this case is instead controlled by our decision in Locke v. Davey . It is not. In Locke , the State\nof Washington created a scholarship program to assist\nhigh-achieving students with the costs of postsecondary education.\nThe scholarships were paid out of the State’s general fund, and\neligibility was based on criteria such as an applicant’s score on\ncollege admission tests and family income. While scholarship\nrecipients were free to use the money at accredited religious and\nnon-religious schools alike, they were not permitted to use the\nfunds to pursue a devotional theology degree—one “devotional in\nnature or designed to induce religious faith.” 540 U. S., at\n716 (internal quotation marks omitted). Davey was selected for a\nscholarship but was denied the funds when he refused to certify\nthat he would not use them toward a devotional degree. He sued,\narguing that the State’s refusal to allow its scholarship money to\ngo toward such degrees violated his free exercise rights. This Court disagreed. It began by explaining\nwhat was not at issue. Washington’s selective funding\nprogram was not comparable to the free exercise violations found in\nthe “ Lukumi line of cases,” including those striking down\nlaws requiring individuals to “choose between their religious\nbeliefs and receiving a government benefit.” Id. , at\n720–721. At the outset, then, the Court made clear that Locke was not like the case now before us. Washington’s restriction on the use of its\nscholarship funds was different. According to the Court, the State\nhad “merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction.” Id. , at 721. Davey was not denied a scholarship because of\nwho he was ; he was denied a scholarship because of what he\nproposed to do —use the funds to prepare for the ministry.\nHere there is no question that Trinity Lutheran was denied a grant\nsimply because of what it is—a church. The Court in Locke also stated that\nWashington’s choice was in keeping with the State’s\nantiestablishment interest in not using taxpayer funds to pay for\nthe training of clergy; in fact, the Court could “think of few\nareas in which a State’s antiestablishment interests come more into\nplay.” Id., at 722. The claimant in Locke sought\nfunding for an “essentially religious endeavor . . . akin\nto a religious calling as well as an academic pursuit,” and\nopposition to such funding “to support church leaders” lay at the\nhistoric core of the Religion Clauses. Id. , at 721–722. Here\nnothing of the sort can be said about a program to use recycled\ntires to resurface playgrounds. Relying on Locke , the Department\nnonetheless emphasizes Missouri’s similar constitutional tradition\nof not furnishing taxpayer money directly to churches. Brief for\nRespondent 15–16. But Locke took account of Washington’s\nantiestablishment interest only after determining, as noted, that\nthe scholarship program did not “require students to choose between\ntheir religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit.” 540\nU. S., at 720–721 (citing McDaniel , 435 U. S. 618\n). As the Court put it, Washington’s scholarship program went “a\nlong way toward including religion in its benefits.” Locke ,\n540 U. S., at 724. Students in the program were free to use\ntheir scholarships at “pervasively religious schools.” Ibid .\nDavey could use his scholarship to pursue a secular degree at one\ninstitution while studying devotional theology at another. Id., at 721, n. 4. He could also use his scholarship\nmoney to attend a religious college and take devotional theology\ncourses there. Id., at 725. The only thing he could not do\nwas use the scholarship to pursue a degree in that subject. In this case, there is no dispute that Trinity\nLutheran is put to the choice between being a church and\nreceiving a government benefit. The rule is simple: No churches\nneed apply.[ 3 ] C The State in this case expressly requires\nTrinity Lutheran to renounce its religious character in order to\nparticipate in an otherwise generally available public benefit\nprogram, for which it is fully qualified. Our cases make clear that\nsuch a condition imposes a penalty on the free exercise of religion\nthat must be subjected to the “most rigorous” scrutiny. Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546.[ 4 ] Under that stringent standard, only a state\ninterest “of the highest order” can justify the Department’s\ndiscriminatory policy. McDaniel , 435 U. S., at 628\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Yet the Department offers\nnothing more than Missouri’s policy preference for skating as far\nas possible from religious establishment concerns. Brief for\nRespondent 15–16. In the face of the clear infringement on free\nexercise before us, that interest cannot qual-ify as compelling. As\nwe said when considering Missouri’s same policy preference on a\nprior occasion, “",

COMER, DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL\nRESOURCES certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eighth circuit No. 15–577. Argued April 19, 2017—Decided June\n26, 2017 The Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning\nCenter is a Missouri preschool and daycare center. Originally\nestablished as a nonprofit organization, the Center later merged\nwith Trinity Lutheran Church and now operates under its auspices on\nchurch property. Among the facilities at the Center is a\nplayground, which has a coarse pea gravel surface beneath much of\nthe play equipment. In 2012, the Center sought to replace a large\nportion of the pea gravel with a pour-in-place rubber surface by\nparticipating in Missouri’s Scrap Tire Program. The program, run by\nthe State’s Department of Natural Resources, offers reimbursement\ngrants to qualifying nonprofit organizations that install\nplayground surfaces made from recycled tires. The Department had a\nstrict and express policy of denying grants to any applicant owned\nor controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.\nPursuant to that policy, the Department denied the Center’s\napplication. In a letter rejecting that application, the Department\nexplained that under Article I, Section 7 of the Missouri\nConstitution, the Department could not provide financial assistance\ndirectly to a church. The Department ultimately awarded 14 grants\nas part of the 2012 program. Although the Center ranked fifth out\nof the 44 applicants, it did not receive a grant because it is a\nchurch. Trinity Lutheran sued in Federal District\nCourt, alleging that the Department’s failure to approve its\napplication violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment. The District Court dismissed the suit. The Free Exercise\nClause, the court stated, prohibits the government from outlawing\nor restricting the exercise of a religious practice, but it\ngenerally does not prohibit withholding an affirmative benefit on\naccount of religion. The District Court likened the case before it\nto Locke v. Davey , 540 U. S. 712 , where this\nCourt upheld against a free exercise challenge a State’s decision\nnot to fund degrees in devotional theology as part of a scholarship\nprogram. The District Court held that the Free Exercise Clause did\nnot require the State to make funds available under the Scrap Tire\nProgram to Trinity Lutheran. A divided panel of the Eighth Circuit\naffirmed. The fact that the State could award a scrap tire grant to\nTrinity Lutheran without running afoul of the Establishment Clause\nof the Federal Constitution, the court ruled, did not mean that the\nFree Exercise Clause compelled the State to disregard the broader\nantiestablishment principle reflected in its own Constitution. Held : The Department’s policy\nviolated the rights of Trinity Lutheran under the Free Exercise\nClause of the First Amendment by denying the Church an otherwise\navailable public benefit on account of its religious status.\nPp. 6–15. (a) This Court has repeatedly confirmed\nthat denying a generally available benefit solely on account of\nreligious identity imposes a penalty on the free exercise of\nreligion. Thus, in McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U. S.\n618 , the Court struck down a Tennessee statute disqualifying\nministers from serving as delegates to the State’s constitutional\nconvention. A plurality recognized that such a law discriminated\nagainst McDaniel by denying him a benefit solely because of his\n“ status as a ‘minister.’ ” Id., at 627. In\nrecent years, when rejecting free exercise challenges to neutral\nlaws of general applicability, the Court has been careful to\ndistinguish such laws from those that single out the religious for\ndisfavored treatment. See, e.g. , Lyng v. Northwest\nIndian Cemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U. S. 439 ; Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith , 494 U. S. 872 ; and Church of Lukumi Babalu\nAye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U. S. 520 . It has\nremained a fundamental principle of this Court’s free exercise\njurisprudence that laws imposing “special disabilities on the basis\nof . . . religious status” trigger the strictest\nscrutiny. Id. , at 533. Pp. 6–9. (b) The Department’s policy expressly\ndiscriminates against otherwise eligible recipients by\ndisqualifying them from a public benefit solely because of their\nreligious character. Like the disqualification statute in McDaniel , the Department’s policy puts Trinity Lutheran to a\nchoice: It may participate in an otherwise available benefit\nprogram or remain a religious institution. When the State\nconditions a benefit in this way, McDaniel says plainly that\nthe State has imposed a penalty on the free exercise of religion\nthat must withstand the most exacting scrutiny. 435 U. S., at\n626, 628. The Department contends that simply declining\nto allocate to Trinity Lutheran a subsidy the State had no\nobligation to provide does not meaningfully burden the Church’s\nfree exercise rights. Absent any such burden, the argument\ncontinues, the Department is free to follow the State’s\nantiestablishment objection to providing funds directly to a\nchurch. But, as even the Department acknowledges, the Free Exercise\nClause protects against “indirect coercion or penalties on the free\nexercise of religion, not just outright prohibitions.” Lyng ,\n485 U. S., at 450. Trinity Lutheran is not claiming any\nentitlement to a subsidy. It is asserting a right to participate in\na government benefit program without having to disavow its\nreligious character. The express discrimination against religious\nexercise here is not the denial of a grant, but rather the refusal\nto allow the Church—solely because it is a church—to compete with\nsecular organizations for a grant. Pp. 9–11. (c) The Department tries to sidestep this\nCourt’s precedents by arguing that this case is instead controlled\nby Locke v. Davey. It is not. In Locke , the\nState of Washington created a scholarship program to assist\nhigh-achieving students with the costs of postsecondary education.\nScholarship recipients were free to use state funds at accredited\nreligious and non-religious schools alike, but they could not use\nthe funds to pursue a devotional theology degree. At the outset,\nthe Court made clear that Locke was not like the cases in\nwhich the Court struck down laws requiring individuals to “choose\nbetween their religious beliefs and receiving a government\nbenefit.” 540 U. S., at 720–721. Davey was not denied a\nscholarship because of who he was ; he was denied a\nscholarship because of what he proposed to do . Here there is\nno question that Trinity Lutheran was denied a grant simply because\nof what it is—a church. The Court in Locke also stated that\nWashington’s restriction on the use of its funds was in keeping\nwith the State’s antiestablishment interest in not using taxpayer\nfunds to pay for the training of clergy, an “essentially religious\nendeavor,” id. , at 721. Here, nothing of the sort can be\nsaid about a program to use recycled tires to resurface\nplaygrounds. At any rate, the Court took account of Washington’s\nantiestablishment interest only after determining that the\nscholarship program did not “require students to choose between\ntheir religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit.” Id. , at 720–721. There is no dispute that Trinity Lutheran is put to the choice between being a church and receiving a\ngovernment benefit. Pp. 11–14. (d) The Department’s discriminatory\npolicy does not survive the “most rigorous” scrutiny that this\nCourt applies to laws imposing special disabilities on account of\nreligious status. Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546. That\nstandard demands a state interest “of the highest order” to justify\nthe policy at issue. McDaniel , 435 U. S., at 628\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Yet the Department offers\nnothing more than Missouri’s preference for skating as far as\npossible from religious establishment concerns. In the face of the\nclear infringement on free exercise before the Court, that interest\ncannot qualify as compelling. Pp. 14–15. 788 F. 3d 779, reversed and remanded. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, except as to footnote 3. Kennedy, Alito, and Kagan, JJ.,\njoined that opinion in full, and Thomas and Gorsuch, JJ., joined\nexcept as to footnote 3.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–577 _________________ TRINITY LUTHERAN CHURCH OF COLUMBIA, INC.,\nPETITIONER v. CAROL S. COMER, DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT\nOF NATURALRESOURCES on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eighth circuit [June 26, 2017] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, except as to footnote 3. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources\noffers state grants to help public and private schools, nonprofit\ndaycare centers, and other nonprofit entities purchase rubber\nplayground surfaces made from recycled tires. Trinity Lutheran\nChurch applied for such a grant for its preschool and daycare\ncenter and would have received one, but for the fact that Trinity\nLutheran is a church. The Department had a policy of categorically\ndisqualifying churches and other religious organizations from\nreceiving grants under its playground resurfacing program. The\nquestion presented is whether the Department’s policy violated the\nrights of Trinity Lutheran under the Free Exercise Clause of the\nFirst Amendment. I A The Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning\nCenter is a preschool and daycare center open throughout the year\nto serve working families in Boone County, Missouri, and the\nsurrounding area. Established as a nonprofit organization in 1980,\nthe Center merged with Trinity Lutheran Church in 1985 and operates\nunder its auspices on church property. The Center admits students\nof any religion, and enrollment stands at about 90 children ranging\nfrom age two to five. The Center includes a playground that is\nequipped with the basic playground essentials: slides, swings,\njungle gyms, monkey bars, and sandboxes. Almost the entire surface\nbeneath and surrounding the play equipment is coarse pea gravel.\nYoungsters, of course, often fall on the playground or tumble from\nthe equipment. And when they do, the gravel can be unforgiving. In 2012, the Center sought to replace a large\nportion of the pea gravel with a pour-in-place rubber surface by\nparticipating in Missouri’s Scrap Tire Program. Run by the State’s\nDepartment of Natural Resources to reduce the number of used tires\ndestined for landfills and dump sites, the program offers\nreimbursement grants to qualifying nonprofit organizations that\npurchase playground surfaces made from recycled tires. It is funded\nthrough a fee imposed on the sale of new tires in the State. Due to limited resources, the Department cannot\noffer grants to all applicants and so awards them on a competitive\nbasis to those scoring highest based on several criteria, such as\nthe poverty level of the population in the surrounding area and the\napplicant’s plan to promote recycling. When the Center applied, the\nDepartment had a strict and express policy of denying grants to any\napplicant owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious\nentity. That policy, in the Department’s view, was compelled by\nArticle I, Section 7 of the Missouri Constitution, which\nprovides: “That no money shall ever be taken from\nthe public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church,\nsect or denomination of religion, or in aid of any priest,\npreacher, minister or teacher thereof, as such; and that no\npreference shall be given to nor any discrimination made against\nany church, sect or creed of religion, or any form of religious\nfaith or worship.” In its application, the Center disclosed its\nstatus as a ministry of Trinity Lutheran Church and specified that\nthe Center’s mission was “to provide a safe, clean, and attractive\nschool facility in conjunction with an educational program\nstructured to allow a child to grow spiritually, physically,\nsocially, and cognitively.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 131a. After\ndescribing the playground and the safety hazards posed by its\ncurrent surface, the Center detailed the anticipated benefits of\nthe proposed project: increasing access to the playground for all\nchildren, including those with disabilities, by providing a surface\ncompliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\nproviding a safe, long-lasting, and resilient surface under the\nplay areas; and improving Missouri’s environment by putting\nrecycled tires to positive use. The Center also noted that the\nbenefits of a new surface would extend beyond its students to the\nlocal community, whose children often use the playground during\nnon-school hours. The Center ranked fifth among the 44 applicants\nin the 2012 Scrap Tire Program. But despite its high score, the\nCenter was deemed categorically ineligible to receive a grant. In a\nletter rejecting the Center’s application, the program director\nexplained that, under Article I, Section 7 of the Missouri\nConstitution, the Department could not provide financial assistance\ndirectly to a church. The Department ultimately awarded 14 grants as\npart of the 2012 program. Because the Center was operated by\nTrinity Lutheran Church, it did not receive a grant. B Trinity Lutheran sued the Director of the\nDepartment in Federal District Court. The Church alleged that the\nDepartment’s failure to approve the Center’s application, pursuant\nto its policy of denying grants to religiously affiliated\napplicants, violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment. Trinity Lutheran sought declara-tory and injunctive\nrelief prohibiting the Department from discriminating against the\nChurch on that basis in future grant applications. The District Court granted the Department’s\nmotion to dismiss. The Free Exercise Clause, the District Court\nstated, prohibits the government from outlawing or restricting the\nexercise of a religious practice; it generally does not prohibit\nwithholding an affirmative benefit on account of religion. The\nDistrict Court likened the Department’s denial of the scrap tire\ngrant to the situation this Court encountered in Locke v. Davey , 540 U. S. 712 (2004) . In that case, we upheld\nagainst a free exercise challenge the State of Washington’s\ndecision not to fund degrees in devotional theology as part of a\nstate scholarship program. Finding the present case “nearly\nindistinguishable from Locke ,” the District Court held that\nthe Free Exercise Clause did not require the State to make funds\navailable under the Scrap Tire Program to religious institutions\nlike Trinity Lutheran. Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia,\nInc. v. Pauley , 976 F. Supp. 2d 1137, 1151 (WD Mo.\n2013). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\naffirmed. The court recognized that it was “rather clear” that\nMissouri could award a scrap tire grant to Trinity Lutheran\nwithout running afoul of the Establishment Clause of the United\nStates Constitution. Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia,\nInc. v. Pauley , 788 F. 3d 779, 784 (2015). But, the\nCourt of Appeals explained, that did not mean the Free Exercise\nClause compelled the State to disregard the antiestablishment\nprinciple reflected in its own Constitution. Viewing a monetary\ngrant to a religious institution as a “ ‘hallmark[ ] of\nan established religion,’ ” the court concluded that the State\ncould rely on an applicant’s religious status to deny its\napplication. Id. , at 785 (quoting Locke , 540\nU. S., at 722; some internal quotation marks omitted). Judge Gruender dissented. He distinguished Locke on the ground that it concerned the narrow issue of\nfunding for the religious training of clergy, and “did not leave\nstates with unfettered discretion to exclude the religious from\ngenerally available public benefits.” 788 F. 3d, at 791\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Rehearing en banc was denied by an equally\ndivided court. We granted certiorari sub nom. Trinity\nLutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Pauley , 577\nU. S. ___ (2016), and now reverse.[ 1 ] II The First Amendment provides, in part, that\n“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of\nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” The parties\nagree that the Establishment Clause of that Amendment does not\nprevent Missouri from including Trinity Lutheran in the Scrap Tire\nProgram. That does not, however, answer the question under the Free\nExercise Clause, because we have recognized that there is “play in\nthe joints” between what the Establishment Clause permits and the\nFree Exercise Clause compels. Locke , 540 U. S., at 718\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Free Exercise Clause “protect[s] religious\nobservers against unequal treatment” and subjects to the strictest\nscrutiny laws that target the religious for “special disabilities”\nbased on their “religious status.” Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,\nInc. v. Hialeah , 508 U. S. 520, 533, 542 (1993)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Applying that basic principle,\nthis Court has repeatedly confirmed that denying a generally\navailable benefit solely on account of religious identity imposes a\npenalty on the free exercise of religion that can be justified only\nby a state interest “of the highest order.” McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U. S. 618, 628 (1978) (plurality opinion)\n(quoting Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U. S. 205, 215\n(1972) ). In Everson v. Board of\nEducation of Ewing , 330 U. S. 1 (1947) , for example, we\nupheld against an Establishment Clause challenge a New Jersey law\nenabling a local school district to reimburse parents for the\npublic transportation costs of sending their children to public and\nprivate schools, including parochial schools. In the course of\nruling that the Establishment Clause allowed New Jersey to extend\nthat public benefit to all its citizens regardless of their\nreligious belief, we explained that a State “cannot hamper its\ncitizens in the free exercise of their own religion. Consequently,\nit cannot exclude individual Catholics, Lutherans, Mohammedans,\nBaptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers, Presbyterians, or the\nmembers of any other faith, because of their faith, or lack of\nit , from receiving the benefits of public welfare legislation.” Id. , at 16. Three decades later, in McDaniel v. Paty , the Court struck down under the Free Exercise Clause a\nTennessee statute disqualifying ministers from serving as delegates\nto the State’s constitutional convention. Writing for the\nplurality, Chief Justice Burger acknowledged that Tennessee had\ndisqualified ministers from serving as legislators since the\nadoption of its first Constitution in 1796, and that a number of\nearly States had also disqualified ministers from legislative\noffice. This historical tradition, however, did not change the fact\nthat the statute discriminated against McDaniel by denying him a\nbenefit solely because of his “ status as a\n‘minister.’ ” 435 U. S., at 627. McDaniel could not seek\nto participate in the convention while also maintaining his role as\na minister; to pursue the one, he would have to give up the other.\nIn this way, said Chief Justice Burger, the Tennessee law\n“effectively penalizes the free exercise of [McDaniel’s]\nconstitutional liberties.” Id. , at 626 (quoting Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U. S. 398, 406 (1963) ;\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Joined by Justice Marshall in\nconcurrence, Justice Brennan added that “because the challenged\nprovision requires [McDaniel] to purchase his right to engage in\nthe ministry by sacrificing his candidacy it impairs the free\nexercise of his religion.” McDaniel , 435 U. S., at\n634. In recent years, when this Court has rejected\nfree exercise challenges, the laws in question have been neutral\nand generally applicable without regard to religion. We have been\ncareful to distinguish such laws from those that single out the\nreligious for disfavored treatment. For example, in Lyng v. Northwest\nIndian Cemetery Protective Association , 485 U. S. 439\n(1988) , we held that the Free Exercise Clause did not prohibit the\nGovernment from timber harvesting or road construction on a\nparticular tract of federal land, even though the Government’s\naction would obstruct the religious practice of several Native\nAmerican Tribes that held certain sites on the tract to be sacred.\nAccepting that “[t]he building of a road or the harvesting of\ntimber . . . would interfere significantly with private\npersons’ ability to pursue spiritual fulfillment according to their\nown religious beliefs,” we nonetheless found no free exercise\nviolation, because the affected individuals were not being “coerced\nby the Government’s action into violating their religious beliefs.” Id., at 449. The Court specifically noted, however, that the\nGovernment action did not “penalize religious activity by denying\nany person an equal share of the rights, benefits, and privileges\nenjoyed by other citizens.” Ibid. In Employment Division, Department of Human\nResources of Oregon v. Smith , 494 U. S. 872 (1990)\n, we rejected a free exercise claim brought by two members of a\nNative American church denied unemployment benefits because they\nhad violated Oregon’s drug laws by ingesting peyote for sacramental\npurposes. Along the same lines as our decision in Lyng , we\nheld that the Free Exercise Clause did not entitle the church\nmembers to a special dispensation from the general criminal laws on\naccount of their religion. At the same time, we again made clear\nthat the Free Exercise Clause did guard against the\ngovernment’s imposition of “special disabilities on the basis of\nreligious views or religious status.” 494 U. S., at 877\n(citing McDaniel , 435 U. S. 618 ).[ 2 ] Finally, in Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,\nInc. v. Hia-leah , we struck down three facially neutral\ncity ordinances that outlawed certain forms of animal slaughter.\nMembers of the Santeria religion challenged the ordinances under\nthe Free Exercise Clause, alleging that despite their facial\nneutrality, the ordinances had a discriminatory purpose easy to\nferret out: prohibiting sacrificial rituals integral to Santeria\nbut distasteful to local residents. We agreed. Before explaining\nwhy the challenged ordinances were not, in fact, neutral or\ngenerally applicable, the Court recounted the fundamentals of our\nfree exercise jurisprudence. A law, we said, may not discriminate\nagainst “some or all religious beliefs.” 508 U. S., at 532.\nNor may a law regulate or outlaw conduct because it is religiously\nmotivated. And, citing McDaniel and Smith , we\nrestated the now-familiar refrain: The Free Exercise Clause\nprotects against laws that “ ‘impose[ ] special\ndis-abilities on the basis of . . . religious\nstatus.’ ” 508 U. S., at 533 (quoting Smith , 494\nU. S., at 877); see also Mitchell v. Helms , 530\nU. S. 793, 828 (2000) (plurality opinion) (noting “our\ndecisions that have prohibited governments from discriminating in\nthe distribution of public benefits based upon religious status or\nsincerity” (citing Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of\nUniv. of Va. , 515 U. S. 819 (1995) ; Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist. , 508 U. S.\n384 (1993) ; Widmar v. Vincent , 454 U. S. 263\n(1981) )). III A The Department’s policy expressly\ndiscriminates against otherwise eligible recipients by\ndisqualifying them from a public benefit solely because of their\nreligious character. If the cases just described make one thing\nclear, it is that such a policy imposes a penalty on the free\nexercise of religion that triggers the most exacting scrutiny. Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546. This conclusion is\nunremarkable in light of our prior decisions. Like the disqualification statute in McDaniel , the Department’s policy puts Trinity Lutheran to a\nchoice: It may participate in an otherwise available benefit\nprogram or remain a religious institution. Of course, Trinity\nLu-theran is free to continue operating as a church, just as\nMcDaniel was free to continue being a minister. But that freedom\ncomes at the cost of automatic and absolute exclusion from the\nbenefits of a public program for which the Center is otherwise\nfully qualified. And when the State conditions a benefit in this\nway, McDaniel says plainly that the State has punished the\nfree exercise of religion: “To condition the availability of\nbenefits . . . upon [a recipient’s] willingness to\n. . . surrender[ ] his religiously impelled [status]\neffectively penalizes the free exercise of his constitutional\nliberties.” 435 U. S., at 626 (plurality opinion) (alterations\nomitted). The Department contends that merely declining to\nextend funds to Trinity Lutheran does not prohibit the\nChurch from engaging in any religious conduct or otherwise\nexercising its religious rights. In this sense, says the\nDepartment, its policy is unlike the ordinances struck down in Lukumi , which outlawed rituals central to Santeria. Here the\nDepartment has simply declined to allocate to Trinity Lutheran a\nsubsidy the State had no obligation to provide in the first place.\nThat decision does not meaningfully burden the Church’s free\nexercise rights. And absent any such burden, the argument\ncontinues, the Department is free to heed the State’s\nantiestablishment objection to providing funds directly to a\nchurch. Brief for Respondent 7–12, 14–16. It is true the Department has not criminalized\nthe way Trinity Lutheran worships or told the Church that it cannot\nsubscribe to a certain view of the Gospel. But, as the Department\nitself acknowledges, the Free Exercise Clause protects against\n“indirect coercion or penalties on the free exercise of religion,\nnot just outright prohibitions.” Lyng , 485 U. S., at\n450. As the Court put it more than 50 years ago, “[i]t is too late\nin the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression\nmay be infringed by the denial of or placing of conditions upon a\nbenefit or privilege.” Sherbert , 374 U. S., at 404; see\nalso McDaniel , 435 U. S., at 633 (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (The “proposition—that the law does not\ninterfere with free exercise because it does not directly prohibit\nreligious activity, but merely conditions eligibility for office on\nits abandonment—is . . . squarely rejected by\nprecedent”). Trinity Lutheran is not claiming any entitlement\nto a subsidy. It instead asserts a right to participate in a\ngovernment benefit program without having to disavow its religious\ncharacter. The “imposition of such a condition upon even a\ngratuitous benefit inevitably deter[s] or discourage[s] the\nexercise of First Amendment rights.” Sherbert , 374\nU. S., at 405. The express discrimination against religious\nexercise here is not the denial of a grant, but rather the refusal\nto allow the Church—solely because it is a church—to compete with\nsecular organizations for a grant. Cf. Northeastern Fla.\nChapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville , 508 U. S. 656, 666 (1993) (“[T]he ‘injury\nin fact’ is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the\nbidding process, not the loss of a contract”). Trinity Lutheran is\na member of the community too, and the State’s decision to exclude\nit for purposes of this public program must withstand the strictest\nscrutiny. B The Department attempts to get out from under\nthe weight of our precedents by arguing that the free exercise\nquestion in this case is instead controlled by our decision in Locke v. Davey . It is not. In Locke , the State\nof Washington created a scholarship program to assist\nhigh-achieving students with the costs of postsecondary education.\nThe scholarships were paid out of the State’s general fund, and\neligibility was based on criteria such as an applicant’s score on\ncollege admission tests and family income. While scholarship\nrecipients were free to use the money at accredited religious and\nnon-religious schools alike, they were not permitted to use the\nfunds to pursue a devotional theology degree—one “devotional in\nnature or designed to induce religious faith.” 540 U. S., at\n716 (internal quotation marks omitted). Davey was selected for a\nscholarship but was denied the funds when he refused to certify\nthat he would not use them toward a devotional degree. He sued,\narguing that the State’s refusal to allow its scholarship money to\ngo toward such degrees violated his free exercise rights. This Court disagreed. It began by explaining\nwhat was not at issue. Washington’s selective funding\nprogram was not comparable to the free exercise violations found in\nthe “ Lukumi line of cases,” including those striking down\nlaws requiring individuals to “choose between their religious\nbeliefs and receiving a government benefit.” Id. , at\n720–721. At the outset, then, the Court made clear that Locke was not like the case now before us. Washington’s restriction on the use of its\nscholarship funds was different. According to the Court, the State\nhad “merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction.” Id. , at 721. Davey was not denied a scholarship because of\nwho he was ; he was denied a scholarship because of what he\nproposed to do —use the funds to prepare for the ministry.\nHere there is no question that Trinity Lutheran was denied a grant\nsimply because of what it is—a church. The Court in Locke also stated that\nWashington’s choice was in keeping with the State’s\nantiestablishment interest in not using taxpayer funds to pay for\nthe training of clergy; in fact, the Court could “think of few\nareas in which a State’s antiestablishment interests come more into\nplay.” Id., at 722. The claimant in Locke sought\nfunding for an “essentially religious endeavor . . . akin\nto a religious calling as well as an academic pursuit,” and\nopposition to such funding “to support church leaders” lay at the\nhistoric core of the Religion Clauses. Id. , at 721–722. Here\nnothing of the sort can be said about a program to use recycled\ntires to resurface playgrounds. Relying on Locke , the Department\nnonetheless emphasizes Missouri’s similar constitutional tradition\nof not furnishing taxpayer money directly to churches. Brief for\nRespondent 15–16. But Locke took account of Washington’s\nantiestablishment interest only after determining, as noted, that\nthe scholarship program did not “require students to choose between\ntheir religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit.” 540\nU. S., at 720–721 (citing McDaniel , 435 U. S. 618\n). As the Court put it, Washington’s scholarship program went “a\nlong way toward including religion in its benefits.” Locke ,\n540 U. S., at 724. Students in the program were free to use\ntheir scholarships at “pervasively religious schools.” Ibid .\nDavey could use his scholarship to pursue a secular degree at one\ninstitution while studying devotional theology at another. Id., at 721, n. 4. He could also use his scholarship\nmoney to attend a religious college and take devotional theology\ncourses there. Id., at 725. The only thing he could not do\nwas use the scholarship to pursue a degree in that subject. In this case, there is no dispute that Trinity\nLutheran is put to the choice between being a church and\nreceiving a government benefit. The rule is simple: No churches\nneed apply.[ 3 ] C The State in this case expressly requires\nTrinity Lutheran to renounce its religious character in order to\nparticipate in an otherwise generally available public benefit\nprogram, for which it is fully qualified. Our cases make clear that\nsuch a condition imposes a penalty on the free exercise of religion\nthat must be subjected to the “most rigorous” scrutiny. Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546.[ 4 ] Under that stringent standard, only a state\ninterest “of the highest order” can justify the Department’s\ndiscriminatory policy. McDaniel , 435 U. S., at 628\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Yet the Department offers\nnothing more than Missouri’s policy preference for skating as far\nas possible from religious establishment concerns. Brief for\nRespondent 15–16. In the face of the clear infringement on free\nexercise before us, that interest cannot qual-ify as compelling. As\nwe said when considering Missouri’s same policy preference on a\nprior occasion, “",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus TRINITY LUTHERAN CHURCH OF COLUMBIA, INC. v . COMER, DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL\nRESOURCES certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eighth circuit No. 15–577. Argued April 19, 2017—Decided June\n26, 2017 The Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning\nCenter is a Missouri preschool and daycare center. Originally\nestablished as a nonprofit organization, the Center later merged\nwith Trinity Lutheran Church and now operates under its auspices on\nchurch property. Among the facilities at the Center is a\nplayground, which has a coarse pea gravel surface beneath much of\nthe play equipment. In 2012, the Center sought to replace a large\nportion of the pea gravel with a pour-in-place rubber surface by\nparticipating in Missouri’s Scrap Tire Program. The program, run by\nthe State’s Department of Natural Resources, offers reimbursement\ngrants to qualifying nonprofit organizations that install\nplayground surfaces made from recycled tires. The Department had a\nstrict and express policy of denying grants to any applicant owned\nor controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.\nPursuant to that policy, the Department denied the Center’s\napplication. In a letter rejecting that application, the Department\nexplained that under Article I, Section 7 of the Missouri\nConstitution, the Department could not provide financial assistance\ndirectly to a church. The Department ultimately awarded 14 grants\nas part of the 2012 program. Although the Center ranked fifth out\nof the 44 applicants, it did not receive a grant because it is a\nchurch. Trinity Lutheran sued in Federal District\nCourt, alleging that the Department’s failure to approve its\napplication violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment. The District Court dismissed the suit. The Free Exercise\nClause, the court stated, prohibits the government from outlawing\nor restricting the exercise of a religious practice, but it\ngenerally does not prohibit withholding an affirmative benefit on\naccount of religion. The District Court likened the case before it\nto Locke v. Davey , 540 U. S. 712 , where this\nCourt upheld against a free exercise challenge a State’s decision\nnot to fund degrees in devotional theology as part of a scholarship\nprogram. The District Court held that the Free Exercise Clause did\nnot require the State to make funds available under the Scrap Tire\nProgram to Trinity Lutheran. A divided panel of the Eighth Circuit\naffirmed. The fact that the State could award a scrap tire grant to\nTrinity Lutheran without running afoul of the Establishment Clause\nof the Federal Constitution, the court ruled, did not mean that the\nFree Exercise Clause compelled the State to disregard the broader\nantiestablishment principle reflected in its own Constitution. Held : The Department’s policy\nviolated the rights of Trinity Lutheran under the Free Exercise\nClause of the First Amendment by denying the Church an otherwise\navailable public benefit on account of its religious status.\nPp. 6–15. (a) This Court has repeatedly confirmed\nthat denying a generally available benefit solely on account of\nreligious identity imposes a penalty on the free exercise of\nreligion. Thus, in McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U. S.\n618 , the Court struck down a Tennessee statute disqualifying\nministers from serving as delegates to the State’s constitutional\nconvention. A plurality recognized that such a law discriminated\nagainst McDaniel by denying him a benefit solely because of his\n“ status as a ‘minister.’ ” Id., at 627. In\nrecent years, when rejecting free exercise challenges to neutral\nlaws of general applicability, the Court has been careful to\ndistinguish such laws from those that single out the religious for\ndisfavored treatment. See, e.g. , Lyng v. Northwest\nIndian Cemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U. S. 439 ; Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith , 494 U. S. 872 ; and Church of Lukumi Babalu\nAye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U. S. 520 . It has\nremained a fundamental principle of this Court’s free exercise\njurisprudence that laws imposing “special disabilities on the basis\nof . . . religious status” trigger the strictest\nscrutiny. Id. , at 533. Pp. 6–9. (b) The Department’s policy expressly\ndiscriminates against otherwise eligible recipients by\ndisqualifying them from a public benefit solely because of their\nreligious character. Like the disqualification statute in McDaniel , the Department’s policy puts Trinity Lutheran to a\nchoice: It may participate in an otherwise available benefit\nprogram or remain a religious institution. When the State\nconditions a benefit in this way, McDaniel says plainly that\nthe State has imposed a penalty on the free exercise of religion\nthat must withstand the most exacting scrutiny. 435 U. S., at\n626, 628. The Department contends that simply declining\nto allocate to Trinity Lutheran a subsidy the State had no\nobligation to provide does not meaningfully burden the Church’s\nfree exercise rights. Absent any such burden, the argument\ncontinues, the Department is free to follow the State’s\nantiestablishment objection to providing funds directly to a\nchurch. But, as even the Department acknowledges, the Free Exercise\nClause protects against “indirect coercion or penalties on the free\nexercise of religion, not just outright prohibitions.” Lyng ,\n485 U. S., at 450. Trinity Lutheran is not claiming any\nentitlement to a subsidy. It is asserting a right to participate in\na government benefit program without having to disavow its\nreligious character. The express discrimination against religious\nexercise here is not the denial of a grant, but rather the refusal\nto allow the Church—solely because it is a church—to compete with\nsecular organizations for a grant. Pp. 9–11. (c) The Department tries to sidestep this\nCourt’s precedents by arguing that this case is instead controlled\nby Locke v. Davey. It is not. In Locke , the\nState of Washington created a scholarship program to assist\nhigh-achieving students with the costs of postsecondary education.\nScholarship recipients were free to use state funds at accredited\nreligious and non-religious schools alike, but they could not use\nthe funds to pursue a devotional theology degree. At the outset,\nthe Court made clear that Locke was not like the cases in\nwhich the Court struck down laws requiring individuals to “choose\nbetween their religious beliefs and receiving a government\nbenefit.” 540 U. S., at 720–721. Davey was not denied a\nscholarship because of who he was ; he was denied a\nscholarship because of what he proposed to do . Here there is\nno question that Trinity Lutheran was denied a grant simply because\nof what it is—a church. The Court in Locke also stated that\nWashington’s restriction on the use of its funds was in keeping\nwith the State’s antiestablishment interest in not using taxpayer\nfunds to pay for the training of clergy, an “essentially religious\nendeavor,” id. , at 721. Here, nothing of the sort can be\nsaid about a program to use recycled tires to resurface\nplaygrounds. At any rate, the Court took account of Washington’s\nantiestablishment interest only after determining that the\nscholarship program did not “require students to choose between\ntheir religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit.” Id. , at 720–721. There is no dispute that Trinity Lutheran is put to the choice between being a church and receiving a\ngovernment benefit. Pp. 11–14. (d) The Department’s discriminatory\npolicy does not survive the “most rigorous” scrutiny that this\nCourt applies to laws imposing special disabilities on account of\nreligious status. Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546. That\nstandard demands a state interest “of the highest order” to justify\nthe policy at issue. McDaniel , 435 U. S., at 628\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Yet the Department offers\nnothing more than Missouri’s preference for skating as far as\npossible from religious establishment concerns. In the face of the\nclear infringement on free exercise before the Court, that interest\ncannot qualify as compelling. Pp. 14–15. 788 F. 3d 779, reversed and remanded. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, except as to footnote 3. Kennedy, Alito, and Kagan, JJ.,\njoined that opinion in full, and Thomas and Gorsuch, JJ., joined\nexcept as to footnote 3.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–577 _________________ TRINITY LUTHERAN CHURCH OF COLUMBIA, INC.,\nPETITIONER v. CAROL S. COMER, DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT\nOF NATURALRESOURCES on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eighth circuit [June 26, 2017] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, except as to footnote 3. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources\noffers state grants to help public and private schools, nonprofit\ndaycare centers, and other nonprofit entities purchase rubber\nplayground surfaces made from recycled tires. Trinity Lutheran\nChurch applied for such a grant for its preschool and daycare\ncenter and would have received one, but for the fact that Trinity\nLutheran is a church. The Department had a policy of categorically\ndisqualifying churches and other religious organizations from\nreceiving grants under its playground resurfacing program. The\nquestion presented is whether the Department’s policy violated the\nrights of Trinity Lutheran under the Free Exercise Clause of the\nFirst Amendment. I A The Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning\nCenter is a preschool and daycare center open throughout the year\nto serve working families in Boone County, Missouri, and the\nsurrounding area. Established as a nonprofit organization in 1980,\nthe Center merged with Trinity Lutheran Church in 1985 and operates\nunder its auspices on church property. The Center admits students\nof any religion, and enrollment stands at about 90 children ranging\nfrom age two to five. The Center includes a playground that is\nequipped with the basic playground essentials: slides, swings,\njungle gyms, monkey bars, and sandboxes. Almost the entire surface\nbeneath and surrounding the play equipment is coarse pea gravel.\nYoungsters, of course, often fall on the playground or tumble from\nthe equipment. And when they do, the gravel can be unforgiving. In 2012, the Center sought to replace a large\nportion of the pea gravel with a pour-in-place rubber surface by\nparticipating in Missouri’s Scrap Tire Program. Run by the State’s\nDepartment of Natural Resources to reduce the number of used tires\ndestined for landfills and dump sites, the program offers\nreimbursement grants to qualifying nonprofit organizations that\npurchase playground surfaces made from recycled tires. It is funded\nthrough a fee imposed on the sale of new tires in the State. Due to limited resources, the Department cannot\noffer grants to all applicants and so awards them on a competitive\nbasis to those scoring highest based on several criteria, such as\nthe poverty level of the population in the surrounding area and the\napplicant’s plan to promote recycling. When the Center applied, the\nDepartment had a strict and express policy of denying grants to any\napplicant owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious\nentity. That policy, in the Department’s view, was compelled by\nArticle I, Section 7 of the Missouri Constitution, which\nprovides: “That no money shall ever be taken from\nthe public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church,\nsect or denomination of religion, or in aid of any priest,\npreacher, minister or teacher thereof, as such; and that no\npreference shall be given to nor any discrimination made against\nany church, sect or creed of religion, or any form of religious\nfaith or worship.” In its application, the Center disclosed its\nstatus as a ministry of Trinity Lutheran Church and specified that\nthe Center’s mission was “to provide a safe, clean, and attractive\nschool facility in conjunction with an educational program\nstructured to allow a child to grow spiritually, physically,\nsocially, and cognitively.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 131a. After\ndescribing the playground and the safety hazards posed by its\ncurrent surface, the Center detailed the anticipated benefits of\nthe proposed project: increasing access to the playground for all\nchildren, including those with disabilities, by providing a surface\ncompliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\nproviding a safe, long-lasting, and resilient surface under the\nplay areas; and improving Missouri’s environment by putting\nrecycled tires to positive use. The Center also noted that the\nbenefits of a new surface would extend beyond its students to the\nlocal community, whose children often use the playground during\nnon-school hours. The Center ranked fifth among the 44 applicants\nin the 2012 Scrap Tire Program. But despite its high score, the\nCenter was deemed categorically ineligible to receive a grant. In a\nletter rejecting the Center’s application, the program director\nexplained that, under Article I, Section 7 of the Missouri\nConstitution, the Department could not provide financial assistance\ndirectly to a church. The Department ultimately awarded 14 grants as\npart of the 2012 program. Because the Center was operated by\nTrinity Lutheran Church, it did not receive a grant. B Trinity Lutheran sued the Director of the\nDepartment in Federal District Court. The Church alleged that the\nDepartment’s failure to approve the Center’s application, pursuant\nto its policy of denying grants to religiously affiliated\napplicants, violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment. Trinity Lutheran sought declara-tory and injunctive\nrelief prohibiting the Department from discriminating against the\nChurch on that basis in future grant applications. The District Court granted the Department’s\nmotion to dismiss. The Free Exercise Clause, the District Court\nstated, prohibits the government from outlawing or restricting the\nexercise of a religious practice; it generally does not prohibit\nwithholding an affirmative benefit on account of religion. The\nDistrict Court likened the Department’s denial of the scrap tire\ngrant to the situation this Court encountered in Locke v. Davey , 540 U. S. 712 (2004) . In that case, we upheld\nagainst a free exercise challenge the State of Washington’s\ndecision not to fund degrees in devotional theology as part of a\nstate scholarship program. Finding the present case “nearly\nindistinguishable from Locke ,” the District Court held that\nthe Free Exercise Clause did not require the State to make funds\navailable under the Scrap Tire Program to religious institutions\nlike Trinity Lutheran. Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia,\nInc. v. Pauley , 976 F. Supp. 2d 1137, 1151 (WD Mo.\n2013). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\naffirmed. The court recognized that it was “rather clear” that\nMissouri could award a scrap tire grant to Trinity Lutheran\nwithout running afoul of the Establishment Clause of the United\nStates Constitution. Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia,\nInc. v. Pauley , 788 F. 3d 779, 784 (2015). But, the\nCourt of Appeals explained, that did not mean the Free Exercise\nClause compelled the State to disregard the antiestablishment\nprinciple reflected in its own Constitution. Viewing a monetary\ngrant to a religious institution as a “ ‘hallmark[ ] of\nan established religion,’ ” the court concluded that the State\ncould rely on an applicant’s religious status to deny its\napplication. Id. , at 785 (quoting Locke , 540\nU. S., at 722; some internal quotation marks omitted). Judge Gruender dissented. He distinguished Locke on the ground that it concerned the narrow issue of\nfunding for the religious training of clergy, and “did not leave\nstates with unfettered discretion to exclude the religious from\ngenerally available public benefits.” 788 F. 3d, at 791\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Rehearing en banc was denied by an equally\ndivided court. We granted certiorari sub nom. Trinity\nLutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Pauley , 577\nU. S. ___ (2016), and now reverse.[ 1 ] II The First Amendment provides, in part, that\n“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of\nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” The parties\nagree that the Establishment Clause of that Amendment does not\nprevent Missouri from including Trinity Lutheran in the Scrap Tire\nProgram. That does not, however, answer the question under the Free\nExercise Clause, because we have recognized that there is “play in\nthe joints” between what the Establishment Clause permits and the\nFree Exercise Clause compels. Locke , 540 U. S., at 718\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Free Exercise Clause “protect[s] religious\nobservers against unequal treatment” and subjects to the strictest\nscrutiny laws that target the religious for “special disabilities”\nbased on their “religious status.” Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,\nInc. v. Hialeah , 508 U. S. 520, 533, 542 (1993)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Applying that basic principle,\nthis Court has repeatedly confirmed that denying a generally\navailable benefit solely on account of religious identity imposes a\npenalty on the free exercise of religion that can be justified only\nby a state interest “of the highest order.” McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U. S. 618, 628 (1978) (plurality opinion)\n(quoting Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U. S. 205, 215\n(1972) ). In Everson v. Board of\nEducation of Ewing , 330 U. S. 1 (1947) , for example, we\nupheld against an Establishment Clause challenge a New Jersey law\nenabling a local school district to reimburse parents for the\npublic transportation costs of sending their children to public and\nprivate schools, including parochial schools. In the course of\nruling that the Establishment Clause allowed New Jersey to extend\nthat public benefit to all its citizens regardless of their\nreligious belief, we explained that a State “cannot hamper its\ncitizens in the free exercise of their own religion. Consequently,\nit cannot exclude individual Catholics, Lutherans, Mohammedans,\nBaptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers, Presbyterians, or the\nmembers of any other faith, because of their faith, or lack of\nit , from receiving the benefits of public welfare legislation.” Id. , at 16. Three decades later, in McDaniel v. Paty , the Court struck down under the Free Exercise Clause a\nTennessee statute disqualifying ministers from serving as delegates\nto the State’s constitutional convention. Writing for the\nplurality, Chief Justice Burger acknowledged that Tennessee had\ndisqualified ministers from serving as legislators since the\nadoption of its first Constitution in 1796, and that a number of\nearly States had also disqualified ministers from legislative\noffice. This historical tradition, however, did not change the fact\nthat the statute discriminated against McDaniel by denying him a\nbenefit solely because of his “ status as a\n‘minister.’ ” 435 U. S., at 627. McDaniel could not seek\nto participate in the convention while also maintaining his role as\na minister; to pursue the one, he would have to give up the other.\nIn this way, said Chief Justice Burger, the Tennessee law\n“effectively penalizes the free exercise of [McDaniel’s]\nconstitutional liberties.” Id. , at 626 (quoting Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U. S. 398, 406 (1963) ;\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Joined by Justice Marshall in\nconcurrence, Justice Brennan added that “because the challenged\nprovision requires [McDaniel] to purchase his right to engage in\nthe ministry by sacrificing his candidacy it impairs the free\nexercise of his religion.” McDaniel , 435 U. S., at\n634. In recent years, when this Court has rejected\nfree exercise challenges, the laws in question have been neutral\nand generally applicable without regard to religion. We have been\ncareful to distinguish such laws from those that single out the\nreligious for disfavored treatment. For example, in Lyng v. Northwest\nIndian Cemetery Protective Association , 485 U. S. 439\n(1988) , we held that the Free Exercise Clause did not prohibit the\nGovernment from timber harvesting or road construction on a\nparticular tract of federal land, even though the Government’s\naction would obstruct the religious practice of several Native\nAmerican Tribes that held certain sites on the tract to be sacred.\nAccepting that “[t]he building of a road or the harvesting of\ntimber . . . would interfere significantly with private\npersons’ ability to pursue spiritual fulfillment according to their\nown religious beliefs,” we nonetheless found no free exercise\nviolation, because the affected individuals were not being “coerced\nby the Government’s action into violating their religious beliefs.” Id., at 449. The Court specifically noted, however, that the\nGovernment action did not “penalize religious activity by denying\nany person an equal share of the rights, benefits, and privileges\nenjoyed by other citizens.” Ibid. In Employment Division, Department of Human\nResources of Oregon v. Smith , 494 U. S. 872 (1990)\n, we rejected a free exercise claim brought by two members of a\nNative American church denied unemployment benefits because they\nhad violated Oregon’s drug laws by ingesting peyote for sacramental\npurposes. Along the same lines as our decision in Lyng , we\nheld that the Free Exercise Clause did not entitle the church\nmembers to a special dispensation from the general criminal laws on\naccount of their religion. At the same time, we again made clear\nthat the Free Exercise Clause did guard against the\ngovernment’s imposition of “special disabilities on the basis of\nreligious views or religious status.” 494 U. S., at 877\n(citing McDaniel , 435 U. S. 618 ).[ 2 ] Finally, in Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye,\nInc. v. Hia-leah , we struck down three facially neutral\ncity ordinances that outlawed certain forms of animal slaughter.\nMembers of the Santeria religion challenged the ordinances under\nthe Free Exercise Clause, alleging that despite their facial\nneutrality, the ordinances had a discriminatory purpose easy to\nferret out: prohibiting sacrificial rituals integral to Santeria\nbut distasteful to local residents. We agreed. Before explaining\nwhy the challenged ordinances were not, in fact, neutral or\ngenerally applicable, the Court recounted the fundamentals of our\nfree exercise jurisprudence. A law, we said, may not discriminate\nagainst “some or all religious beliefs.” 508 U. S., at 532.\nNor may a law regulate or outlaw conduct because it is religiously\nmotivated. And, citing McDaniel and Smith , we\nrestated the now-familiar refrain: The Free Exercise Clause\nprotects against laws that “ ‘impose[ ] special\ndis-abilities on the basis of . . . religious\nstatus.’ ” 508 U. S., at 533 (quoting Smith , 494\nU. S., at 877); see also Mitchell v. Helms , 530\nU. S. 793, 828 (2000) (plurality opinion) (noting “our\ndecisions that have prohibited governments from discriminating in\nthe distribution of public benefits based upon religious status or\nsincerity” (citing Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of\nUniv. of Va. , 515 U. S. 819 (1995) ; Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist. , 508 U. S.\n384 (1993) ; Widmar v. Vincent , 454 U. S. 263\n(1981) )). III A The Department’s policy expressly\ndiscriminates against otherwise eligible recipients by\ndisqualifying them from a public benefit solely because of their\nreligious character. If the cases just described make one thing\nclear, it is that such a policy imposes a penalty on the free\nexercise of religion that triggers the most exacting scrutiny. Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546. This conclusion is\nunremarkable in light of our prior decisions. Like the disqualification statute in McDaniel , the Department’s policy puts Trinity Lutheran to a\nchoice: It may participate in an otherwise available benefit\nprogram or remain a religious institution. Of course, Trinity\nLu-theran is free to continue operating as a church, just as\nMcDaniel was free to continue being a minister. But that freedom\ncomes at the cost of automatic and absolute exclusion from the\nbenefits of a public program for which the Center is otherwise\nfully qualified. And when the State conditions a benefit in this\nway, McDaniel says plainly that the State has punished the\nfree exercise of religion: “To condition the availability of\nbenefits . . . upon [a recipient’s] willingness to\n. . . surrender[ ] his religiously impelled [status]\neffectively penalizes the free exercise of his constitutional\nliberties.” 435 U. S., at 626 (plurality opinion) (alterations\nomitted). The Department contends that merely declining to\nextend funds to Trinity Lutheran does not prohibit the\nChurch from engaging in any religious conduct or otherwise\nexercising its religious rights. In this sense, says the\nDepartment, its policy is unlike the ordinances struck down in Lukumi , which outlawed rituals central to Santeria. Here the\nDepartment has simply declined to allocate to Trinity Lutheran a\nsubsidy the State had no obligation to provide in the first place.\nThat decision does not meaningfully burden the Church’s free\nexercise rights. And absent any such burden, the argument\ncontinues, the Department is free to heed the State’s\nantiestablishment objection to providing funds directly to a\nchurch. Brief for Respondent 7–12, 14–16. It is true the Department has not criminalized\nthe way Trinity Lutheran worships or told the Church that it cannot\nsubscribe to a certain view of the Gospel. But, as the Department\nitself acknowledges, the Free Exercise Clause protects against\n“indirect coercion or penalties on the free exercise of religion,\nnot just outright prohibitions.” Lyng , 485 U. S., at\n450. As the Court put it more than 50 years ago, “[i]t is too late\nin the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression\nmay be infringed by the denial of or placing of conditions upon a\nbenefit or privilege.” Sherbert , 374 U. S., at 404; see\nalso McDaniel , 435 U. S., at 633 (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring in judgment) (The “proposition—that the law does not\ninterfere with free exercise because it does not directly prohibit\nreligious activity, but merely conditions eligibility for office on\nits abandonment—is . . . squarely rejected by\nprecedent”). Trinity Lutheran is not claiming any entitlement\nto a subsidy. It instead asserts a right to participate in a\ngovernment benefit program without having to disavow its religious\ncharacter. The “imposition of such a condition upon even a\ngratuitous benefit inevitably deter[s] or discourage[s] the\nexercise of First Amendment rights.” Sherbert , 374\nU. S., at 405. The express discrimination against religious\nexercise here is not the denial of a grant, but rather the refusal\nto allow the Church—solely because it is a church—to compete with\nsecular organizations for a grant. Cf. Northeastern Fla.\nChapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville , 508 U. S. 656, 666 (1993) (“[T]he ‘injury\nin fact’ is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the\nbidding process, not the loss of a contract”). Trinity Lutheran is\na member of the community too, and the State’s decision to exclude\nit for purposes of this public program must withstand the strictest\nscrutiny. B The Department attempts to get out from under\nthe weight of our precedents by arguing that the free exercise\nquestion in this case is instead controlled by our decision in Locke v. Davey . It is not. In Locke , the State\nof Washington created a scholarship program to assist\nhigh-achieving students with the costs of postsecondary education.\nThe scholarships were paid out of the State’s general fund, and\neligibility was based on criteria such as an applicant’s score on\ncollege admission tests and family income. While scholarship\nrecipients were free to use the money at accredited religious and\nnon-religious schools alike, they were not permitted to use the\nfunds to pursue a devotional theology degree—one “devotional in\nnature or designed to induce religious faith.” 540 U. S., at\n716 (internal quotation marks omitted). Davey was selected for a\nscholarship but was denied the funds when he refused to certify\nthat he would not use them toward a devotional degree. He sued,\narguing that the State’s refusal to allow its scholarship money to\ngo toward such degrees violated his free exercise rights. This Court disagreed. It began by explaining\nwhat was not at issue. Washington’s selective funding\nprogram was not comparable to the free exercise violations found in\nthe “ Lukumi line of cases,” including those striking down\nlaws requiring individuals to “choose between their religious\nbeliefs and receiving a government benefit.” Id. , at\n720–721. At the outset, then, the Court made clear that Locke was not like the case now before us. Washington’s restriction on the use of its\nscholarship funds was different. According to the Court, the State\nhad “merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction.” Id. , at 721. Davey was not denied a scholarship because of\nwho he was ; he was denied a scholarship because of what he\nproposed to do —use the funds to prepare for the ministry.\nHere there is no question that Trinity Lutheran was denied a grant\nsimply because of what it is—a church. The Court in Locke also stated that\nWashington’s choice was in keeping with the State’s\nantiestablishment interest in not using taxpayer funds to pay for\nthe training of clergy; in fact, the Court could “think of few\nareas in which a State’s antiestablishment interests come more into\nplay.” Id., at 722. The claimant in Locke sought\nfunding for an “essentially religious endeavor . . . akin\nto a religious calling as well as an academic pursuit,” and\nopposition to such funding “to support church leaders” lay at the\nhistoric core of the Religion Clauses. Id. , at 721–722. Here\nnothing of the sort can be said about a program to use recycled\ntires to resurface playgrounds. Relying on Locke , the Department\nnonetheless emphasizes Missouri’s similar constitutional tradition\nof not furnishing taxpayer money directly to churches. Brief for\nRespondent 15–16. But Locke took account of Washington’s\nantiestablishment interest only after determining, as noted, that\nthe scholarship program did not “require students to choose between\ntheir religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit.” 540\nU. S., at 720–721 (citing McDaniel , 435 U. S. 618\n). As the Court put it, Washington’s scholarship program went “a\nlong way toward including religion in its benefits.” Locke ,\n540 U. S., at 724. Students in the program were free to use\ntheir scholarships at “pervasively religious schools.” Ibid .\nDavey could use his scholarship to pursue a secular degree at one\ninstitution while studying devotional theology at another. Id., at 721, n. 4. He could also use his scholarship\nmoney to attend a religious college and take devotional theology\ncourses there. Id., at 725. The only thing he could not do\nwas use the scholarship to pursue a degree in that subject. In this case, there is no dispute that Trinity\nLutheran is put to the choice between being a church and\nreceiving a government benefit. The rule is simple: No churches\nneed apply.[ 3 ] C The State in this case expressly requires\nTrinity Lutheran to renounce its religious character in order to\nparticipate in an otherwise generally available public benefit\nprogram, for which it is fully qualified. Our cases make clear that\nsuch a condition imposes a penalty on the free exercise of religion\nthat must be subjected to the “most rigorous” scrutiny. Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546.[ 4 ] Under that stringent standard, only a state\ninterest “of the highest order” can justify the Department’s\ndiscriminatory policy. McDaniel , 435 U. S., at 628\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Yet the Department offers\nnothing more than Missouri’s policy preference for skating as far\nas possible from religious establishment concerns. Brief for\nRespondent 15–16. In the face of the clear infringement on free\nexercise before us, that interest cannot qual-ify as compelling. As\nwe said when considering Missouri’s same policy preference on a\nprior occasion, “",

No. 16–1436 (16A1190) v. INTERNATIONAL REFUGEE ASSISTANCE PROJECT, et al. on application for stay and petition for writ\nof certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fourth\ncircuit DONALD J.

HAWAII, et al. on application for stay and petition for writ\nof certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth\ncircuit [June 26, 2017] Per Curiam. These cases involve challenges to Executive\nOrder No. 13780, Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry\nInto the United States. The order alters practices concerning the\nentry of foreign nationals into the United States by, among other\nthings, suspending entry of nationals from six designated countries\nfor 90 days. Respondents challenged the order in two separate\nlawsuits. They obtained preliminary injunctions barring enforcement\nof several of its provisions, including the 90-day suspension of\nentry. The injunctions were upheld in large measure by the Courts\nof Appeals. The Government filed separate petitions for\ncertiorari, as well as applications to stay the preliminary\ninjunctions entered by the lower courts. We grant the petitions for\ncertiorari and grant the stay applications in part. I A On January 27, 2017, President Donald J. Trump\nsigned Executive Order No. 13769, Protecting the Nation From\nForeign Terrorist Entry Into the United States. 82 Fed. Reg. 8977\n(EO–1). EO–1 addressed policies and procedures relating to the\nentry of foreign nationals into this country. Among other\ndirectives, the order suspended entry of foreign nationals from\nseven countries identified as presenting heightened terrorism\nrisks—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—for 90\ndays. §3(c). Executive officials were instructed to review the\nadequacy of current practices relating to visa adjudications during\nthis 90-day period. §3(a). EO–1 also modified refugee policy,\nsuspending the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for\n120 days and reducing the number of refugees eligible to be\nadmitted to the United States during fiscal year 2017. §§5(a),\n(d). EO–1 was immediately challenged in court. Just a\nweek after the order was issued, a Federal District Court entered a\nnationwide temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement of\nseveral of its key provisions. Washington v. Trump ,\n2017 WL 462040 (WD Wash., Feb. 3, 2017). Six days later, the Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the Government’s emergency\nmotion to stay the order pending appeal. Washington v. Trump , 847 F. 3d 1151 (2017). Rather than continue to\nlitigate EO–1, the Government announced that it would revoke the\norder and issue a new one. A second order followed on March 6, 2017. See\nProtecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United\nStates, Exec. Order No. 13780, 82 Fed. Reg. 13209 (EO–2). EO–2\ndescribes “conditions in six of the . . . countries” as\nto which EO–1 had suspended entry, stating that these conditions\n“demonstrate [that] nationals [of those countries] continue to\npresent heightened risks to the security of the United States,”\n§1(e), and that “some of those who have entered the United States\nthrough our immigration system have proved to be threats to our\nnational security,” §1(h). Having identified these concerns, EO–2 sets out\na series of directives patterned on those found in EO–1. Several\nare relevant here. First, EO–2 directs the Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity to conduct a global review to determine whether foreign\ngovernments provide adequate information about nationals applying\nfor United States visas. §2(a). EO–2 directs the Secretary to\nreport his findings to the President within 20 days of the order’s\n“effective date,” after which time those nations identified as\ndeficient will be given 50 days to alter their practices. §§2(b),\n(d)–(e). Second, EO–2 directs that entry of nationals\nfrom six of the seven countries designated in EO–1—Iran, Libya,\nSomalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—be “suspended for 90 days from the\neffective date” of the order. §2(c). EO–2 explains that this pause\nis necessary to ensure that dangerous individuals do not enter the\nUnited States while the Executive is working to establish “adequate\nstandards . . . to prevent infiltration by foreign\nterrorists”; in addition, suspending entry will “temporarily reduce\ninvestigative burdens on agencies” during the Secretary’s 20-day\nreview. Ibid. A separate section provides for case-by-case\nwaivers of the entry bar. §3(c). Third, EO–2 suspends “decisions on applications\nfor refugee status” and “travel of refugees into the United States\nunder the USRAP” for 120 days following its effective date. §6(a).\nDuring that period, the Secretary of State is instructed to review\nthe adequacy of USRAP application and adjudication procedures and\nimplement whatever additional procedures are necessary “to ensure\nthat individuals seeking admission as refugees do not pose a\nthreat” to national security. Ibid. Fourth, citing the President’s determination\nthat “the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017\nwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States,” EO–2\n“suspend[s] any entries in excess of that number” for this fiscal\nyear. §6(b). Finally, §14 of EO–2 establishes the order’s\neffective date: March 16, 2017. B Respondents in these cases filed separate\nlawsuits challenging EO–2. As relevant, they argued that the order\nviolates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because it\nwas motivated not by concerns pertaining to national security, but\nby animus toward Islam. They further argued that EO–2 does not\ncomply with certain provisions in the Immigration and Nationality\nAct (INA), 66Stat. 187, as amended. In No. 16–1436, a Federal District Court\nconcluded that respondents were likely to succeed on their\nEstablishment Clause claim with respect to §2(c) of EO–2—the\nprovision temporarily suspending entry from six countries—and\nentered a nationwide preliminary injunction barring the Government\nfrom enforcing §2(c) against any foreign national seeking entry to\nthe United States. International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump , ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, 2017 WL 1018235 (D Md.,\nMar. 16, 2017) ( IRAP ). The District Court in No.\n16–1540—likewise relying on the Establishment Clause—entered a\nbroader preliminary injunction: The court enjoined nationwide\nenforcement of all of §§2 and 6. Hawaii v. Trump , ___\nF. Supp. 3d ___, 2017 WL 1167383 (D Haw., Mar. 29, 2017)\n(entering preliminary injunction); ___ F. Supp. 3d ___, 2017\nWL 1011673 (D Haw., Mar. 15, 2017) (entering temporary restraining\norder). In addition to the §2(c) suspension of entry, this\ninjunction covered the §6(a) suspension of refugee admissions, the\n§6(b) reduction in the refugee cap, and the provisions in §§2 and 6\npertaining only to internal executive review. These orders, entered before EO–2 went into\neffect, prevented the Government from initiating enforcement of the\nchallenged provisions. The Government filed appeals in both\ncases. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\nruled first. On May 25, over three dissenting votes, the en banc\ncourt issued a decision in IRAP that largely upheld the\norder enjoining enforcement of §2(c). 857 F. 3d 554. The\nmajor-ity determined that respondent John Doe #1, a lawful\npermanent resident whose Iranian wife is seeking entry to the\nUnited States, was likely to succeed on the merits of his\nEstablishment Clause claim. The majority concluded that the primary\npurpose of §2(c) was religious, in violation of the First\nAmendment: A reasonable observer familiar with all the\ncircumstances—including the predominantly Muslim character of the\ndesignated countries and statements made by President Trump during\nhis Presidential campaign—would conclude that §2(c) was moti-vated\nprincipally by a desire to exclude Muslims from the United States,\nnot by considerations relating to national security. Having reached\nthis conclusion, the court upheld the preliminary injunction\nprohibiting enforcement of §2(c) against any foreign national\nseeking to enter this country. On June 1, the Government filed a petition for\ncertiorari seeking review of the Fourth Circuit’s decision. It also\nfiled applications seeking stays of both injunctions, including the Hawaii injunction still pending before the Ninth Circuit. In\naddition, the Government requested that this Court expedite the\ncertiorari stage briefing. We accordingly directed respondents to\nfile responses to the stay appli-cations by June 12 and respondents\nin IRAP to file a brief in opposition to the Government’s\npetition for certiorari by the same day. Respondents’ June 12 filings injected a new\nissue into the cases. In IRAP , respondents argued that the\nsuspension of entry in §2(c) would expire on June 14. Section 2(c),\nthey reasoned, directs that entry “be suspended for 90 days from\nthe effective date of” EO–2. The “effective date” of EO–2 was March\n16. §14. Although courts had enjoined portions of EO–2, they had\nnot altered its effective date, nor so much as mentioned §14. Thus,\neven though it had never been enforced, the entry suspension would\nexpire 90 days from March 16: June 14. At that time, the dispute\nover §2(c) would become moot. Brief in Opposition 13–14. On the same day respondents filed, the Ninth\nCircuit ruled in Hawaii . ___ F. 3d ___, 2017 WL 2529640\n(June 12, 2017) ( per curiam ). A unanimous panel held\nin favor of respondents the State of Hawaii and Dr. Ismail Elshikh,\nan American citizen and imam whose Syrian mother-in-law is seeking\nentry to this country. Rather than rely on the constitutional\ngrounds supporting the District Court’s decision, the court held\nthat portions of EO–2 likely exceeded the President’s authority\nunder the INA. On that basis it upheld the injunction as to the\n§2(c) entry suspension, the §6(a) suspension of refugee admissions,\nand the §6(b) refugee cap. The Ninth Circuit, like the Fourth\nCircuit, concluded that the injunction should bar enforcement of\nthese provisions across the board, because they would violate the\nINA “in all applications.” Id ., at *28. The court did,\nhowever, narrow the injunction so that it would not bar the\nGovernment from undertaking the internal executive reviews directed\nby EO–2. We granted the parties’ requests for\nsupplemental briefing addressed to the decision of the Ninth\nCircuit. Before those briefs were filed, however, the ground\nshifted again. On June 14, evidently in response to the argument\nthat §2(c) was about to expire, President Trump issued a memorandum\nto Executive Branch officials. The memorandum declared the\neffective date of each enjoined provision of EO–2 to be the date on\nwhich the injunctions in these cases “are lifted or stayed with\nrespect to that provision.” Presidential Memorandum for the\nSecretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland\nSecurity, and the Director of National Intelligence (June 14,\n2017). The memorandum further provided that, to the extent\nnecessary, it “should be construed to amend the Executive Order.” Ibid. The Government takes the view that, if any mootness\nproblem existed previously, the President’s memorandum has cured\nit. The parties have since completed briefing, with\nthe Government requesting that we construe its supplemental brief\nin Hawaii as a petition for certiorari. There is no\nobjection from respondents, and we do so. Both petitions for\ncertiorari and both stay applications are accordingly ripe for\nconsideration. II The Government seeks review on several issues.\nIn IRAP , the Government argues that respondent Doe lacks\nstanding to challenge §2(c).[ 1 ]* The Government also contends that Doe’s Establishment\nClause claim fails on the merits. In its view, the Fourth Circuit\nshould not have asked whether §2(c) has a primarily religious\npurpose. The court instead should have upheld EO–2 because it rests\non the “facially legitimate and bona fide” justification of\nprotecting national security. Kleindienst v. Mandel ,\n408 U. S. 753, 770 (1972). In addition, the Fourth Circuit\nerred by focusing on the President’s campaign-trail comments to\nconclude that §2(c)—religiously neutral on its face—nonetheless has\na principally religious purpose. At the very least, the Government\nargues, the injunction is too broad. In Hawaii , the Government likewise argues\nthat respondents Hawaii and Dr. Elshikh lack standing and that (at\na minimum) the injunction should be narrowed. The Government’s\nprincipal merits contention pertains to a statutory provision\nauthorizing the President to “suspend the entry of all aliens or\nany class of aliens” to this country “[w]henever [he] finds that\nthe entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens . . .\nwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.” 8\nU. S. C. §1182(f). The Ninth Circuit held that “[t]here\nis no sufficient finding in [EO–2] that the entry of the excluded\nclasses would be detrimental to the interests of the United\nStates.” Hawaii , 2017 WL 2529640, at *14. This, the\nGovernment argues, constitutes impermissible judicial\nsecond-guessing of the President’s judgment on a matter of national\nsecurity. In addition to seeking certiorari, the\nGovernment asks the Court to stay the injunctions entered below,\nthereby permitting the enjoined provisions to take effect.\nAccording to the Government, it is likely to suffer irreparable\nharm unless a stay issues. Focusing mostly on §2(c), and pointing\nto the descriptions of conditions in the six designated nations,\nthe Government argues that a 90-day pause on entry is necessary to\nprevent potentially dangerous individuals from entering the United\nStates while the Executive reviews the adequacy of information\nprovided by foreign governments in connection with visa\nadjudications. Additionally, the Government asserts, the temporary\nbar is needed to reduce the Executive’s investigative burdens while\nthis review proceeds. A To begin, we grant both of the Government’s\npetitions for certiorari and consolidate the cases for argument.\nThe Clerk is directed to set a briefing schedule that will permit\nthe cases to be heard during the first session of October Term\n2017. (The Government has not requested that we expedite\nconsideration of the merits to a greater extent.) In addition to\nthe issues identified in the petitions, the parties are directed to\naddress the following question: “Whether the challenges to §2(c)\nbecame moot on June 14, 2017.” B We now turn to the preliminary injunctions\nbarring enforcement of the §2(c) entry suspension. We grant the\nGovernment’s applications to stay the injunctions, to the extent\nthe injunctions prevent enforcement of §2(c) with respect to\nforeign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person\nor entity in the United States. We leave the injunctions entered by\nthe lower courts in place with respect to respondents and those\nsimilarly situated, as specified in this opinion. See infra, at 11–12. Crafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise\nof discretion and judgment, often dependent as much on the equities\nof a given case as the substance of the legal issues it presents.\nSee Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council , Inc. , 555 U. S. 7, 20, 24 (2008) ; 11A C. Wright, A.\nMiller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure §2948 (3d ed.\n2013). The purpose of such interim equitable relief is not to\nconclusively determine the rights of the parties, University of\nTex. v. Camenisch , 451 U. S. 390, 395 (1981) , but\nto balance the equities as the litigation moves forward. In\nawarding a preliminary injunction a court must also “conside[r]\n. . . the overall public interest.” Winter , supra , at 26. In the course of doing so, a court “need not\ngrant the total relief sought by the applicant but may mold its\ndecree to meet the exigencies of the particular case.” Wright, supra , §2947, at 115. Here, of course, we are not asked to grant a\npreliminary injunction, but to stay one. In assessing the lower\ncourts’ exercise of equitable discretion, we bring to bear an\nequitable judgment of our own. Nken v. Holder , 556\nU. S. 418, 433 (2009) . Before issuing a stay, “[i]t is\nultimately necessary . . . to balance the equities—to\nexplore the relative harms to applicant and respondent, as well as\nthe interests of the public at large.” Barnes v. E-Systems, Inc. Group Hospital Medical & Surgical Ins.\nPlan , 501 U. S. 1301, 1305 (1991) (Scalia, J., in\nchambers) (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court may, in\nits discretion, tailor a stay so that it operates with respect to\nonly “some portion of the proceeding.” Nken , supra ,\nat 428. The courts below took account of the equities in\nfashioning interim relief, focusing specifically on the concrete\nburdens that would fall on Doe, Dr. Elshikh, and Hawaii if §2(c)\nwere enforced. They reasoned that §2(c) would “directly affec[t]”\nDoe and Dr. Elshikh by delaying entry of their family members to\nthe United States. IRAP , 857 F. 3d, at 585, n. 11; see Hawaii , 2017 WL 2529640, at *7–*8, *24. The Ninth Circuit\nconcluded that §2(c) would harm the State by preventing students\nfrom the desig-nated nations who had been admitted to the\nUniversity of Hawaii from entering this country. These hardships,\nthe courts reasoned, were sufficiently weighty and immediate to\noutweigh the Government’s interest in enforcing §2(c). Having\nadopted this view of the equities, the courts approved injunctions\nthat covered not just respondents, but parties similarly situated\nto them—that is, people or entities in the United States who have\nrelationships with foreign nationals abroad, and whose rights might\nbe affected if those foreign nationals were excluded. See Mandel , 408 U. S., at 763–765 (permitting American\nplaintiffs to challenge the exclusion of a foreign national on the\nground that the exclusion violated their own First Amendment\nrights). But the injunctions reach much further than\nthat: They also bar enforcement of §2(c) against foreign nationals\nabroad who have no connection to the United States at all. The\nequities relied on by the lower courts do not balance the same way\nin that context. Denying entry to such a foreign national does not\nburden any American party by reason of that party’s relationship\nwith the foreign national. And the courts below did not conclude\nthat exclusion in such circumstances would impose any legally\nrelevant hardship on the foreign national himself. See id .,\nat 762 (“[A]n unadmitted and nonresident alien . . .\nha[s] no constitutional right of entry to this country”). So\nwhatever burdens may result from enforcement of §2(c) against a\nforeign national who lacks any connection to this country, they\nare, at a minimum, a good deal less concrete than the hardships\nidentified by the courts below. At the same time, the Government’s interest in\nenforcing §2(c), and the Executive’s authority to do so, are\nundoubtedly at their peak when there is no tie between the foreign\nnational and the United States. Indeed, EO–2 itself distinguishes\nbetween foreign nationals who have some connection to this country,\nand foreign nationals who do not, by establishing a case-by-case\nwaiver system primarily for the benefit of individuals in the\nformer cate-gory. See, e.g. , §§3(c)(i)–(vi). The interest in\npreserving national security is “an urgent objective of the highest\norder.” Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project , 561\nU. S. 1, 28 (2010) . To prevent the Government from pursuing\nthat objective by enforcing §2(c) against foreign nationals\nunconnected to the United States would appreciably injure its\ninterests, without alleviating obvious hardship to anyone else. We accordingly grant the Government’s stay\napplications in part and narrow the scope of the injunctions as to\n§2(c). The injunctions remain in place only with respect to parties\nsimilarly situated to Doe, Dr. Elshikh, and Hawaii. In practical\nterms, this means that §2(c) may not be enforced against foreign\nnationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship\nwith a person or entity in the United States. All other foreign\nnationals are subject to the provisions of EO–2. The facts of these cases illustrate the sort of\nrelationship that qualifies. For individuals, a close familial\nrelationship is required. A foreign national who wishes to enter\nthe United States to live with or visit a family member, like Doe’s\nwife or Dr. Elshikh’s mother-in-law, clearly has such a\nrelationship. As for entities, the relationship must be formal,\ndocumented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the\npurpose of evading EO–2. The students from the designated countries\nwho have been admitted to the University of Hawaii have such a\nrelationship with an American entity. So too would a worker who\naccepted an offer of employment from an American company or a\nlecturer invited to address an American audience. Not so someone\nwho enters into a relationship sim-ply to avoid §2(c): For example,\na nonprofit group devoted to immigration issues may not contact\nforeign nationals from the designated countries, add them to client\nlists, and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their\nexclusion. In light of the June 12 decision of the Ninth\nCircuit vacating the injunction as to §2(a), the executive review\ndirected by that subsection may proceed promptly, if it is not\nalready underway. EO–2 instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security\nto complete this review within 20 days, after which time foreign\ngovernments will be given 50 days further to bring their practices\ninto line with the Secretary’s directives. §§2(a)–(b), (d). Given\nthe Government’s representations in this litigation concerning the\nresources required to complete the 20-day review, we fully expect\nthat the relief we grant today will permit the Executive to\nconclude its internal work and provide adequate notice to foreign\ngovernments within the 90-day life of §2(c). C The Hawaii injunction extends beyond\n§2(c) to bar enforcement of the §6(a) suspension of refugee\nadmissions and the §6(b) refugee cap. In our view, the equitable\nbalance struck above applies in this context as well. An American\nindividual or entity that has a bona fide relationship with a\nparticular person seeking to enter the country as a refugee can\nlegitimately claim concrete hardship if that person is excluded. As\nto these individuals and entities, we do not disturb the\ninjunction. But when it comes to refugees who lack any such\nconnection to the United States, for the reasons we have set out,\nthe balance tips in favor of the Government’s compelling need to\nprovide for the Nation’s security. See supra, at 9–11; Haig v. Agee , 453 U. S. 280, 307 (1981) . The Government’s application to stay the\ninjunction with respect to §§6(a) and (b) is accordingly granted in\npart. Section 6(a) may not be enforced against an individual\nseeking admission as a refugee who can credibly claim a bona fide\nrelationship with a person or entity in the United States. Nor may\n§6(b); that is, such a person may not be excluded pursuant to\n§6(b), even if the 50,000-person cap has been reached or exceeded.\nAs applied to all other individuals, the provisions may take\neffect. *  *  * Accordingly, the petitions for certiorari are\ngranted, and the stay applications are granted in part. It is so ordered. Notes 1 * On June 24, 2017, this\nCourt received a letter from counsel for Doe advising that Doe’s\nwife received an immigrant visa on or about June 22, 2017. The\nparties may address the significance of that development at the\nmerits stage. It does not affect our analysis of the stay issues in\nthese cases.",

    "fulltext": " SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES MARISA N. PAVAN, et al. v. NATHANIEL SMITH on petition for writ of certiorari to the\nsupreme court of arkansas No. 16–992. Decided June 26, 2017 Per Curiam. As this Court explained in Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___ (2015), the Constitution entitles\nsame-sex couples to civil marriage “on the same terms and\nconditions as opposite-sex couples.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 23). In the decision below, the Arkansas Supreme Court\nconsidered the effect of that holding on the State’s rules\ngoverning the issuance of birth certificates. When a married woman\ngives birth in Arkansas, state law generally requires the name of\nthe mother’s male spouse to appear on the child’s birth\ncertificate—regardless of his biological relationship to the child.\nAccording to the court below, however, Arkansas need not extend\nthat rule to similarly situated same-sex couples: The State need\nnot, in other words, issue birth certificates including the female\nspouses of women who give birth in the State. Because that\ndifferential treatment infringes Obergefell ’s commitment to\nprovide same-sex couples “the constellation of benefits that the\nStates have linked to marriage,” id., at ___ (slip op., at\n17), we reverse the state court’s judgment. The petitioners here are two married same-sex\ncouples who conceived children through anonymous sperm donation.\nLeigh and Jana Jacobs were married in Iowa in 2010, and Terrah and\nMarisa Pavan were married in New Hampshire in 2011. Leigh and\nTerrah each gave birth to a child in Arkansas in 2015. When it came\ntime to secure birth certificates for the newborns, each couple\nfilled out paperwork listing both spouses as parents—Leigh and Jana\nin one case, Terrah and Marisa in the other. Both times, however,\nthe Arkansas Department of Health issued certificates bearing only\nthe birth mother’s name. The department’s decision rested on a provision\nof Arkansas law, Ark. Code §20–18–401 (2014), that specifies which\nindividuals will appear as parents on a child’s state-issued birth\ncertificate. “For the purposes of birth registration,” that statute\nsays, “the mother is deemed to be the woman who gives birth to the\nchild.” §20–18–401(e). And “[i]f the mother was married at the time\nof either conception or birth,” the statute instructs that “the\nname of [her] husband shall be entered on the certificate as the\nfather of the child.” §20–18–401(f)(1). There are some limited\nexceptions to the latter rule—for example, another man may appear\non the birth certificate if the “mother” and “husband” and\n“putative father” all file affidavits vouching for the putative\nfather’s paternity. Ibid. But as all parties agree, the\nrequirement that a married woman’s husband appear on her child’s\nbirth certificate applies in cases where the couple conceived by\nmeans of artificial insemination with the help of an anonymous\nsperm donor. See Pet. for Cert. 4; Brief in Opposition 3–4; see\nalso Ark.Code §9–10–201(a) (2015) (“Any child born to a married\nwoman by means of artificial insemination shall be deemed the\nlegitimate natural child of the woman and the woman’s husband if\nthe husband consents in writing to the artificial\ninsemination”). The Jacobses and Pavans brought this suit in\nArkansas state court against the director of the Arkansas\nDepartment of Health—seeking, among other things, a declaration\nthat the State’s birth-certificate law violates the Constitution.\nThe trial court agreed, holding that the relevant portions of\n§20–18–401 are inconsistent with Obergefell because they\n“categorically prohibi[t] every same-sex married couple\n. . . from enjoying the same spousal benefits which are\navailable to every opposite-sex married couple.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 59a. But a divided Arkansas Supreme Court reversed that\njudgment, concluding that the statute “pass[es] constitutional\nmuster.” 2016 Ark. 437, 505 S. W. 3d 169, 177. In that\ncourt’s view, “the statute centers on the relationship of the\nbiological mother and the biological father to the child, not on\nthe marital relationship of husband and wife,” and so it “does not\nrun afoul of Obergefell .” Id., at 178. Two justices\ndissented from that view, maintaining that under Obergefell “a same-sex married couple is entitled to a birth certificate on\nthe same basis as an opposite-sex marriedcouple.” 505\nS. W. 3d, at 184 (Brill, C. J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part); accord, id., at 190 (Danielson, J.,\ndissenting). The Arkansas Supreme Court’s decision, we\nconclude, denied married same-sex couples access to the\n“constellation of benefits that the Stat[e] ha[s] linked to\nmarriage.” Obergefell , 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n17). As already explained, when a married woman in Arkansas\nconceives a child by means of artificial insemination, the State\nwill—indeed, must —list the name of her male spouse on the\nchild’s birth certificate. See §20–18–401(f )(1); see also\n§9–10–201; supra, at 2. And yet state law, as interpreted by\nthe court below, allows Arkansas officials in those very same\ncircumstances to omit a married woman’s female spouse from her\nchild’s birth certificate. See 505 S. W. 3d, at 177–178.\nAs a result, same-sex parents in Arkansas lack the same right as\nopposite-sex parents to be listed on a child’s birth certificate, a\ndocument often used for important transactions like making medical\ndecisions for a child or enrolling a child in school. See Pet. for\nCert. 5–7 (listing situations in which a parent might be required\nto present a child’s birth certificate). Obergefell proscribes such disparate\ntreatment. As we explained there, a State may not “exclude\nsame-sexcouples from civil marriage on the same terms and\nconditions as opposite-sex couples.” 576 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 23). Indeed, in listing those terms and conditions—the\n“rights, benefits, and responsibilities” to which same-sex couples,\nno less than opposite-sex couples, must have access—we expressly\nidentified “birth and death certificates.” Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 17). That was no accident: Several of the plaintiffs in Obergefell challenged a State’s refusal to recognize their\nsame-sex spouses on their children’s birth certificates. See DeBoer v. Snyder , 772 F. 3d 388, 398–399 (CA6\n2014). In considering those challenges, we held the relevant state\nlaws unconstitutional to the extent they treated same-sex couples\ndifferently from opposite-sex couples. See 576 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 23). That holding applies with equal force to\n§20–18–401. Echoing the court below, the State defends its\nbirth-certificate law on the ground that being named on a child’s\nbirth certificate is not a benefit that attends marriage. Instead,\nthe State insists, a birth certificate is simply a device for\nrecording biological parentage—regardless of whether the child’s\nparents are married. But Arkansas law makes birth certificates\nabout more than just genetics. As already discussed, when an\nopposite-sex couple conceives a child by way of anonymous sperm\ndonation—just as the petitioners did here—state law requires the\nplacement of the birth mother’s husband on the child’s birth\ncertificate. See supra, at 2. And that is so even though (as\nthe State concedes) the husband “is definitively not the biological\nfather” in those circumstances. Brief in Opposition 4.[ 1 ]* Arkansas has thus chosen to make\nits birth certificates more than a mere marker of biological\nrelationships: The State uses those certificates to give married\nparents a form of legal recognition that is not available to\nunmarried parents. Having made that choice, Arkansas may not,\nconsistent with Obergefell , deny married same-sex couples\nthat recognition. The petition for a writ of certiorari and the\npending motions for leave to file briefs as amici curiae are\ngranted. The judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion. It is so ordered. Notes 1 * As the petitioners point\nout, other factual scenarios (beyond those present in this case)\nsimilarly show that the State’s birth certificates are about more\nthan genetic parentage. For example, when an Arkansas child is\nadopted, the State places the child’s original birth certificate\nunder seal and issues a new birth certificate—unidentifiable as an\namended version—listing the child’s (nonbiological) adoptive\nparents. See Ark. Code §§20–18–406(a)(1), (b) (2014); Ark. Admin.\nCode 007.12.1–5.5(a) (Apr. 2016).",

Two justices\ndissented from that view, maintaining that under Obergefell “a same-sex married couple is entitled to a birth certificate on\nthe same basis as an opposite-sex marriedcouple.” 505\nS. W. 3d, at 184 (Brill, C. J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part); accord, id., at 190 (Danielson, J.,\ndissenting). The Arkansas Supreme Court’s decision, we\nconclude, denied married same-sex couples access to the\n“constellation of benefits that the Stat[e] ha[s] linked to\nmarriage.” Obergefell , 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n17). As already explained, when a married woman in Arkansas\nconceives a child by means of artificial insemination, the State\nwill—indeed, must —list the name of her male spouse on the\nchild’s birth certificate. See §20–18–401(f )(1); see also\n§9–10–201; supra, at 2. And yet state law, as interpreted by\nthe court below, allows Arkansas officials in those very same\ncircumstances to omit a married woman’s female spouse from her\nchild’s birth certificate. See 505 S. W. 3d, at 177–178.\nAs a result, same-sex parents in Arkansas lack the same right as\nopposite-sex parents to be listed on a child’s birth certificate, a\ndocument often used for important transactions like making medical\ndecisions for a child or enrolling a child in school. See Pet. for\nCert. 5–7 (listing situations in which a parent might be required\nto present a child’s birth certificate). Obergefell proscribes such disparate\ntreatment. As we explained there, a State may not “exclude\nsame-sexcouples from civil marriage on the same terms and\nconditions as opposite-sex couples.” 576 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 23). Indeed, in listing those terms and conditions—the\n“rights, benefits, and responsibilities” to which same-sex couples,\nno less than opposite-sex couples, must have access—we expressly\nidentified “birth and death certificates.” Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 17). That was no accident: Several of the plaintiffs in Obergefell challenged a State’s refusal to recognize their\nsame-sex spouses on their children’s birth certificates. See DeBoer v. Snyder , 772 F. 3d 388, 398–399 (CA6\n2014). In considering those challenges, we held the relevant state\nlaws unconstitutional to the extent they treated same-sex couples\ndifferently from opposite-sex couples. See 576 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 23). That holding applies with equal force to\n§20–18–401. Echoing the court below, the State defends its\nbirth-certificate law on the ground that being named on a child’s\nbirth certificate is not a benefit that attends marriage. Instead,\nthe State insists, a birth certificate is simply a device for\nrecording biological parentage—regardless of whether the child’s\nparents are married. But Arkansas law makes birth certificates\nabout more than just genetics. As already discussed, when an\nopposite-sex couple conceives a child by way of anonymous sperm\ndonation—just as the petitioners did here—state law requires the\nplacement of the birth mother’s husband on the child’s birth\ncertificate. See supra, at 2. And that is so even though (as\nthe State concedes) the husband “is definitively not the biological\nfather” in those circumstances. Brief in Opposition 4.[ 1 ]* Arkansas has thus chosen to make\nits birth certificates more than a mere marker of biological\nrelationships: The State uses those certificates to give married\nparents a form of legal recognition that is not available to\nunmarried parents. Having made that choice, Arkansas may not,\nconsistent with Obergefell , deny married same-sex couples\nthat recognition. The petition for a writ of certiorari and the\npending motions for leave to file briefs as amici curiae are\ngranted. The judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court is reversed,\nand the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent\nwith this opinion. It is so ordered. Notes 1 * As the petitioners point\nout, other factual scenarios (beyond those present in this case)\nsimilarly show that the State’s birth certificates are about more\nthan genetic parentage. For example, when an Arkansas child is\nadopted, the State places the child’s original birth certificate\nunder seal and issues a new birth certificate—unidentifiable as an\namended version—listing the child’s (nonbiological) adoptive\nparents. See Ark. Code §§20–18–406(a)(1), (b) (2014); Ark. Admin.\nCode 007.12.1–5.5(a) (Apr. 2016).",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL v .\nMORALES-SANTANA certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit No. 15–1191. Argued November 9, 2016—Decided\nJune 12, 2017 The Immigration and Nationality Act provides\nthe framework for acquisition of U. S. citizenship from birth\nby a child born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen and\nthe other a citizen of another nation. Applicable to married\ncouples, the main rule in effect at the time here relevant, 8\nU. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), required the\nU. S.-citizen parent to have ten years’ physical presence in\nthe United States prior to the child’s birth, “at least five of\nwhich were after attaining” age 14. The rule is made applicable to\nunwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a), but §1409(c) creates\nan exception for an unwed U. S.-citizen mother, whose\ncitizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has\nlived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to\nthe child’s birth. Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana, who has\nlived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the U. S. citizenship of his\nbiological father, José Morales. José moved to the Dominican\nRepublic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave\nbirth to Morales-Santana. José accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household; he married\nMorales-Santana’s mother and his name was then added to hers on\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate. In 2000, the Government sought\nto remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions,\nranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did\nnot satisfy the requirement of five years’ physical presence after\nage 14. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s citizenship\nclaim and ordered his removal. Morales-Santana later moved to\nreopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government’s refusal to\nrecognize that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen\nfather violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. The\nBoard of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of\nthe equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based\nclassifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential\ntreatment of unwed mothers and fathers. To cure this infirmity, the\nCourt of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship\nthrough his father, just as he would were his mother the U. S.\ncitizen. Held : 1. The gender line Congress drew is\nincompatible with the Fifth Amendment’s requirement that the\nGovernment accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Pp. 6–23. (a) Morales-Santana satisfies the\nrequirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his\nfather’s right to equal protection. José Morales’ ability to pass\ncitizenship to his son easily satisfies the requirement that the\nthird party have a “ ‘close’ relationship with the person who\npossesses the right.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543\nU. S. 125 . And José’s death many years before the current\ncontroversy arose is “a ‘hindrance’ to [José’s] ability to protect\nhis own interests.” Ibid. Pp. 6–7. (b) Sections 1401 and 1409 date from an\nera when the Nation’s lawbooks were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. Today, such laws\nreceive the heightened scrutiny that now attends “all gender-based\nclassifications,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.\nT. B. , 511 U. S. 127 , including laws granting or denying\nbenefits “on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,” Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76 . Prescribing\none rule for mothers, another for fathers, §1409 is of the same\ngenre as the classifications declared unconstitutional in Westcott ; Reed v. Reed , 404 U. S. 71 –77; Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S. 636 –653;\nand Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207. A\nsuccessful defense therefore requires an “ ‘exceedingly\npersuasive justification.’ ” United States v. Virginia , 518 U. S. 515 . Pp. 7–9. (c) The Government must show, at least,\nthat its gender-based “ ‘classification serves “important\ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed”\nare “substantially related to [achieving] those\nobjectives.” ’ ” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533.\nThe classification must serve an important governmental interest today , for “new insights and societal understandings can\nreveal unjustified inequality . . . that once passed\nunnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges ,\n576 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 9–14. (1) At the time §1409 was enacted as part\nof the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), two once habitual, but\nnow untenable, assumptions pervaded the Nation’s citizenship laws\nand underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage,\nhusband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the sole\nguardian of a nonmarital child. In the 1940 Act, Congress codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.\nAccording to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified\nfor unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have\nscant contact with, their nonmarital children. Unwed citizen\nmothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father,\nalong with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.\nPp. 9–13. (2) For close to a half century, this\nCourt has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on “overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533. No “important [governmental] interest” is served by laws\ngrounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that\n“unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than\nmothers” to take responsibility for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441 U. S. 380 . In light of\nthis equal protection jurisprudence, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are\nanachronistic. Pp. 13–14. (d) The Government points to Fiallo v. Bell , 430 U. S. 787 ; Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53 , for support. But Fiallo involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not\npresent a claim of U. S. citizenship. And Miller and Nguyen addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well\nmet here, not the length of a parent’s prebirth residency in the\nUnited States. Pp. 14–16. (e) The Government’s suggested rationales\nfor §1409(a) and (c)’s gender-based differential do not survive\nheightened scrutiny. Pp. 16–23. (1) The Government asserts that Congress\nsought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection\nto the United States. The statute, the Government suggests,\nbracketed an unwed U. S.-citizen mother with a married couple\nin which both parents are U. S. citizens because she is the\nonly legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed\nU. S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a\ncitizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national\ninfluence of the alien mother. This rationale conforms to the\nlong-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.\nAnd the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested\ncongressional interest. Citizenship may be transmitted to children\nwho have no tie to the United States so long as their\nU. S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United\nStates for one year at any point in her life prior to the\nchild’s birth; but it may not be transmitted by a\nU. S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting\n§1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he\nacknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the\nchild in the United States. Pp. 17–19. (2) The Government also maintains that\nCongress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the\nforeign-born child of a U. S. citizen. But congressional\nhearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a\nstatelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence\nrequirements. Nor has the Government shown that the risk of\nstatelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Pp. 19–23. 2. Because this Court is not equipped to\nconvert §1409(c)’s exception for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers\ninto the main rule displacing §§1401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to\nCongress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor\ndisadvantages any person on the basis of gender. In the interim,\n§1401(a)(7)’s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to\nchildren born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. The\nlegislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs\nthe choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending\nfavorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable\ntreatment from the favored class. Ordinarily, the preferred rule is\nto extend favorable treatment. Westcott , 443 U. S., at\n89–90. Here, however, extension to fathers of §1409(c)’s favorable\ntreatment for mothers would displace Congress’ general rule, the\nlonger physical-presence requirements of §§1401(a)(7) and 1409\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers and\nU. S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the\nchild’s alien parent. Congress’ “ ‘commitment to th[is]\nresidual policy’ ” and “ ‘the degree of potential\ndisruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as\nopposed to abrogation,’ ” Heckler v. Mathews ,\n465 U. S. 728 , n. 5, indicate that Congress would likely\nhave abrogated §1409(c)’s special exception, preferring to preserve\n“the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of\ndedicated attachment,” Rogers v. Bellei , 401\nU. S. 815 . Pp. 23–28. 804 F. 3d 520, affirmed in part, reversed\nin part, and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed an opinion\nconcurring in the judgment in part, in which Alito, J., joined.\nGorsuch, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the\ncase.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1191 _________________ JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [June 12, 2017] Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case concerns a gender-based differential\nin the law governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a\nchild born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the\nother, a citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in\n8 U. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g)\n(2012 ed.). Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires a\nperiod of physical presence in the United States for the\nU. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially\nprescribed, was ten years’ physical presence prior to the child’s\nbirth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years\nprebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule is rendered\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a).\nCongress ordered an exception, however, for unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c), the exception\nallows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born\nabroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year\nprior to the child’s birth. The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón\nMorales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father\nwas just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)’s physical-presence\nrequirement. Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic,\nMorales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle\nimplicit in the Fifth Amendment[ 1 ] entitles him to citizenship stature. We hold that the\ngender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that\nthe Government accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Nevertheless, we cannot convert §1409(c)’s exception for\nunwed mothers into the main rule displacing §1401(a)(7) (covering\nmarried couples) and §1409(a) (covering unwed fathers). We must\ntherefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a\nphysical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other\nperiod) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one\nU. S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed. In the\ninterim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are\nadministered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination. I A We first describe in greater detail the regime\nCongress constructed. The general rules for acquiring U. S.\ncitizenship are found in 8 U. S. C. §1401, the first\nsection in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (1952 Act or INA), §301, 66Stat. 235–236. Section\n1401 sets forth the INA’s rules for determining who “shall be\nnationals and citizens of the United States at birth” by\nestablishing a range of residency and physical-presence\nrequirements calibrated primarily to the parents’ nationality and\nthe child’s place of birth. §1401(a) (1958 ed.); §1401 (2012 ed.).\nThe primacy of §1401 in the statutory scheme is evident.\nComprehensive in coverage, §1401 provides the general framework for\nthe acquisition of citizenship at birth. In particular, at the time\nrelevant here,[ 2 ] §1401(a)(7)\nprovided for the U. S. citizenship of “a person born outside the geographical\nlimits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents\none of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United\nStates who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically\npresent in the United States or its outlying possessions for a\nperiod or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five\nof which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided , That any periods of honorable service in the Armed\nForces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included\nin computing the physical presence requirements of this\nparagraph.” Congress has since reduced the duration\nrequirement to five years, two after age 14. §1401(g) (2012\ned.).[ 3 ] Section 1409 pertains specifically to children\nwith unmarried parents. Its first subsection, §1409(a),\nincorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of\n§1401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to\ntransmit U. S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the\nsame terms as a married citizen parent. Section 1409(c)—a provision\napplicable only to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers—states an\nexception to the physical-presence requirements of §§1401 and\n1409(a). Under §1409(c)’s exception, only one year of continuous\nphysical presence is required before unwed mothers may pass\ncitizenship to their children born abroad. B Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana moved to\nthe United States at age 13, and has resided in this country most\nof his life. Now facing deportation, he asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biological\nfather, José Morales, who accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household. José Morales was born in Guánica, Puerto Rico,\non March 19, 1900. Record 55–56. Puerto Rico was then, as it is\nnow, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle , 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 2–4); 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (“The term\nUnited States . . . means the continental United States,\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U. S.] Virgin\nIslands.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); §1101(a)(38) (2012\ned.) (similar), and José became a U. S. citizen under the\nOrganic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, §5, 39Stat. 953 (a predecessor\nto 8 U. S. C. §1402). After living in Puerto Rico for\nnearly two decades, José left his childhood home on February 27,\n1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. Record 57, 66. He did so to take up employment as a\nbuilder-mechanic for a U. S. company in the\nthen-U. S.-occupied Dominican Republic. Ibid. [ 4 ] By 1959, José attested in a June 21, 1971\naffidavit presented to the U. S. Embassy in the Dominican\nRepublic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Dominican\nwoman he would eventually marry. Id. , at 57. In 1962, Yrma\ngave birth to their child, respondent Luis Morales-Santana. Id. , at 166–167. While the record before us reveals little\nabout Morales-Santana’s childhood, the Dominican archives disclose\nthat Yrma and José married in 1970, and that José was then added to\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate as his father. Id. , at\n163–164, 167. José also related in the same affidavit that he was\nthen saving money “for the susten[ance] of [his] family” in\nanticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where members of\nhis family still resided. Id. , at 57. In 1975, when\nMorales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico, id. , at\n368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was attending public\nschool in the Bronx, a New York City borough, id. , at 140,\n369.[ 5 ] C In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana\nin removal proceedings based on several convictions for offenses\nunder New York State Penal Law, all of them rendered on May 17,\n1995. Id. , at 426. Morales-Santana ranked as an alien\ndespite the many years he lived in the United States, because, at\nthe time of his birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement\nof five years’ physical presence after age 14. See supra , at\n3–4, and n. 3. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s\nclaim to citizenship derived from the U. S. citizenship of his\nfather, and ordered Morales-Santana’s removal to the Dominican\nRepublic. Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a–49a. In 2010,\nMorales-Santana moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the\nGovernment’s refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from\nhis U. S.-citizen father violated the Constitution’s equal\nprotection guarantee. See Record 27, 45. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) denied the motion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a,\n42a–44a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the BIA’s decision. 804 F. 3d 520, 524\n(2015). Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of the equal\nprotection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications,\nthe court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed\nmothers and fathers. Id. , at 527–535. To cure the\nconstitutional flaw, the court further held that Morales-Santana\nderived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his\nmother the U. S. citizen. Id. , at 535–538. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit declined to follow the conflicting\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Flores-Villar , 536 F. 3d 990 (2008), see 804\nF. 3d, at 530, 535, n. 17. We granted certiorariin Flores-Villar , but ultimately affirmed by an equally divided\nCourt. Flores-Villar v. United States , 564 U. S.\n210 (2011) ( per curiam ). Taking up Morales-Santana’s\nrequest for review, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), we consider the\nmatter anew. II Because §1409 treats sons and daughters alike,\nMorales-Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based\ndiscrimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of\nMorales-Santana’s birth and was not accorded the right an unwed\nU. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her\nchild. Although the Government does not contend otherwise, we\nbriefly explain why Morales-Santana may seek to vindicate his\nfather’s right to the equal protection of the laws.[ 6 ] Ordinarily, a party “must assert his own legal\nrights” and “cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights\n. . . of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin ,\n422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975) . But we recognize an exception\nwhere, as here, “the party asserting the right has a close\nrelationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is\na hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his own\ninterests.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125,\n130 (2004) (quoting Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S.\n400, 411 (1991) ). José Morales’ ability to pass citizenship to his\nson, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies the “close\nrelationship” requirement. So, too, is the “hindrance” requirement\nwell met. José Morales’ failure to assert a claim in his own right\n“stems from disability,” not “disinterest,” Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420, 450 (1998) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), for José died in 1976, Record 140, many\nyears before the current controversy arose. See Hodel v. Irving , 481 U. S. 704 –712, 723, n. 7 (1987)\n(children and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights of\ndeceased relatives). Morales-Santana is thus the “obvious\nclaimant,” see Craig v. Boren , 429 U. S. 190,\n197 (1976) , the “best available proponent,” Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U. S. 106, 116 (1976) , of his father’s\nright to equal protection. III Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an\nera when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. See, e.g. , Hoyt v. Florida , 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961) (women\nare the “center of home and family life,” therefore they can be\n“relieved from the civic duty of jury service”); Goesaert v. Cleary , 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (States may draw “a\nsharp line between the sexes”). Today, laws of this kind are\nsubject to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends\n“all gender-based classifications.” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127, 136 (1994) ; see, e.g. , United States v. Virginia , 518\nU. S. 515 –556 (1996) (state-maintained military academy may\nnot deny admission to qualified women). Laws granting or denying benefits “on the basis\nof the sex of the qualifying parent,” our post-1970 decisions\naffirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore attract\nheightened review under the Constitution’s equal protection\nguarantee. Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76,\n84 (1979) ; see id. , at 88–89 (holding unconstitutional\nprovision of unemployed-parent benefits exclusively to fathers).\nAccord Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207\n(1977) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that denied widowers survivors’ benefits\navailable to widows); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420\nU. S. 636 –653 (1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that excluded fathers from receipt of\nchild-in-care benefits available to mothers); Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691 (1973) (plurality\nopinion) (holding unconstitutional exclusion of married female\nofficers in the military from benefits automatically accorded\nmarried male officers); cf. Reed v. Reed , 404\nU. S. 71 –77 (1971) (holding unconstitutional a probate-code\npreference for a father over a mother as administrator of a\ndeceased child’s estate).[ 7 ] Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for\nfathers, §1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we\ndeclared unconstitutional in Reed , Frontiero , Wiesenfeld , Goldfarb , and Westcott . As in\nthose cases, heightened scrutiny is in order. Successful defense of\nlegislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have\nreiterated, requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Kirchberg v. Feenstra , 450 U. S. 455,\n461 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). A The defender of legislation that\ndifferentiates on the basis of gender must show “at least that the\n[challenged] classification serves important governmental\nobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533 (quoting Mississippi\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan , 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982)\n; alteration in original); see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53, 60, 70 (2001) . Moreover, the\nclassification must substantially serve an important governmental\ninterest today , for “in interpreting the [e]qual\n[p]rotection [guarantee], [we have] recognized that new insights\nand societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality\n. . . that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 20). Here, the Government has supplied no\n“exceedingly persuasive justification,” Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted), for §1409(a)\nand (c)’s “gender-based” and “gender-biased” disparity, Westcott , 443 U. S., at 84 (internalquotation marks\nomitted). 1 History reveals what lurks behind §1409.\nEnacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54Stat.\n1139–1140, §1409 ended a century and a half of congressional\nsilence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed\nparents.[ 8 ] During this era,\ntwo once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our\nNation’s citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and\nadministrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife\nsubordinate; unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a\nnonmarital child. Under the once entrenched principle of male\ndominance in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.\n“[D]ominance [of] the husband,” this Court observed in 1915, “is an\nancient principle of our jurisprudence.” Mackenzie v. Hare , 239 U. S. 299, 311 (1915) .[ 9 ] See generally Brief for Professors of History\net al. as Amici Curiae 4–15. Through the early 20th\ncentury, a male citizen automatically conferred U. S.\ncitizenship on his alien wife. Act of Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, §2,\n10Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen , 7 Wall. 496, 498\n(1869) (the 1855 Act “confers the privileges of citizenship upon\nwomen married to citizens of the United States”); C. Bredbenner, A\nNationality of Her Own:Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship\n15–16, 20–21 (1998). A female citizen, however, was incapable of\nconferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was subject to\nexpatriation if she married an alien.[ 10 ] The family of a citizen or a lawfully admitted\npermanent resident enjoyed statutory exemptions from entry\nrequirements, but only if the citizen or resident was male. See, e.g. , Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §37, 32Stat. 1221\n(wives and children entering the country to join permanent-resident\naliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases during\ntransit shall not be deported if the diseases were easily curable\nor did not present a danger to others); S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st\nCong., 2d Sess., 415–417 (1950) (wives exempt from literacy and\nquota requirements). And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born\nchild of a married couple gained U. S. citizenship only\nthrough the father.[ 11 ] For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition\nnever held sway. Instead, the mother was regarded as the child’s\nnatural and sole guardian. At common law, the mother, and only the\nmother, was “bound to maintain [a nonmarital child] as its natural\nguardian.” 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *215–*216 (8th\ned. 1854); see Nguyen , 533 U. S., at 91–92 (O’Connor,\nJ., dissenting). In line with that understanding, in the early 20th\ncentury, the State Department sometimes permitted unwed mothers to\npass citizenship to their children, despite the absence of any\nstatutory authority for the practice. See Hearings on H. R.\n6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization,\n76th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings);\n39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 397–398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291\n(1939). See also Collins, Illegitimate Borders: Jus\nSanguinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family,\nRace, and Nation, 123 Yale L. J. 2134, 2199–2205 (2014)\n(hereinafter Collins). In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the\nfather-controls assumption concerning married parents, but codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried parents.\nThe Roosevelt administration, which proposed §1409, explained:\n“[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child] stands in the place of the\nfather . . . [,] has a right tothe custody and control of\nsuch a child as against the putative father, and is bound to\nmaintain it as its natu-ral guardian.” 1940 Hearings 431 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion\nrenders §1409’s gender-based residency rules understandable.\nFearing that a foreign-born child could turn out “more alien than\nAmerican in character,” the administration believed that a citizen\nparent with lengthy ties to the United States would counteract the\ninfluence of the alien parent. Id. , at 426–427. Concern\nabout the attachment of foreign-born children to the United States\nexplains the treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to\nthe familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have scant\ncontact with, their nonmarital children. For unwed citizen mothers,\nhowever, there was no need for a prolonged residency prophylactic:\nThe alien father, who might transmit foreign ways, was\npresumptively out of the picture. See id. , at 431; Collins\n2203 (in “nearly uniform view” of U. S. officials, “almost\ninvariably,” the mother alone “concern[ed] herself with [a\nnonmarital] child” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 2 For close to a half century, as earlier\nobserved, see supra , at 7–8, this Court has viewed with\nsuspicion laws that rely on “overbroad generalizations about the\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and\nfemales.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S., at 643, 648. In particular, we\nhave recognized that if a “statutory objective is to exclude or\n‘protect’ members of one gender” in reliance on “fixed notions\nconcerning [that gender’s] roles and abilities,” the “objective\nitself is illegitimate.” Mississippi Univ. for Women , 458\nU. S., at 725. In accord with this eventual understanding, the\nCourt has held that no “important [governmental] interest” is\nserved by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the\nobsolescing view that “unwed fathers [are] invariably less\nqualified and entitled than mothers” to take responsibility for\nnonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441\nU. S. 380, 382, 394 (1979) .[ 12 ] Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court\nhas come to comprehend, have a constraining impact, descriptive\nthough they may be of the way many people still order their\nlives.[ 13 ] Laws according or\ndenying benefits in reliance on “[s]tereotypes about women’s\ndomestic roles,” the Court has observed, may “creat[e] a\nself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that force[s] women to\ncontinue to assume the role of primary family caregiver.” Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721,\n736 (2003) . Correspondingly, such laws may disserve men who\nexercise responsibility for raising their children. See ibid. In light of the equal protection jurisprudence this\nCourt has developed since 1971, see Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531–534, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers\nwho have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly\nanachronistic. B In urging this Court nevertheless to reject\nMorales-Santana’s equal protection plea, the Government cites three\ndecisions of this Court: Fiallo v. Bell , 430\nU. S. 787 (1977) ; Miller v. Albright , 523\nU. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53\n. None controls this case. The 1952 Act provision at issue in Fiallo gave special immigration preferences to alien children of citizen\n(or lawful-permanent-resident) mothers, and to alien unwed mothers\nof citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children. 430 U. S.,\nat 788–789, and n. 1. Unwed fathers and their children,\nasserting their right to equal protection, sought the same\npreferences. Id. , at 791. Applying minimal scrutiny\n(rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on\nCongress’ “exceptionally broad power” to admit or exclude aliens. Id. , at 792, 794.[ 14 ]\nThis case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.\nMorales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a\nU. S. citizen. Examining a claim of that order, the Court has\nnot disclaimed, as it did in Fiallo , the application of an\nexacting standard of review. See Nguyen , 533 U. S., at\n60–61, 70; Miller , 523 U. S., at 434–435, n. ",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL v .\nMORALES-SANTANA certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit No. 15–1191. Argued November 9, 2016—Decided\nJune 12, 2017 The Immigration and Nationality Act provides\nthe framework for acquisition of U. S. citizenship from birth\nby a child born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen and\nthe other a citizen of another nation. Applicable to married\ncouples, the main rule in effect at the time here relevant, 8\nU. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), required the\nU. S.-citizen parent to have ten years’ physical presence in\nthe United States prior to the child’s birth, “at least five of\nwhich were after attaining” age 14. The rule is made applicable to\nunwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a), but §1409(c) creates\nan exception for an unwed U. S.-citizen mother, whose\ncitizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has\nlived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to\nthe child’s birth. Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana, who has\nlived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the U. S. citizenship of his\nbiological father, José Morales. José moved to the Dominican\nRepublic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave\nbirth to Morales-Santana. José accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household; he married\nMorales-Santana’s mother and his name was then added to hers on\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate. In 2000, the Government sought\nto remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions,\nranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did\nnot satisfy the requirement of five years’ physical presence after\nage 14. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s citizenship\nclaim and ordered his removal. Morales-Santana later moved to\nreopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government’s refusal to\nrecognize that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen\nfather violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. The\nBoard of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of\nthe equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based\nclassifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential\ntreatment of unwed mothers and fathers. To cure this infirmity, the\nCourt of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship\nthrough his father, just as he would were his mother the U. S.\ncitizen. Held : 1. The gender line Congress drew is\nincompatible with the Fifth Amendment’s requirement that the\nGovernment accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Pp. 6–23. (a) Morales-Santana satisfies the\nrequirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his\nfather’s right to equal protection. José Morales’ ability to pass\ncitizenship to his son easily satisfies the requirement that the\nthird party have a “ ‘close’ relationship with the person who\npossesses the right.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543\nU. S. 125 . And José’s death many years before the current\ncontroversy arose is “a ‘hindrance’ to [José’s] ability to protect\nhis own interests.” Ibid. Pp. 6–7. (b) Sections 1401 and 1409 date from an\nera when the Nation’s lawbooks were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. Today, such laws\nreceive the heightened scrutiny that now attends “all gender-based\nclassifications,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.\nT. B. , 511 U. S. 127 , including laws granting or denying\nbenefits “on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,” Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76 . Prescribing\none rule for mothers, another for fathers, §1409 is of the same\ngenre as the classifications declared unconstitutional in Westcott ; Reed v. Reed , 404 U. S. 71 –77; Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S. 636 –653;\nand Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207. A\nsuccessful defense therefore requires an “ ‘exceedingly\npersuasive justification.’ ” United States v. Virginia , 518 U. S. 515 . Pp. 7–9. (c) The Government must show, at least,\nthat its gender-based “ ‘classification serves “important\ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed”\nare “substantially related to [achieving] those\nobjectives.” ’ ” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533.\nThe classification must serve an important governmental interest today , for “new insights and societal understandings can\nreveal unjustified inequality . . . that once passed\nunnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges ,\n576 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 9–14. (1) At the time §1409 was enacted as part\nof the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), two once habitual, but\nnow untenable, assumptions pervaded the Nation’s citizenship laws\nand underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage,\nhusband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the sole\nguardian of a nonmarital child. In the 1940 Act, Congress codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.\nAccording to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified\nfor unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have\nscant contact with, their nonmarital children. Unwed citizen\nmothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father,\nalong with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.\nPp. 9–13. (2) For close to a half century, this\nCourt has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on “overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533. No “important [governmental] interest” is served by laws\ngrounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that\n“unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than\nmothers” to take responsibility for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441 U. S. 380 . In light of\nthis equal protection jurisprudence, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are\nanachronistic. Pp. 13–14. (d) The Government points to Fiallo v. Bell , 430 U. S. 787 ; Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53 , for support. But Fiallo involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not\npresent a claim of U. S. citizenship. And Miller and Nguyen addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well\nmet here, not the length of a parent’s prebirth residency in the\nUnited States. Pp. 14–16. (e) The Government’s suggested rationales\nfor §1409(a) and (c)’s gender-based differential do not survive\nheightened scrutiny. Pp. 16–23. (1) The Government asserts that Congress\nsought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection\nto the United States. The statute, the Government suggests,\nbracketed an unwed U. S.-citizen mother with a married couple\nin which both parents are U. S. citizens because she is the\nonly legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed\nU. S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a\ncitizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national\ninfluence of the alien mother. This rationale conforms to the\nlong-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.\nAnd the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested\ncongressional interest. Citizenship may be transmitted to children\nwho have no tie to the United States so long as their\nU. S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United\nStates for one year at any point in her life prior to the\nchild’s birth; but it may not be transmitted by a\nU. S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting\n§1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he\nacknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the\nchild in the United States. Pp. 17–19. (2) The Government also maintains that\nCongress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the\nforeign-born child of a U. S. citizen. But congressional\nhearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a\nstatelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence\nrequirements. Nor has the Government shown that the risk of\nstatelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Pp. 19–23. 2. Because this Court is not equipped to\nconvert §1409(c)’s exception for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers\ninto the main rule displacing §§1401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to\nCongress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor\ndisadvantages any person on the basis of gender. In the interim,\n§1401(a)(7)’s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to\nchildren born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. The\nlegislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs\nthe choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending\nfavorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable\ntreatment from the favored class. Ordinarily, the preferred rule is\nto extend favorable treatment. Westcott , 443 U. S., at\n89–90. Here, however, extension to fathers of §1409(c)’s favorable\ntreatment for mothers would displace Congress’ general rule, the\nlonger physical-presence requirements of §§1401(a)(7) and 1409\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers and\nU. S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the\nchild’s alien parent. Congress’ “ ‘commitment to th[is]\nresidual policy’ ” and “ ‘the degree of potential\ndisruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as\nopposed to abrogation,’ ” Heckler v. Mathews ,\n465 U. S. 728 , n. 5, indicate that Congress would likely\nhave abrogated §1409(c)’s special exception, preferring to preserve\n“the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of\ndedicated attachment,” Rogers v. Bellei , 401\nU. S. 815 . Pp. 23–28. 804 F. 3d 520, affirmed in part, reversed\nin part, and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed an opinion\nconcurring in the judgment in part, in which Alito, J., joined.\nGorsuch, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the\ncase.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1191 _________________ JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [June 12, 2017] Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case concerns a gender-based differential\nin the law governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a\nchild born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the\nother, a citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in\n8 U. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g)\n(2012 ed.). Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires a\nperiod of physical presence in the United States for the\nU. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially\nprescribed, was ten years’ physical presence prior to the child’s\nbirth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years\nprebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule is rendered\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a).\nCongress ordered an exception, however, for unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c), the exception\nallows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born\nabroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year\nprior to the child’s birth. The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón\nMorales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father\nwas just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)’s physical-presence\nrequirement. Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic,\nMorales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle\nimplicit in the Fifth Amendment[ 1 ] entitles him to citizenship stature. We hold that the\ngender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that\nthe Government accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Nevertheless, we cannot convert §1409(c)’s exception for\nunwed mothers into the main rule displacing §1401(a)(7) (covering\nmarried couples) and §1409(a) (covering unwed fathers). We must\ntherefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a\nphysical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other\nperiod) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one\nU. S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed. In the\ninterim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are\nadministered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination. I A We first describe in greater detail the regime\nCongress constructed. The general rules for acquiring U. S.\ncitizenship are found in 8 U. S. C. §1401, the first\nsection in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (1952 Act or INA), §301, 66Stat. 235–236. Section\n1401 sets forth the INA’s rules for determining who “shall be\nnationals and citizens of the United States at birth” by\nestablishing a range of residency and physical-presence\nrequirements calibrated primarily to the parents’ nationality and\nthe child’s place of birth. §1401(a) (1958 ed.); §1401 (2012 ed.).\nThe primacy of §1401 in the statutory scheme is evident.\nComprehensive in coverage, §1401 provides the general framework for\nthe acquisition of citizenship at birth. In particular, at the time\nrelevant here,[ 2 ] §1401(a)(7)\nprovided for the U. S. citizenship of “a person born outside the geographical\nlimits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents\none of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United\nStates who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically\npresent in the United States or its outlying possessions for a\nperiod or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five\nof which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided , That any periods of honorable service in the Armed\nForces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included\nin computing the physical presence requirements of this\nparagraph.” Congress has since reduced the duration\nrequirement to five years, two after age 14. §1401(g) (2012\ned.).[ 3 ] Section 1409 pertains specifically to children\nwith unmarried parents. Its first subsection, §1409(a),\nincorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of\n§1401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to\ntransmit U. S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the\nsame terms as a married citizen parent. Section 1409(c)—a provision\napplicable only to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers—states an\nexception to the physical-presence requirements of §§1401 and\n1409(a). Under §1409(c)’s exception, only one year of continuous\nphysical presence is required before unwed mothers may pass\ncitizenship to their children born abroad. B Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana moved to\nthe United States at age 13, and has resided in this country most\nof his life. Now facing deportation, he asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biological\nfather, José Morales, who accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household. José Morales was born in Guánica, Puerto Rico,\non March 19, 1900. Record 55–56. Puerto Rico was then, as it is\nnow, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle , 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 2–4); 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (“The term\nUnited States . . . means the continental United States,\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U. S.] Virgin\nIslands.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); §1101(a)(38) (2012\ned.) (similar), and José became a U. S. citizen under the\nOrganic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, §5, 39Stat. 953 (a predecessor\nto 8 U. S. C. §1402). After living in Puerto Rico for\nnearly two decades, José left his childhood home on February 27,\n1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. Record 57, 66. He did so to take up employment as a\nbuilder-mechanic for a U. S. company in the\nthen-U. S.-occupied Dominican Republic. Ibid. [ 4 ] By 1959, José attested in a June 21, 1971\naffidavit presented to the U. S. Embassy in the Dominican\nRepublic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Dominican\nwoman he would eventually marry. Id. , at 57. In 1962, Yrma\ngave birth to their child, respondent Luis Morales-Santana. Id. , at 166–167. While the record before us reveals little\nabout Morales-Santana’s childhood, the Dominican archives disclose\nthat Yrma and José married in 1970, and that José was then added to\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate as his father. Id. , at\n163–164, 167. José also related in the same affidavit that he was\nthen saving money “for the susten[ance] of [his] family” in\nanticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where members of\nhis family still resided. Id. , at 57. In 1975, when\nMorales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico, id. , at\n368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was attending public\nschool in the Bronx, a New York City borough, id. , at 140,\n369.[ 5 ] C In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana\nin removal proceedings based on several convictions for offenses\nunder New York State Penal Law, all of them rendered on May 17,\n1995. Id. , at 426. Morales-Santana ranked as an alien\ndespite the many years he lived in the United States, because, at\nthe time of his birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement\nof five years’ physical presence after age 14. See supra , at\n3–4, and n. 3. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s\nclaim to citizenship derived from the U. S. citizenship of his\nfather, and ordered Morales-Santana’s removal to the Dominican\nRepublic. Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a–49a. In 2010,\nMorales-Santana moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the\nGovernment’s refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from\nhis U. S.-citizen father violated the Constitution’s equal\nprotection guarantee. See Record 27, 45. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) denied the motion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a,\n42a–44a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the BIA’s decision. 804 F. 3d 520, 524\n(2015). Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of the equal\nprotection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications,\nthe court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed\nmothers and fathers. Id. , at 527–535. To cure the\nconstitutional flaw, the court further held that Morales-Santana\nderived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his\nmother the U. S. citizen. Id. , at 535–538. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit declined to follow the conflicting\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Flores-Villar , 536 F. 3d 990 (2008), see 804\nF. 3d, at 530, 535, n. 17. We granted certiorariin Flores-Villar , but ultimately affirmed by an equally divided\nCourt. Flores-Villar v. United States , 564 U. S.\n210 (2011) ( per curiam ). Taking up Morales-Santana’s\nrequest for review, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), we consider the\nmatter anew. II Because §1409 treats sons and daughters alike,\nMorales-Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based\ndiscrimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of\nMorales-Santana’s birth and was not accorded the right an unwed\nU. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her\nchild. Although the Government does not contend otherwise, we\nbriefly explain why Morales-Santana may seek to vindicate his\nfather’s right to the equal protection of the laws.[ 6 ] Ordinarily, a party “must assert his own legal\nrights” and “cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights\n. . . of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin ,\n422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975) . But we recognize an exception\nwhere, as here, “the party asserting the right has a close\nrelationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is\na hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his own\ninterests.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125,\n130 (2004) (quoting Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S.\n400, 411 (1991) ). José Morales’ ability to pass citizenship to his\nson, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies the “close\nrelationship” requirement. So, too, is the “hindrance” requirement\nwell met. José Morales’ failure to assert a claim in his own right\n“stems from disability,” not “disinterest,” Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420, 450 (1998) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), for José died in 1976, Record 140, many\nyears before the current controversy arose. See Hodel v. Irving , 481 U. S. 704 –712, 723, n. 7 (1987)\n(children and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights of\ndeceased relatives). Morales-Santana is thus the “obvious\nclaimant,” see Craig v. Boren , 429 U. S. 190,\n197 (1976) , the “best available proponent,” Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U. S. 106, 116 (1976) , of his father’s\nright to equal protection. III Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an\nera when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. See, e.g. , Hoyt v. Florida , 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961) (women\nare the “center of home and family life,” therefore they can be\n“relieved from the civic duty of jury service”); Goesaert v. Cleary , 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (States may draw “a\nsharp line between the sexes”). Today, laws of this kind are\nsubject to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends\n“all gender-based classifications.” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127, 136 (1994) ; see, e.g. , United States v. Virginia , 518\nU. S. 515 –556 (1996) (state-maintained military academy may\nnot deny admission to qualified women). Laws granting or denying benefits “on the basis\nof the sex of the qualifying parent,” our post-1970 decisions\naffirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore attract\nheightened review under the Constitution’s equal protection\nguarantee. Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76,\n84 (1979) ; see id. , at 88–89 (holding unconstitutional\nprovision of unemployed-parent benefits exclusively to fathers).\nAccord Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207\n(1977) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that denied widowers survivors’ benefits\navailable to widows); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420\nU. S. 636 –653 (1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that excluded fathers from receipt of\nchild-in-care benefits available to mothers); Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691 (1973) (plurality\nopinion) (holding unconstitutional exclusion of married female\nofficers in the military from benefits automatically accorded\nmarried male officers); cf. Reed v. Reed , 404\nU. S. 71 –77 (1971) (holding unconstitutional a probate-code\npreference for a father over a mother as administrator of a\ndeceased child’s estate).[ 7 ] Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for\nfathers, §1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we\ndeclared unconstitutional in Reed , Frontiero , Wiesenfeld , Goldfarb , and Westcott . As in\nthose cases, heightened scrutiny is in order. Successful defense of\nlegislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have\nreiterated, requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Kirchberg v. Feenstra , 450 U. S. 455,\n461 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). A The defender of legislation that\ndifferentiates on the basis of gender must show “at least that the\n[challenged] classification serves important governmental\nobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533 (quoting Mississippi\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan , 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982)\n; alteration in original); see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53, 60, 70 (2001) . Moreover, the\nclassification must substantially serve an important governmental\ninterest today , for “in interpreting the [e]qual\n[p]rotection [guarantee], [we have] recognized that new insights\nand societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality\n. . . that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 20). Here, the Government has supplied no\n“exceedingly persuasive justification,” Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted), for §1409(a)\nand (c)’s “gender-based” and “gender-biased” disparity, Westcott , 443 U. S., at 84 (internalquotation marks\nomitted). 1 History reveals what lurks behind §1409.\nEnacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54Stat.\n1139–1140, §1409 ended a century and a half of congressional\nsilence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed\nparents.[ 8 ] During this era,\ntwo once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our\nNation’s citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and\nadministrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife\nsubordinate; unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a\nnonmarital child. Under the once entrenched principle of male\ndominance in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.\n“[D]ominance [of] the husband,” this Court observed in 1915, “is an\nancient principle of our jurisprudence.” Mackenzie v. Hare , 239 U. S. 299, 311 (1915) .[ 9 ] See generally Brief for Professors of History\net al. as Amici Curiae 4–15. Through the early 20th\ncentury, a male citizen automatically conferred U. S.\ncitizenship on his alien wife. Act of Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, §2,\n10Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen , 7 Wall. 496, 498\n(1869) (the 1855 Act “confers the privileges of citizenship upon\nwomen married to citizens of the United States”); C. Bredbenner, A\nNationality of Her Own:Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship\n15–16, 20–21 (1998). A female citizen, however, was incapable of\nconferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was subject to\nexpatriation if she married an alien.[ 10 ] The family of a citizen or a lawfully admitted\npermanent resident enjoyed statutory exemptions from entry\nrequirements, but only if the citizen or resident was male. See, e.g. , Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §37, 32Stat. 1221\n(wives and children entering the country to join permanent-resident\naliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases during\ntransit shall not be deported if the diseases were easily curable\nor did not present a danger to others); S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st\nCong., 2d Sess., 415–417 (1950) (wives exempt from literacy and\nquota requirements). And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born\nchild of a married couple gained U. S. citizenship only\nthrough the father.[ 11 ] For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition\nnever held sway. Instead, the mother was regarded as the child’s\nnatural and sole guardian. At common law, the mother, and only the\nmother, was “bound to maintain [a nonmarital child] as its natural\nguardian.” 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *215–*216 (8th\ned. 1854); see Nguyen , 533 U. S., at 91–92 (O’Connor,\nJ., dissenting). In line with that understanding, in the early 20th\ncentury, the State Department sometimes permitted unwed mothers to\npass citizenship to their children, despite the absence of any\nstatutory authority for the practice. See Hearings on H. R.\n6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization,\n76th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings);\n39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 397–398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291\n(1939). See also Collins, Illegitimate Borders: Jus\nSanguinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family,\nRace, and Nation, 123 Yale L. J. 2134, 2199–2205 (2014)\n(hereinafter Collins). In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the\nfather-controls assumption concerning married parents, but codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried parents.\nThe Roosevelt administration, which proposed §1409, explained:\n“[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child] stands in the place of the\nfather . . . [,] has a right tothe custody and control of\nsuch a child as against the putative father, and is bound to\nmaintain it as its natu-ral guardian.” 1940 Hearings 431 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion\nrenders §1409’s gender-based residency rules understandable.\nFearing that a foreign-born child could turn out “more alien than\nAmerican in character,” the administration believed that a citizen\nparent with lengthy ties to the United States would counteract the\ninfluence of the alien parent. Id. , at 426–427. Concern\nabout the attachment of foreign-born children to the United States\nexplains the treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to\nthe familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have scant\ncontact with, their nonmarital children. For unwed citizen mothers,\nhowever, there was no need for a prolonged residency prophylactic:\nThe alien father, who might transmit foreign ways, was\npresumptively out of the picture. See id. , at 431; Collins\n2203 (in “nearly uniform view” of U. S. officials, “almost\ninvariably,” the mother alone “concern[ed] herself with [a\nnonmarital] child” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 2 For close to a half century, as earlier\nobserved, see supra , at 7–8, this Court has viewed with\nsuspicion laws that rely on “overbroad generalizations about the\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and\nfemales.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S., at 643, 648. In particular, we\nhave recognized that if a “statutory objective is to exclude or\n‘protect’ members of one gender” in reliance on “fixed notions\nconcerning [that gender’s] roles and abilities,” the “objective\nitself is illegitimate.” Mississippi Univ. for Women , 458\nU. S., at 725. In accord with this eventual understanding, the\nCourt has held that no “important [governmental] interest” is\nserved by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the\nobsolescing view that “unwed fathers [are] invariably less\nqualified and entitled than mothers” to take responsibility for\nnonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441\nU. S. 380, 382, 394 (1979) .[ 12 ] Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court\nhas come to comprehend, have a constraining impact, descriptive\nthough they may be of the way many people still order their\nlives.[ 13 ] Laws according or\ndenying benefits in reliance on “[s]tereotypes about women’s\ndomestic roles,” the Court has observed, may “creat[e] a\nself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that force[s] women to\ncontinue to assume the role of primary family caregiver.” Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721,\n736 (2003) . Correspondingly, such laws may disserve men who\nexercise responsibility for raising their children. See ibid. In light of the equal protection jurisprudence this\nCourt has developed since 1971, see Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531–534, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers\nwho have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly\nanachronistic. B In urging this Court nevertheless to reject\nMorales-Santana’s equal protection plea, the Government cites three\ndecisions of this Court: Fiallo v. Bell , 430\nU. S. 787 (1977) ; Miller v. Albright , 523\nU. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53\n. None controls this case. The 1952 Act provision at issue in Fiallo gave special immigration preferences to alien children of citizen\n(or lawful-permanent-resident) mothers, and to alien unwed mothers\nof citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children. 430 U. S.,\nat 788–789, and n. 1. Unwed fathers and their children,\nasserting their right to equal protection, sought the same\npreferences. Id. , at 791. Applying minimal scrutiny\n(rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on\nCongress’ “exceptionally broad power” to admit or exclude aliens. Id. , at 792, 794.[ 14 ]\nThis case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.\nMorales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a\nU. S. citizen. Examining a claim of that order, the Court has\nnot disclaimed, as it did in Fiallo , the application of an\nexacting standard of review. See Nguyen , 533 U. S., at\n60–61, 70; Miller , 523 U. S., at 434–435, n. ",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL v .\nMORALES-SANTANA certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit No. 15–1191. Argued November 9, 2016—Decided\nJune 12, 2017 The Immigration and Nationality Act provides\nthe framework for acquisition of U. S. citizenship from birth\nby a child born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen and\nthe other a citizen of another nation. Applicable to married\ncouples, the main rule in effect at the time here relevant, 8\nU. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), required the\nU. S.-citizen parent to have ten years’ physical presence in\nthe United States prior to the child’s birth, “at least five of\nwhich were after attaining” age 14. The rule is made applicable to\nunwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a), but §1409(c) creates\nan exception for an unwed U. S.-citizen mother, whose\ncitizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has\nlived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to\nthe child’s birth. Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana, who has\nlived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the U. S. citizenship of his\nbiological father, José Morales. José moved to the Dominican\nRepublic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave\nbirth to Morales-Santana. José accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household; he married\nMorales-Santana’s mother and his name was then added to hers on\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate. In 2000, the Government sought\nto remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions,\nranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did\nnot satisfy the requirement of five years’ physical presence after\nage 14. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s citizenship\nclaim and ordered his removal. Morales-Santana later moved to\nreopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government’s refusal to\nrecognize that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen\nfather violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. The\nBoard of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of\nthe equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based\nclassifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential\ntreatment of unwed mothers and fathers. To cure this infirmity, the\nCourt of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship\nthrough his father, just as he would were his mother the U. S.\ncitizen. Held : 1. The gender line Congress drew is\nincompatible with the Fifth Amendment’s requirement that the\nGovernment accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Pp. 6–23. (a) Morales-Santana satisfies the\nrequirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his\nfather’s right to equal protection. José Morales’ ability to pass\ncitizenship to his son easily satisfies the requirement that the\nthird party have a “ ‘close’ relationship with the person who\npossesses the right.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543\nU. S. 125 . And José’s death many years before the current\ncontroversy arose is “a ‘hindrance’ to [José’s] ability to protect\nhis own interests.” Ibid. Pp. 6–7. (b) Sections 1401 and 1409 date from an\nera when the Nation’s lawbooks were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. Today, such laws\nreceive the heightened scrutiny that now attends “all gender-based\nclassifications,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.\nT. B. , 511 U. S. 127 , including laws granting or denying\nbenefits “on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,” Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76 . Prescribing\none rule for mothers, another for fathers, §1409 is of the same\ngenre as the classifications declared unconstitutional in Westcott ; Reed v. Reed , 404 U. S. 71 –77; Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S. 636 –653;\nand Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207. A\nsuccessful defense therefore requires an “ ‘exceedingly\npersuasive justification.’ ” United States v. Virginia , 518 U. S. 515 . Pp. 7–9. (c) The Government must show, at least,\nthat its gender-based “ ‘classification serves “important\ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed”\nare “substantially related to [achieving] those\nobjectives.” ’ ” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533.\nThe classification must serve an important governmental interest today , for “new insights and societal understandings can\nreveal unjustified inequality . . . that once passed\nunnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges ,\n576 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 9–14. (1) At the time §1409 was enacted as part\nof the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), two once habitual, but\nnow untenable, assumptions pervaded the Nation’s citizenship laws\nand underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage,\nhusband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the sole\nguardian of a nonmarital child. In the 1940 Act, Congress codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.\nAccording to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified\nfor unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have\nscant contact with, their nonmarital children. Unwed citizen\nmothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father,\nalong with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.\nPp. 9–13. (2) For close to a half century, this\nCourt has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on “overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533. No “important [governmental] interest” is served by laws\ngrounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that\n“unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than\nmothers” to take responsibility for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441 U. S. 380 . In light of\nthis equal protection jurisprudence, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are\nanachronistic. Pp. 13–14. (d) The Government points to Fiallo v. Bell , 430 U. S. 787 ; Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53 , for support. But Fiallo involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not\npresent a claim of U. S. citizenship. And Miller and Nguyen addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well\nmet here, not the length of a parent’s prebirth residency in the\nUnited States. Pp. 14–16. (e) The Government’s suggested rationales\nfor §1409(a) and (c)’s gender-based differential do not survive\nheightened scrutiny. Pp. 16–23. (1) The Government asserts that Congress\nsought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection\nto the United States. The statute, the Government suggests,\nbracketed an unwed U. S.-citizen mother with a married couple\nin which both parents are U. S. citizens because she is the\nonly legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed\nU. S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a\ncitizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national\ninfluence of the alien mother. This rationale conforms to the\nlong-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.\nAnd the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested\ncongressional interest. Citizenship may be transmitted to children\nwho have no tie to the United States so long as their\nU. S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United\nStates for one year at any point in her life prior to the\nchild’s birth; but it may not be transmitted by a\nU. S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting\n§1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he\nacknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the\nchild in the United States. Pp. 17–19. (2) The Government also maintains that\nCongress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the\nforeign-born child of a U. S. citizen. But congressional\nhearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a\nstatelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence\nrequirements. Nor has the Government shown that the risk of\nstatelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Pp. 19–23. 2. Because this Court is not equipped to\nconvert §1409(c)’s exception for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers\ninto the main rule displacing §§1401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to\nCongress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor\ndisadvantages any person on the basis of gender. In the interim,\n§1401(a)(7)’s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to\nchildren born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. The\nlegislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs\nthe choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending\nfavorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable\ntreatment from the favored class. Ordinarily, the preferred rule is\nto extend favorable treatment. Westcott , 443 U. S., at\n89–90. Here, however, extension to fathers of §1409(c)’s favorable\ntreatment for mothers would displace Congress’ general rule, the\nlonger physical-presence requirements of §§1401(a)(7) and 1409\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers and\nU. S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the\nchild’s alien parent. Congress’ “ ‘commitment to th[is]\nresidual policy’ ” and “ ‘the degree of potential\ndisruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as\nopposed to abrogation,’ ” Heckler v. Mathews ,\n465 U. S. 728 , n. 5, indicate that Congress would likely\nhave abrogated §1409(c)’s special exception, preferring to preserve\n“the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of\ndedicated attachment,” Rogers v. Bellei , 401\nU. S. 815 . Pp. 23–28. 804 F. 3d 520, affirmed in part, reversed\nin part, and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1191 _________________ JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [June 12, 2017] Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case concerns a gender-based differential\nin the law governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a\nchild born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the\nother, a citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in\n8 U. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g)\n(2012 ed.). Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires a\nperiod of physical presence in the United States for the\nU. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially\nprescribed, was ten years’ physical presence prior to the child’s\nbirth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years\nprebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule is rendered\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a).\nCongress ordered an exception, however, for unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c), the exception\nallows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born\nabroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year\nprior to the child’s birth. The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón\nMorales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father\nwas just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)’s physical-presence\nrequirement. Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic,\nMorales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle\nimplicit in the Fifth Amendment[ 1 ] entitles him to citizenship stature. We hold that the\ngender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that\nthe Government accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Nevertheless, we cannot convert §1409(c)’s exception for\nunwed mothers into the main rule displacing §1401(a)(7) (covering\nmarried couples) and §1409(a) (covering unwed fathers). We must\ntherefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a\nphysical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other\nperiod) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one\nU. S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed. In the\ninterim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are\nadministered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination. I A We first describe in greater detail the regime\nCongress constructed. The general rules for acquiring U. S.\ncitizenship are found in 8 U. S. C. §1401, the first\nsection in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (1952 Act or INA), §301, 66Stat. 235–236. Section\n1401 sets forth the INA’s rules for determining who “shall be\nnationals and citizens of the United States at birth” by\nestablishing a range of residency and physical-presence\nrequirements calibrated primarily to the parents’ nationality and\nthe child’s place of birth. §1401(a) (1958 ed.); §1401 (2012 ed.).\nThe primacy of §1401 in the statutory scheme is evident.\nComprehensive in coverage, §1401 provides the general framework for\nthe acquisition of citizenship at birth. In particular, at the time\nrelevant here,[ 2 ] §1401(a)(7)\nprovided for the U. S. citizenship of “a person born outside the geographical\nlimits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents\none of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United\nStates who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically\npresent in the United States or its outlying possessions for a\nperiod or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five\nof which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided , That any periods of honorable service in the Armed\nForces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included\nin computing the physical presence requirements of this\nparagraph.” Congress has since reduced the duration\nrequirement to five years, two after age 14. §1401(g) (2012\ned.).[ 3 ] Section 1409 pertains specifically to children\nwith unmarried parents. Its first subsection, §1409(a),\nincorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of\n§1401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to\ntransmit U. S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the\nsame terms as a married citizen parent. Section 1409(c)—a provision\napplicable only to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers—states an\nexception to the physical-presence requirements of §§1401 and\n1409(a). Under §1409(c)’s exception, only one year of continuous\nphysical presence is required before unwed mothers may pass\ncitizenship to their children born abroad. B Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana moved to\nthe United States at age 13, and has resided in this country most\nof his life. Now facing deportation, he asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biological\nfather, José Morales, who accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household. José Morales was born in Guánica, Puerto Rico,\non March 19, 1900. Record 55–56. Puerto Rico was then, as it is\nnow, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle , 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 2–4); 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (“The term\nUnited States . . . means the continental United States,\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U. S.] Virgin\nIslands.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); §1101(a)(38) (2012\ned.) (similar), and José became a U. S. citizen under the\nOrganic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, §5, 39Stat. 953 (a predecessor\nto 8 U. S. C. §1402). After living in Puerto Rico for\nnearly two decades, José left his childhood home on February 27,\n1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. Record 57, 66. He did so to take up employment as a\nbuilder-mechanic for a U. S. company in the\nthen-U. S.-occupied Dominican Republic. Ibid. [ 4 ] By 1959, José attested in a June 21, 1971\naffidavit presented to the U. S. Embassy in the Dominican\nRepublic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Dominican\nwoman he would eventually marry. Id. , at 57. In 1962, Yrma\ngave birth to their child, respondent Luis Morales-Santana. Id. , at 166–167. While the record before us reveals little\nabout Morales-Santana’s childhood, the Dominican archives disclose\nthat Yrma and José married in 1970, and that José was then added to\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate as his father. Id. , at\n163–164, 167. José also related in the same affidavit that he was\nthen saving money “for the susten[ance] of [his] family” in\nanticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where members of\nhis family still resided. Id. , at 57. In 1975, when\nMorales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico, id. , at\n368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was attending public\nschool in the Bronx, a New York City borough, id. , at 140,\n369.[ 5 ] C In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana\nin removal proceedings based on several convictions for offenses\nunder New York State Penal Law, all of them rendered on May 17,\n1995. Id. , at 426. Morales-Santana ranked as an alien\ndespite the many years he lived in the United States, because, at\nthe time of his birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement\nof five years’ physical presence after age 14. See supra , at\n3–4, and n. 3. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s\nclaim to citizenship derived from the U. S. citizenship of his\nfather, and ordered Morales-Santana’s removal to the Dominican\nRepublic. Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a–49a. In 2010,\nMorales-Santana moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the\nGovernment’s refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from\nhis U. S.-citizen father violated the Constitution’s equal\nprotection guarantee. See Record 27, 45. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) denied the motion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a,\n42a–44a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the BIA’s decision. 804 F. 3d 520, 524\n(2015). Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of the equal\nprotection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications,\nthe court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed\nmothers and fathers. Id. , at 527–535. To cure the\nconstitutional flaw, the court further held that Morales-Santana\nderived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his\nmother the U. S. citizen. Id. , at 535–538. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit declined to follow the conflicting\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Flores-Villar , 536 F. 3d 990 (2008), see 804\nF. 3d, at 530, 535, n. 17. We granted certiorariin Flores-Villar , but ultimately affirmed by an equally divided\nCourt. Flores-Villar v. United States , 564 U. S.\n210 (2011) ( per curiam ). Taking up Morales-Santana’s\nrequest for review, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), we consider the\nmatter anew. II Because §1409 treats sons and daughters alike,\nMorales-Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based\ndiscrimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of\nMorales-Santana’s birth and was not accorded the right an unwed\nU. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her\nchild. Although the Government does not contend otherwise, we\nbriefly explain why Morales-Santana may seek to vindicate his\nfather’s right to the equal protection of the laws.[ 6 ] Ordinarily, a party “must assert his own legal\nrights” and “cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights\n. . . of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin ,\n422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975) . But we recognize an exception\nwhere, as here, “the party asserting the right has a close\nrelationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is\na hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his own\ninterests.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125,\n130 (2004) (quoting Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S.\n400, 411 (1991) ). José Morales’ ability to pass citizenship to his\nson, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies the “close\nrelationship” requirement. So, too, is the “hindrance” requirement\nwell met. José Morales’ failure to assert a claim in his own right\n“stems from disability,” not “disinterest,” Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420, 450 (1998) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), for José died in 1976, Record 140, many\nyears before the current controversy arose. See Hodel v. Irving , 481 U. S. 704 –712, 723, n. 7 (1987)\n(children and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights of\ndeceased relatives). Morales-Santana is thus the “obvious\nclaimant,” see Craig v. Boren , 429 U. S. 190,\n197 (1976) , the “best available proponent,” Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U. S. 106, 116 (1976) , of his father’s\nright to equal protection. III Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an\nera when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. See, e.g. , Hoyt v. Florida , 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961) (women\nare the “center of home and family life,” therefore they can be\n“relieved from the civic duty of jury service”); Goesaert v. Cleary , 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (States may draw “a\nsharp line between the sexes”). Today, laws of this kind are\nsubject to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends\n“all gender-based classifications.” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127, 136 (1994) ; see, e.g. , United States v. Virginia , 518\nU. S. 515 –556 (1996) (state-maintained military academy may\nnot deny admission to qualified women). Laws granting or denying benefits “on the basis\nof the sex of the qualifying parent,” our post-1970 decisions\naffirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore attract\nheightened review under the Constitution’s equal protection\nguarantee. Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76,\n84 (1979) ; see id. , at 88–89 (holding unconstitutional\nprovision of unemployed-parent benefits exclusively to fathers).\nAccord Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207\n(1977) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that denied widowers survivors’ benefits\navailable to widows); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420\nU. S. 636 –653 (1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that excluded fathers from receipt of\nchild-in-care benefits available to mothers); Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691 (1973) (plurality\nopinion) (holding unconstitutional exclusion of married female\nofficers in the military from benefits automatically accorded\nmarried male officers); cf. Reed v. Reed , 404\nU. S. 71 –77 (1971) (holding unconstitutional a probate-code\npreference for a father over a mother as administrator of a\ndeceased child’s estate).[ 7 ] Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for\nfathers, §1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we\ndeclared unconstitutional in Reed , Frontiero , Wiesenfeld , Goldfarb , and Westcott . As in\nthose cases, heightened scrutiny is in order. Successful defense of\nlegislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have\nreiterated, requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Kirchberg v. Feenstra , 450 U. S. 455,\n461 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). A The defender of legislation that\ndifferentiates on the basis of gender must show “at least that the\n[challenged] classification serves important governmental\nobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533 (quoting Mississippi\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan , 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982)\n; alteration in original); see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53, 60, 70 (2001) . Moreover, the\nclassification must substantially serve an important governmental\ninterest today , for “in interpreting the [e]qual\n[p]rotection [guarantee], [we have] recognized that new insights\nand societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality\n. . . that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 20). Here, the Government has supplied no\n“exceedingly persuasive justification,” Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted), for §1409(a)\nand (c)’s “gender-based” and “gender-biased” disparity, Westcott , 443 U. S., at 84 (internalquotation marks\nomitted). 1 History reveals what lurks behind §1409.\nEnacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54Stat.\n1139–1140, §1409 ended a century and a half of congressional\nsilence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed\nparents.[ 8 ] During this era,\ntwo once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our\nNation’s citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and\nadministrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife\nsubordinate; unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a\nnonmarital child. Under the once entrenched principle of male\ndominance in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.\n“[D]ominance [of] the husband,” this Court observed in 1915, “is an\nancient principle of our jurisprudence.” Mackenzie v. Hare , 239 U. S. 299, 311 (1915) .[ 9 ] See generally Brief for Professors of History\net al. as Amici Curiae 4–15. Through the early 20th\ncentury, a male citizen automatically conferred U. S.\ncitizenship on his alien wife. Act of Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, §2,\n10Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen , 7 Wall. 496, 498\n(1869) (the 1855 Act “confers the privileges of citizenship upon\nwomen married to citizens of the United States”); C. Bredbenner, A\nNationality of Her Own:Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship\n15–16, 20–21 (1998). A female citizen, however, was incapable of\nconferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was subject to\nexpatriation if she married an alien.[ 10 ] The family of a citizen or a lawfully admitted\npermanent resident enjoyed statutory exemptions from entry\nrequirements, but only if the citizen or resident was male. See, e.g. , Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §37, 32Stat. 1221\n(wives and children entering the country to join permanent-resident\naliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases during\ntransit shall not be deported if the diseases were easily curable\nor did not present a danger to others); S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st\nCong., 2d Sess., 415–417 (1950) (wives exempt from literacy and\nquota requirements). And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born\nchild of a married couple gained U. S. citizenship only\nthrough the father.[ 11 ] For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition\nnever held sway. Instead, the mother was regarded as the child’s\nnatural and sole guardian. At common law, the mother, and only the\nmother, was “bound to maintain [a nonmarital child] as its natural\nguardian.” 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *215–*216 (8th\ned. 1854); see Nguyen , 533 U. S., at 91–92 (O’Connor,\nJ., dissenting). In line with that understanding, in the early 20th\ncentury, the State Department sometimes permitted unwed mothers to\npass citizenship to their children, despite the absence of any\nstatutory authority for the practice. See Hearings on H. R.\n6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization,\n76th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings);\n39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 397–398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291\n(1939). See also Collins, Illegitimate Borders: Jus\nSanguinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family,\nRace, and Nation, 123 Yale L. J. 2134, 2199–2205 (2014)\n(hereinafter Collins). In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the\nfather-controls assumption concerning married parents, but codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried parents.\nThe Roosevelt administration, which proposed §1409, explained:\n“[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child] stands in the place of the\nfather . . . [,] has a right tothe custody and control of\nsuch a child as against the putative father, and is bound to\nmaintain it as its natu-ral guardian.” 1940 Hearings 431 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion\nrenders §1409’s gender-based residency rules understandable.\nFearing that a foreign-born child could turn out “more alien than\nAmerican in character,” the administration believed that a citizen\nparent with lengthy ties to the United States would counteract the\ninfluence of the alien parent. Id. , at 426–427. Concern\nabout the attachment of foreign-born children to the United States\nexplains the treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to\nthe familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have scant\ncontact with, their nonmarital children. For unwed citizen mothers,\nhowever, there was no need for a prolonged residency prophylactic:\nThe alien father, who might transmit foreign ways, was\npresumptively out of the picture. See id. , at 431; Collins\n2203 (in “nearly uniform view” of U. S. officials, “almost\ninvariably,” the mother alone “concern[ed] herself with [a\nnonmarital] child” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 2 For close to a half century, as earlier\nobserved, see supra , at 7–8, this Court has viewed with\nsuspicion laws that rely on “overbroad generalizations about the\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and\nfemales.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S., at 643, 648. In particular, we\nhave recognized that if a “statutory objective is to exclude or\n‘protect’ members of one gender” in reliance on “fixed notions\nconcerning [that gender’s] roles and abilities,” the “objective\nitself is illegitimate.” Mississippi Univ. for Women , 458\nU. S., at 725. In accord with this eventual understanding, the\nCourt has held that no “important [governmental] interest” is\nserved by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the\nobsolescing view that “unwed fathers [are] invariably less\nqualified and entitled than mothers” to take responsibility for\nnonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441\nU. S. 380, 382, 394 (1979) .[ 12 ] Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court\nhas come to comprehend, have a constraining impact, descriptive\nthough they may be of the way many people still order their\nlives.[ 13 ] Laws according or\ndenying benefits in reliance on “[s]tereotypes about women’s\ndomestic roles,” the Court has observed, may “creat[e] a\nself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that force[s] women to\ncontinue to assume the role of primary family caregiver.” Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721,\n736 (2003) . Correspondingly, such laws may disserve men who\nexercise responsibility for raising their children. See ibid. In light of the equal protection jurisprudence this\nCourt has developed since 1971, see Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531–534, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers\nwho have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly\nanachronistic. B In urging this Court nevertheless to reject\nMorales-Santana’s equal protection plea, the Government cites three\ndecisions of this Court: Fiallo v. Bell , 430\nU. S. 787 (1977) ; Miller v. Albright , 523\nU. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53\n. None controls this case. The 1952 Act provision at issue in Fiallo gave special immigration preferences to alien children of citizen\n(or lawful-permanent-resident) mothers, and to alien unwed mothers\nof citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children. 430 U. S.,\nat 788–789, and n. 1. Unwed fathers and their children,\nasserting their right to equal protection, sought the same\npreferences. Id. , at 791. Applying minimal scrutiny\n(rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on\nCongress’ “exceptionally broad power” to admit or exclude aliens. Id. , at 792, 794.[ 14 ]\nThis case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.\nMorales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a\nU. S. citizen.

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL v .\nMORALES-SANTANA certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit No. 15–1191. Argued November 9, 2016—Decided\nJune 12, 2017 The Immigration and Nationality Act provides\nthe framework for acquisition of U. S. citizenship from birth\nby a child born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen and\nthe other a citizen of another nation. Applicable to married\ncouples, the main rule in effect at the time here relevant, 8\nU. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), required the\nU. S.-citizen parent to have ten years’ physical presence in\nthe United States prior to the child’s birth, “at least five of\nwhich were after attaining” age 14. The rule is made applicable to\nunwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a), but §1409(c) creates\nan exception for an unwed U. S.-citizen mother, whose\ncitizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has\nlived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to\nthe child’s birth. Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana, who has\nlived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the U. S. citizenship of his\nbiological father, José Morales. José moved to the Dominican\nRepublic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave\nbirth to Morales-Santana. José accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household; he married\nMorales-Santana’s mother and his name was then added to hers on\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate. In 2000, the Government sought\nto remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions,\nranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did\nnot satisfy the requirement of five years’ physical presence after\nage 14. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s citizenship\nclaim and ordered his removal. Morales-Santana later moved to\nreopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government’s refusal to\nrecognize that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen\nfather violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. The\nBoard of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of\nthe equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based\nclassifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential\ntreatment of unwed mothers and fathers. To cure this infirmity, the\nCourt of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship\nthrough his father, just as he would were his mother the U. S.\ncitizen. Held : 1. The gender line Congress drew is\nincompatible with the Fifth Amendment’s requirement that the\nGovernment accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Pp. 6–23. (a) Morales-Santana satisfies the\nrequirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his\nfather’s right to equal protection. José Morales’ ability to pass\ncitizenship to his son easily satisfies the requirement that the\nthird party have a “ ‘close’ relationship with the person who\npossesses the right.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543\nU. S. 125 . And José’s death many years before the current\ncontroversy arose is “a ‘hindrance’ to [José’s] ability to protect\nhis own interests.” Ibid. Pp. 6–7. (b) Sections 1401 and 1409 date from an\nera when the Nation’s lawbooks were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. Today, such laws\nreceive the heightened scrutiny that now attends “all gender-based\nclassifications,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.\nT. B. , 511 U. S. 127 , including laws granting or denying\nbenefits “on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,” Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76 . Prescribing\none rule for mothers, another for fathers, §1409 is of the same\ngenre as the classifications declared unconstitutional in Westcott ; Reed v. Reed , 404 U. S. 71 –77; Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S. 636 –653;\nand Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207. A\nsuccessful defense therefore requires an “ ‘exceedingly\npersuasive justification.’ ” United States v. Virginia , 518 U. S. 515 . Pp. 7–9. (c) The Government must show, at least,\nthat its gender-based “ ‘classification serves “important\ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed”\nare “substantially related to [achieving] those\nobjectives.” ’ ” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533.\nThe classification must serve an important governmental interest today , for “new insights and societal understandings can\nreveal unjustified inequality . . . that once passed\nunnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges ,\n576 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 9–14. (1) At the time §1409 was enacted as part\nof the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), two once habitual, but\nnow untenable, assumptions pervaded the Nation’s citizenship laws\nand underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage,\nhusband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the sole\nguardian of a nonmarital child. In the 1940 Act, Congress codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.\nAccording to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified\nfor unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have\nscant contact with, their nonmarital children. Unwed citizen\nmothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father,\nalong with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.\nPp. 9–13. (2) For close to a half century, this\nCourt has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on “overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533. No “important [governmental] interest” is served by laws\ngrounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that\n“unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than\nmothers” to take responsibility for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441 U. S. 380 . In light of\nthis equal protection jurisprudence, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are\nanachronistic. Pp. 13–14. (d) The Government points to Fiallo v. Bell , 430 U. S. 787 ; Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53 , for support. But Fiallo involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not\npresent a claim of U. S. citizenship. And Miller and Nguyen addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well\nmet here, not the length of a parent’s prebirth residency in the\nUnited States. Pp. 14–16. (e) The Government’s suggested rationales\nfor §1409(a) and (c)’s gender-based differential do not survive\nheightened scrutiny. Pp. 16–23. (1) The Government asserts that Congress\nsought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection\nto the United States. The statute, the Government suggests,\nbracketed an unwed U. S.-citizen mother with a married couple\nin which both parents are U. S. citizens because she is the\nonly legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed\nU. S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a\ncitizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national\ninfluence of the alien mother. This rationale conforms to the\nlong-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.\nAnd the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested\ncongressional interest. Citizenship may be transmitted to children\nwho have no tie to the United States so long as their\nU. S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United\nStates for one year at any point in her life prior to the\nchild’s birth; but it may not be transmitted by a\nU. S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting\n§1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he\nacknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the\nchild in the United States. Pp. 17–19. (2) The Government also maintains that\nCongress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the\nforeign-born child of a U. S. citizen. But congressional\nhearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a\nstatelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence\nrequirements. Nor has the Government shown that the risk of\nstatelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Pp. 19–23. 2. Because this Court is not equipped to\nconvert §1409(c)’s exception for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers\ninto the main rule displacing §§1401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to\nCongress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor\ndisadvantages any person on the basis of gender. In the interim,\n§1401(a)(7)’s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to\nchildren born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. The\nlegislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs\nthe choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending\nfavorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable\ntreatment from the favored class. Ordinarily, the preferred rule is\nto extend favorable treatment. Westcott , 443 U. S., at\n89–90. Here, however, extension to fathers of §1409(c)’s favorable\ntreatment for mothers would displace Congress’ general rule, the\nlonger physical-presence requirements of §§1401(a)(7) and 1409\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers and\nU. S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the\nchild’s alien parent. Congress’ “ ‘commitment to th[is]\nresidual policy’ ” and “ ‘the degree of potential\ndisruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as\nopposed to abrogation,’ ” Heckler v. Mathews ,\n465 U. S. 728 , n. 5, indicate that Congress would likely\nhave abrogated §1409(c)’s special exception, preferring to preserve\n“the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of\ndedicated attachment,” Rogers v. Bellei , 401\nU. S. 815 . Pp. 23–28. 804 F. 3d 520, affirmed in part, reversed\nin part, and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed an opinion\nconcurring in the judgment in part, in which Alito, J., joined.\nGorsuch, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the\ncase.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1191 _________________ JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [June 12, 2017] Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case concerns a gender-based differential\nin the law governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a\nchild born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the\nother, a citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in\n8 U. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g)\n(2012 ed.). Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires a\nperiod of physical presence in the United States for the\nU. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially\nprescribed, was ten years’ physical presence prior to the child’s\nbirth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years\nprebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule is rendered\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a).\nCongress ordered an exception, however, for unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c), the exception\nallows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born\nabroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year\nprior to the child’s birth. The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón\nMorales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father\nwas just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)’s physical-presence\nrequirement. Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic,\nMorales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle\nimplicit in the Fifth Amendment[ 1 ] entitles him to citizenship stature. We hold that the\ngender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that\nthe Government accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Nevertheless, we cannot convert §1409(c)’s exception for\nunwed mothers into the main rule displacing §1401(a)(7) (covering\nmarried couples) and §1409(a) (covering unwed fathers). We must\ntherefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a\nphysical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other\nperiod) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one\nU. S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed. In the\ninterim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are\nadministered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination. I A We first describe in greater detail the regime\nCongress constructed. The general rules for acquiring U. S.\ncitizenship are found in 8 U. S. C. §1401, the first\nsection in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (1952 Act or INA), §301, 66Stat. 235–236. Section\n1401 sets forth the INA’s rules for determining who “shall be\nnationals and citizens of the United States at birth” by\nestablishing a range of residency and physical-presence\nrequirements calibrated primarily to the parents’ nationality and\nthe child’s place of birth. §1401(a) (1958 ed.); §1401 (2012 ed.).\nThe primacy of §1401 in the statutory scheme is evident.\nComprehensive in coverage, §1401 provides the general framework for\nthe acquisition of citizenship at birth. In particular, at the time\nrelevant here,[ 2 ] §1401(a)(7)\nprovided for the U. S. citizenship of “a person born outside the geographical\nlimits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents\none of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United\nStates who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically\npresent in the United States or its outlying possessions for a\nperiod or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five\nof which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided , That any periods of honorable service in the Armed\nForces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included\nin computing the physical presence requirements of this\nparagraph.” Congress has since reduced the duration\nrequirement to five years, two after age 14. §1401(g) (2012\ned.).[ 3 ] Section 1409 pertains specifically to children\nwith unmarried parents. Its first subsection, §1409(a),\nincorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of\n§1401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to\ntransmit U. S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the\nsame terms as a married citizen parent. Section 1409(c)—a provision\napplicable only to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers—states an\nexception to the physical-presence requirements of §§1401 and\n1409(a). Under §1409(c)’s exception, only one year of continuous\nphysical presence is required before unwed mothers may pass\ncitizenship to their children born abroad. B Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana moved to\nthe United States at age 13, and has resided in this country most\nof his life. Now facing deportation, he asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biological\nfather, José Morales, who accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household. José Morales was born in Guánica, Puerto Rico,\non March 19, 1900. Record 55–56. Puerto Rico was then, as it is\nnow, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle , 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 2–4); 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (“The term\nUnited States . . . means the continental United States,\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U. S.] Virgin\nIslands.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); §1101(a)(38) (2012\ned.) (similar), and José became a U. S. citizen under the\nOrganic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, §5, 39Stat. 953 (a predecessor\nto 8 U. S. C. §1402). After living in Puerto Rico for\nnearly two decades, José left his childhood home on February 27,\n1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. Record 57, 66. He did so to take up employment as a\nbuilder-mechanic for a U. S. company in the\nthen-U. S.-occupied Dominican Republic. Ibid. [ 4 ] By 1959, José attested in a June 21, 1971\naffidavit presented to the U. S. Embassy in the Dominican\nRepublic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Dominican\nwoman he would eventually marry. Id. , at 57. In 1962, Yrma\ngave birth to their child, respondent Luis Morales-Santana. Id. , at 166–167. While the record before us reveals little\nabout Morales-Santana’s childhood, the Dominican archives disclose\nthat Yrma and José married in 1970, and that José was then added to\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate as his father. Id. , at\n163–164, 167. José also related in the same affidavit that he was\nthen saving money “for the susten[ance] of [his] family” in\nanticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where members of\nhis family still resided. Id. , at 57. In 1975, when\nMorales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico, id. , at\n368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was attending public\nschool in the Bronx, a New York City borough, id. , at 140,\n369.[ 5 ] C In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana\nin removal proceedings based on several convictions for offenses\nunder New York State Penal Law, all of them rendered on May 17,\n1995. Id. , at 426. Morales-Santana ranked as an alien\ndespite the many years he lived in the United States, because, at\nthe time of his birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement\nof five years’ physical presence after age 14. See supra , at\n3–4, and n. 3. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s\nclaim to citizenship derived from the U. S. citizenship of his\nfather, and ordered Morales-Santana’s removal to the Dominican\nRepublic. Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a–49a. In 2010,\nMorales-Santana moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the\nGovernment’s refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from\nhis U. S.-citizen father violated the Constitution’s equal\nprotection guarantee. See Record 27, 45. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) denied the motion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a,\n42a–44a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the BIA’s decision. 804 F. 3d 520, 524\n(2015). Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of the equal\nprotection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications,\nthe court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed\nmothers and fathers. Id. , at 527–535. To cure the\nconstitutional flaw, the court further held that Morales-Santana\nderived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his\nmother the U. S. citizen. Id. , at 535–538. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit declined to follow the conflicting\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Flores-Villar , 536 F. 3d 990 (2008), see 804\nF. 3d, at 530, 535, n. 17. We granted certiorariin Flores-Villar , but ultimately affirmed by an equally divided\nCourt. Flores-Villar v. United States , 564 U. S.\n210 (2011) ( per curiam ). Taking up Morales-Santana’s\nrequest for review, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), we consider the\nmatter anew. II Because §1409 treats sons and daughters alike,\nMorales-Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based\ndiscrimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of\nMorales-Santana’s birth and was not accorded the right an unwed\nU. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her\nchild. Although the Government does not contend otherwise, we\nbriefly explain why Morales-Santana may seek to vindicate his\nfather’s right to the equal protection of the laws.[ 6 ] Ordinarily, a party “must assert his own legal\nrights” and “cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights\n. . . of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin ,\n422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975) . But we recognize an exception\nwhere, as here, “the party asserting the right has a close\nrelationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is\na hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his own\ninterests.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125,\n130 (2004) (quoting Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S.\n400, 411 (1991) ). José Morales’ ability to pass citizenship to his\nson, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies the “close\nrelationship” requirement. So, too, is the “hindrance” requirement\nwell met. José Morales’ failure to assert a claim in his own right\n“stems from disability,” not “disinterest,” Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420, 450 (1998) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), for José died in 1976, Record 140, many\nyears before the current controversy arose. See Hodel v. Irving , 481 U. S. 704 –712, 723, n. 7 (1987)\n(children and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights of\ndeceased relatives). Morales-Santana is thus the “obvious\nclaimant,” see Craig v. Boren , 429 U. S. 190,\n197 (1976) , the “best available proponent,” Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U. S. 106, 116 (1976) , of his father’s\nright to equal protection. III Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an\nera when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. See, e.g. , Hoyt v. Florida , 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961) (women\nare the “center of home and family life,” therefore they can be\n“relieved from the civic duty of jury service”); Goesaert v. Cleary , 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (States may draw “a\nsharp line between the sexes”). Today, laws of this kind are\nsubject to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends\n“all gender-based classifications.” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127, 136 (1994) ; see, e.g. , United States v. Virginia , 518\nU. S. 515 –556 (1996) (state-maintained military academy may\nnot deny admission to qualified women). Laws granting or denying benefits “on the basis\nof the sex of the qualifying parent,” our post-1970 decisions\naffirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore attract\nheightened review under the Constitution’s equal protection\nguarantee. Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76,\n84 (1979) ; see id. , at 88–89 (holding unconstitutional\nprovision of unemployed-parent benefits exclusively to fathers).\nAccord Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207\n(1977) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that denied widowers survivors’ benefits\navailable to widows); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420\nU. S. 636 –653 (1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that excluded fathers from receipt of\nchild-in-care benefits available to mothers); Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691 (1973) (plurality\nopinion) (holding unconstitutional exclusion of married female\nofficers in the military from benefits automatically accorded\nmarried male officers); cf. Reed v. Reed , 404\nU. S. 71 –77 (1971) (holding unconstitutional a probate-code\npreference for a father over a mother as administrator of a\ndeceased child’s estate).[ 7 ] Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for\nfathers, §1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we\ndeclared unconstitutional in Reed , Frontiero , Wiesenfeld , Goldfarb , and Westcott . As in\nthose cases, heightened scrutiny is in order. Successful defense of\nlegislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have\nreiterated, requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Kirchberg v. Feenstra , 450 U. S. 455,\n461 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). A The defender of legislation that\ndifferentiates on the basis of gender must show “at least that the\n[challenged] classification serves important governmental\nobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533 (quoting Mississippi\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan , 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982)\n; alteration in original); see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53, 60, 70 (2001) . Moreover, the\nclassification must substantially serve an important governmental\ninterest today , for “in interpreting the [e]qual\n[p]rotection [guarantee], [we have] recognized that new insights\nand societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality\n. . . that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 20). Here, the Government has supplied no\n“exceedingly persuasive justification,” Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted), for §1409(a)\nand (c)’s “gender-based” and “gender-biased” disparity, Westcott , 443 U. S., at 84 (internalquotation marks\nomitted). 1 History reveals what lurks behind §1409.\nEnacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54Stat.\n1139–1140, §1409 ended a century and a half of congressional\nsilence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed\nparents.[ 8 ] During this era,\ntwo once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our\nNation’s citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and\nadministrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife\nsubordinate; unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a\nnonmarital child. Under the once entrenched principle of male\ndominance in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.\n“[D]ominance [of] the husband,” this Court observed in 1915, “is an\nancient principle of our jurisprudence.” Mackenzie v. Hare , 239 U. S. 299, 311 (1915) .[ 9 ] See generally Brief for Professors of History\net al. as Amici Curiae 4–15. Through the early 20th\ncentury, a male citizen automatically conferred U. S.\ncitizenship on his alien wife. Act of Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, §2,\n10Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen , 7 Wall. 496, 498\n(1869) (the 1855 Act “confers the privileges of citizenship upon\nwomen married to citizens of the United States”); C. Bredbenner, A\nNationality of Her Own:Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship\n15–16, 20–21 (1998). A female citizen, however, was incapable of\nconferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was subject to\nexpatriation if she married an alien.[ 10 ] The family of a citizen or a lawfully admitted\npermanent resident enjoyed statutory exemptions from entry\nrequirements, but only if the citizen or resident was male. See, e.g. , Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §37, 32Stat. 1221\n(wives and children entering the country to join permanent-resident\naliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases during\ntransit shall not be deported if the diseases were easily curable\nor did not present a danger to others); S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st\nCong., 2d Sess., 415–417 (1950) (wives exempt from literacy and\nquota requirements). And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born\nchild of a married couple gained U. S. citizenship only\nthrough the father.[ 11 ] For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition\nnever held sway. Instead, the mother was regarded as the child’s\nnatural and sole guardian. At common law, the mother, and only the\nmother, was “bound to maintain [a nonmarital child] as its natural\nguardian.” 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *215–*216 (8th\ned. 1854); see Nguyen , 533 U. S., at 91–92 (O’Connor,\nJ., dissenting). In line with that understanding, in the early 20th\ncentury, the State Department sometimes permitted unwed mothers to\npass citizenship to their children, despite the absence of any\nstatutory authority for the practice. See Hearings on H. R.\n6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization,\n76th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings);\n39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 397–398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291\n(1939). See also Collins, Illegitimate Borders: Jus\nSanguinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family,\nRace, and Nation, 123 Yale L. J. 2134, 2199–2205 (2014)\n(hereinafter Collins). In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the\nfather-controls assumption concerning married parents, but codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried parents.\nThe Roosevelt administration, which proposed §1409, explained:\n“[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child] stands in the place of the\nfather . . . [,] has a right tothe custody and control of\nsuch a child as against the putative father, and is bound to\nmaintain it as its natu-ral guardian.” 1940 Hearings 431 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion\nrenders §1409’s gender-based residency rules understandable.\nFearing that a foreign-born child could turn out “more alien than\nAmerican in character,” the administration believed that a citizen\nparent with lengthy ties to the United States would counteract the\ninfluence of the alien parent. Id. , at 426–427. Concern\nabout the attachment of foreign-born children to the United States\nexplains the treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to\nthe familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have scant\ncontact with, their nonmarital children. For unwed citizen mothers,\nhowever, there was no need for a prolonged residency prophylactic:\nThe alien father, who might transmit foreign ways, was\npresumptively out of the picture. See id. , at 431; Collins\n2203 (in “nearly uniform view” of U. S. officials, “almost\ninvariably,” the mother alone “concern[ed] herself with [a\nnonmarital] child” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 2 For close to a half century, as earlier\nobserved, see supra , at 7–8, this Court has viewed with\nsuspicion laws that rely on “overbroad generalizations about the\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and\nfemales.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S., at 643, 648. In particular, we\nhave recognized that if a “statutory objective is to exclude or\n‘protect’ members of one gender” in reliance on “fixed notions\nconcerning [that gender’s] roles and abilities,” the “objective\nitself is illegitimate.” Mississippi Univ. for Women , 458\nU. S., at 725. In accord with this eventual understanding, the\nCourt has held that no “important [governmental] interest” is\nserved by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the\nobsolescing view that “unwed fathers [are] invariably less\nqualified and entitled than mothers” to take responsibility for\nnonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441\nU. S. 380, 382, 394 (1979) .[ 12 ] Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court\nhas come to comprehend, have a constraining impact, descriptive\nthough they may be of the way many people still order their\nlives.[ 13 ] Laws according or\ndenying benefits in reliance on “[s]tereotypes about women’s\ndomestic roles,” the Court has observed, may “creat[e] a\nself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that force[s] women to\ncontinue to assume the role of primary family caregiver.” Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721,\n736 (2003) . Correspondingly, such laws may disserve men who\nexercise responsibility for raising their children. See ibid. In light of the equal protection jurisprudence this\nCourt has developed since 1971, see Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531–534, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers\nwho have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly\nanachronistic. B In urging this Court nevertheless to reject\nMorales-Santana’s equal protection plea, the Government cites three\ndecisions of this Court: Fiallo v. Bell , 430\nU. S. 787 (1977) ; Miller v. Albright , 523\nU. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53\n. None controls this case. The 1952 Act provision at issue in Fiallo gave special immigration preferences to alien children of citizen\n(or lawful-permanent-resident) mothers, and to alien unwed mothers\nof citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children. 430 U. S.,\nat 788–789, and n. 1. Unwed fathers and their children,\nasserting their right to equal protection, sought the same\npreferences. Id. , at 791. Applying minimal scrutiny\n(rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on\nCongress’ “exceptionally broad power” to admit or exclude aliens. Id. , at 792, 794.[ 14 ]\nThis case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.\nMorales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a\nU. S. citizen. Examining a claim of that order, the Court has\nnot disclaimed, as it did in Fiallo , the application of an\nexacting standard of review. See Nguyen , 533 U. S., at\n60–61, 70; Miller , 523 U. S., at 434–435, n. ",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL v .\nMORALES-SANTANA certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit No. 15–1191. Argued November 9, 2016—Decided\nJune 12, 2017 The Immigration and Nationality Act provides\nthe framework for acquisition of U. S. citizenship from birth\nby a child born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen and\nthe other a citizen of another nation. Applicable to married\ncouples, the main rule in effect at the time here relevant, 8\nU. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), required the\nU. S.-citizen parent to have ten years’ physical presence in\nthe United States prior to the child’s birth, “at least five of\nwhich were after attaining” age 14. The rule is made applicable to\nunwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a), but §1409(c) creates\nan exception for an unwed U. S.-citizen mother, whose\ncitizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has\nlived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to\nthe child’s birth. Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana, who has\nlived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the U. S. citizenship of his\nbiological father, José Morales. José moved to the Dominican\nRepublic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave\nbirth to Morales-Santana. José accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household; he married\nMorales-Santana’s mother and his name was then added to hers on\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate. In 2000, the Government sought\nto remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions,\nranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did\nnot satisfy the requirement of five years’ physical presence after\nage 14. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s citizenship\nclaim and ordered his removal. Morales-Santana later moved to\nreopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government’s refusal to\nrecognize that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen\nfather violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. The\nBoard of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of\nthe equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based\nclassifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential\ntreatment of unwed mothers and fathers. To cure this infirmity, the\nCourt of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship\nthrough his father, just as he would were his mother the U. S.\ncitizen. Held : 1. The gender line Congress drew is\nincompatible with the Fifth Amendment’s requirement that the\nGovernment accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Pp. 6–23. (a) Morales-Santana satisfies the\nrequirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his\nfather’s right to equal protection. José Morales’ ability to pass\ncitizenship to his son easily satisfies the requirement that the\nthird party have a “ ‘close’ relationship with the person who\npossesses the right.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543\nU. S. 125 . And José’s death many years before the current\ncontroversy arose is “a ‘hindrance’ to [José’s] ability to protect\nhis own interests.” Ibid. Pp. 6–7. (b) Sections 1401 and 1409 date from an\nera when the Nation’s lawbooks were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. Today, such laws\nreceive the heightened scrutiny that now attends “all gender-based\nclassifications,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.\nT. B. , 511 U. S. 127 , including laws granting or denying\nbenefits “on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,” Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76 . Prescribing\none rule for mothers, another for fathers, §1409 is of the same\ngenre as the classifications declared unconstitutional in Westcott ; Reed v. Reed , 404 U. S. 71 –77; Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S. 636 –653;\nand Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207. A\nsuccessful defense therefore requires an “ ‘exceedingly\npersuasive justification.’ ” United States v. Virginia , 518 U. S. 515 . Pp. 7–9. (c) The Government must show, at least,\nthat its gender-based “ ‘classification serves “important\ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed”\nare “substantially related to [achieving] those\nobjectives.” ’ ” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533.\nThe classification must serve an important governmental interest today , for “new insights and societal understandings can\nreveal unjustified inequality . . . that once passed\nunnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges ,\n576 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 9–14. (1) At the time §1409 was enacted as part\nof the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), two once habitual, but\nnow untenable, assumptions pervaded the Nation’s citizenship laws\nand underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage,\nhusband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the sole\nguardian of a nonmarital child. In the 1940 Act, Congress codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.\nAccording to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified\nfor unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have\nscant contact with, their nonmarital children. Unwed citizen\nmothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father,\nalong with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.\nPp. 9–13. (2) For close to a half century, this\nCourt has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on “overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533. No “important [governmental] interest” is served by laws\ngrounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that\n“unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than\nmothers” to take responsibility for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441 U. S. 380 . In light of\nthis equal protection jurisprudence, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are\nanachronistic. Pp. 13–14. (d) The Government points to Fiallo v. Bell , 430 U. S. 787 ; Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53 , for support. But Fiallo involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not\npresent a claim of U. S. citizenship. And Miller and Nguyen addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well\nmet here, not the length of a parent’s prebirth residency in the\nUnited States. Pp. 14–16. (e) The Government’s suggested rationales\nfor §1409(a) and (c)’s gender-based differential do not survive\nheightened scrutiny. Pp. 16–23. (1) The Government asserts that Congress\nsought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection\nto the United States. The statute, the Government suggests,\nbracketed an unwed U. S.-citizen mother with a married couple\nin which both parents are U. S. citizens because she is the\nonly legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed\nU. S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a\ncitizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national\ninfluence of the alien mother. This rationale conforms to the\nlong-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.\nAnd the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested\ncongressional interest. Citizenship may be transmitted to children\nwho have no tie to the United States so long as their\nU. S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United\nStates for one year at any point in her life prior to the\nchild’s birth; but it may not be transmitted by a\nU. S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting\n§1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he\nacknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the\nchild in the United States. Pp. 17–19. (2) The Government also maintains that\nCongress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the\nforeign-born child of a U. S. citizen. But congressional\nhearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a\nstatelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence\nrequirements. Nor has the Government shown that the risk of\nstatelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Pp. 19–23. 2. Because this Court is not equipped to\nconvert §1409(c)’s exception for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers\ninto the main rule displacing §§1401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to\nCongress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor\ndisadvantages any person on the basis of gender. In the interim,\n§1401(a)(7)’s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to\nchildren born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. The\nlegislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs\nthe choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending\nfavorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable\ntreatment from the favored class. Ordinarily, the preferred rule is\nto extend favorable treatment. Westcott , 443 U. S., at\n89–90. Here, however, extension to fathers of §1409(c)’s favorable\ntreatment for mothers would displace Congress’ general rule, the\nlonger physical-presence requirements of §§1401(a)(7) and 1409\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers and\nU. S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the\nchild’s alien parent. Congress’ “ ‘commitment to th[is]\nresidual policy’ ” and “ ‘the degree of potential\ndisruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as\nopposed to abrogation,’ ” Heckler v. Mathews ,\n465 U. S. 728 , n. 5, indicate that Congress would likely\nhave abrogated §1409(c)’s special exception, preferring to preserve\n“the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of\ndedicated attachment,” Rogers v. Bellei , 401\nU. S. 815 . Pp. 23–28. 804 F. 3d 520, affirmed in part, reversed\nin part, and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed an opinion\nconcurring in the judgment in part, in which Alito, J., joined.\nGorsuch, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the\ncase.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1191 _________________ JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [June 12, 2017] Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case concerns a gender-based differential\nin the law governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a\nchild born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the\nother, a citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in\n8 U. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g)\n(2012 ed.). Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires a\nperiod of physical presence in the United States for the\nU. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially\nprescribed, was ten years’ physical presence prior to the child’s\nbirth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years\nprebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule is rendered\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a).\nCongress ordered an exception, however, for unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c), the exception\nallows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born\nabroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year\nprior to the child’s birth. The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón\nMorales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father\nwas just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)’s physical-presence\nrequirement. Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic,\nMorales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle\nimplicit in the Fifth Amendment[ 1 ] entitles him to citizenship stature. We hold that the\ngender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that\nthe Government accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Nevertheless, we cannot convert §1409(c)’s exception for\nunwed mothers into the main rule displacing §1401(a)(7) (covering\nmarried couples) and §1409(a) (covering unwed fathers). We must\ntherefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a\nphysical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other\nperiod) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one\nU. S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed. In the\ninterim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are\nadministered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination. I A We first describe in greater detail the regime\nCongress constructed. The general rules for acquiring U. S.\ncitizenship are found in 8 U. S. C. §1401, the first\nsection in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (1952 Act or INA), §301, 66Stat. 235–236. Section\n1401 sets forth the INA’s rules for determining who “shall be\nnationals and citizens of the United States at birth” by\nestablishing a range of residency and physical-presence\nrequirements calibrated primarily to the parents’ nationality and\nthe child’s place of birth. §1401(a) (1958 ed.); §1401 (2012 ed.).\nThe primacy of §1401 in the statutory scheme is evident.\nComprehensive in coverage, §1401 provides the general framework for\nthe acquisition of citizenship at birth. In particular, at the time\nrelevant here,[ 2 ] §1401(a)(7)\nprovided for the U. S. citizenship of “a person born outside the geographical\nlimits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents\none of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United\nStates who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically\npresent in the United States or its outlying possessions for a\nperiod or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five\nof which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided , That any periods of honorable service in the Armed\nForces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included\nin computing the physical presence requirements of this\nparagraph.” Congress has since reduced the duration\nrequirement to five years, two after age 14. §1401(g) (2012\ned.).[ 3 ] Section 1409 pertains specifically to children\nwith unmarried parents. Its first subsection, §1409(a),\nincorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of\n§1401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to\ntransmit U. S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the\nsame terms as a married citizen parent. Section 1409(c)—a provision\napplicable only to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers—states an\nexception to the physical-presence requirements of §§1401 and\n1409(a). Under §1409(c)’s exception, only one year of continuous\nphysical presence is required before unwed mothers may pass\ncitizenship to their children born abroad. B Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana moved to\nthe United States at age 13, and has resided in this country most\nof his life. Now facing deportation, he asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biological\nfather, José Morales, who accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household. José Morales was born in Guánica, Puerto Rico,\non March 19, 1900. Record 55–56. Puerto Rico was then, as it is\nnow, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle , 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 2–4); 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (“The term\nUnited States . . . means the continental United States,\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U. S.] Virgin\nIslands.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); §1101(a)(38) (2012\ned.) (similar), and José became a U. S. citizen under the\nOrganic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, §5, 39Stat. 953 (a predecessor\nto 8 U. S. C. §1402). After living in Puerto Rico for\nnearly two decades, José left his childhood home on February 27,\n1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. Record 57, 66. He did so to take up employment as a\nbuilder-mechanic for a U. S. company in the\nthen-U. S.-occupied Dominican Republic. Ibid. [ 4 ] By 1959, José attested in a June 21, 1971\naffidavit presented to the U. S. Embassy in the Dominican\nRepublic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Dominican\nwoman he would eventually marry. Id. , at 57. In 1962, Yrma\ngave birth to their child, respondent Luis Morales-Santana. Id. , at 166–167. While the record before us reveals little\nabout Morales-Santana’s childhood, the Dominican archives disclose\nthat Yrma and José married in 1970, and that José was then added to\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate as his father. Id. , at\n163–164, 167. José also related in the same affidavit that he was\nthen saving money “for the susten[ance] of [his] family” in\nanticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where members of\nhis family still resided. Id. , at 57. In 1975, when\nMorales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico, id. , at\n368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was attending public\nschool in the Bronx, a New York City borough, id. , at 140,\n369.[ 5 ] C In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana\nin removal proceedings based on several convictions for offenses\nunder New York State Penal Law, all of them rendered on May 17,\n1995. Id. , at 426. Morales-Santana ranked as an alien\ndespite the many years he lived in the United States, because, at\nthe time of his birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement\nof five years’ physical presence after age 14. See supra , at\n3–4, and n. 3. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s\nclaim to citizenship derived from the U. S. citizenship of his\nfather, and ordered Morales-Santana’s removal to the Dominican\nRepublic. Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a–49a. In 2010,\nMorales-Santana moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the\nGovernment’s refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from\nhis U. S.-citizen father violated the Constitution’s equal\nprotection guarantee. See Record 27, 45. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) denied the motion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a,\n42a–44a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the BIA’s decision. 804 F. 3d 520, 524\n(2015). Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of the equal\nprotection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications,\nthe court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed\nmothers and fathers. Id. , at 527–535. To cure the\nconstitutional flaw, the court further held that Morales-Santana\nderived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his\nmother the U. S. citizen. Id. , at 535–538. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit declined to follow the conflicting\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Flores-Villar , 536 F. 3d 990 (2008), see 804\nF. 3d, at 530, 535, n. 17. We granted certiorariin Flores-Villar , but ultimately affirmed by an equally divided\nCourt. Flores-Villar v. United States , 564 U. S.\n210 (2011) ( per curiam ). Taking up Morales-Santana’s\nrequest for review, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), we consider the\nmatter anew. II Because §1409 treats sons and daughters alike,\nMorales-Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based\ndiscrimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of\nMorales-Santana’s birth and was not accorded the right an unwed\nU. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her\nchild. Although the Government does not contend otherwise, we\nbriefly explain why Morales-Santana may seek to vindicate his\nfather’s right to the equal protection of the laws.[ 6 ] Ordinarily, a party “must assert his own legal\nrights” and “cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights\n. . . of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin ,\n422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975) . But we recognize an exception\nwhere, as here, “the party asserting the right has a close\nrelationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is\na hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his own\ninterests.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125,\n130 (2004) (quoting Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S.\n400, 411 (1991) ). José Morales’ ability to pass citizenship to his\nson, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies the “close\nrelationship” requirement. So, too, is the “hindrance” requirement\nwell met. José Morales’ failure to assert a claim in his own right\n“stems from disability,” not “disinterest,” Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420, 450 (1998) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), for José died in 1976, Record 140, many\nyears before the current controversy arose. See Hodel v. Irving , 481 U. S. 704 –712, 723, n. 7 (1987)\n(children and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights of\ndeceased relatives). Morales-Santana is thus the “obvious\nclaimant,” see Craig v. Boren , 429 U. S. 190,\n197 (1976) , the “best available proponent,” Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U. S. 106, 116 (1976) , of his father’s\nright to equal protection. III Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an\nera when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. See, e.g. , Hoyt v. Florida , 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961) (women\nare the “center of home and family life,” therefore they can be\n“relieved from the civic duty of jury service”); Goesaert v. Cleary , 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (States may draw “a\nsharp line between the sexes”). Today, laws of this kind are\nsubject to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends\n“all gender-based classifications.” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127, 136 (1994) ; see, e.g. , United States v. Virginia , 518\nU. S. 515 –556 (1996) (state-maintained military academy may\nnot deny admission to qualified women). Laws granting or denying benefits “on the basis\nof the sex of the qualifying parent,” our post-1970 decisions\naffirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore attract\nheightened review under the Constitution’s equal protection\nguarantee. Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76,\n84 (1979) ; see id. , at 88–89 (holding unconstitutional\nprovision of unemployed-parent benefits exclusively to fathers).\nAccord Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207\n(1977) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that denied widowers survivors’ benefits\navailable to widows); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420\nU. S. 636 –653 (1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that excluded fathers from receipt of\nchild-in-care benefits available to mothers); Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691 (1973) (plurality\nopinion) (holding unconstitutional exclusion of married female\nofficers in the military from benefits automatically accorded\nmarried male officers); cf. Reed v. Reed , 404\nU. S. 71 –77 (1971) (holding unconstitutional a probate-code\npreference for a father over a mother as administrator of a\ndeceased child’s estate).[ 7 ] Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for\nfathers, §1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we\ndeclared unconstitutional in Reed , Frontiero , Wiesenfeld , Goldfarb , and Westcott . As in\nthose cases, heightened scrutiny is in order. Successful defense of\nlegislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have\nreiterated, requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Kirchberg v. Feenstra , 450 U. S. 455,\n461 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). A The defender of legislation that\ndifferentiates on the basis of gender must show “at least that the\n[challenged] classification serves important governmental\nobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533 (quoting Mississippi\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan , 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982)\n; alteration in original); see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53, 60, 70 (2001) . Moreover, the\nclassification must substantially serve an important governmental\ninterest today , for “in interpreting the [e]qual\n[p]rotection [guarantee], [we have] recognized that new insights\nand societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality\n. . . that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 20). Here, the Government has supplied no\n“exceedingly persuasive justification,” Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted), for §1409(a)\nand (c)’s “gender-based” and “gender-biased” disparity, Westcott , 443 U. S., at 84 (internalquotation marks\nomitted). 1 History reveals what lurks behind §1409.\nEnacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54Stat.\n1139–1140, §1409 ended a century and a half of congressional\nsilence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed\nparents.[ 8 ] During this era,\ntwo once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our\nNation’s citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and\nadministrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife\nsubordinate; unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a\nnonmarital child. Under the once entrenched principle of male\ndominance in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.\n“[D]ominance [of] the husband,” this Court observed in 1915, “is an\nancient principle of our jurisprudence.” Mackenzie v. Hare , 239 U. S. 299, 311 (1915) .[ 9 ] See generally Brief for Professors of History\net al. as Amici Curiae 4–15. Through the early 20th\ncentury, a male citizen automatically conferred U. S.\ncitizenship on his alien wife. Act of Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, §2,\n10Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen , 7 Wall. 496, 498\n(1869) (the 1855 Act “confers the privileges of citizenship upon\nwomen married to citizens of the United States”); C. Bredbenner, A\nNationality of Her Own:Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship\n15–16, 20–21 (1998). A female citizen, however, was incapable of\nconferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was subject to\nexpatriation if she married an alien.[ 10 ] The family of a citizen or a lawfully admitted\npermanent resident enjoyed statutory exemptions from entry\nrequirements, but only if the citizen or resident was male. See, e.g. , Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §37, 32Stat. 1221\n(wives and children entering the country to join permanent-resident\naliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases during\ntransit shall not be deported if the diseases were easily curable\nor did not present a danger to others); S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st\nCong., 2d Sess., 415–417 (1950) (wives exempt from literacy and\nquota requirements). And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born\nchild of a married couple gained U. S. citizenship only\nthrough the father.[ 11 ] For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition\nnever held sway. Instead, the mother was regarded as the child’s\nnatural and sole guardian. At common law, the mother, and only the\nmother, was “bound to maintain [a nonmarital child] as its natural\nguardian.” 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *215–*216 (8th\ned. 1854); see Nguyen , 533 U. S., at 91–92 (O’Connor,\nJ., dissenting). In line with that understanding, in the early 20th\ncentury, the State Department sometimes permitted unwed mothers to\npass citizenship to their children, despite the absence of any\nstatutory authority for the practice. See Hearings on H. R.\n6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization,\n76th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings);\n39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 397–398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291\n(1939). See also Collins, Illegitimate Borders: Jus\nSanguinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family,\nRace, and Nation, 123 Yale L. J. 2134, 2199–2205 (2014)\n(hereinafter Collins). In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the\nfather-controls assumption concerning married parents, but codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried parents.\nThe Roosevelt administration, which proposed §1409, explained:\n“[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child] stands in the place of the\nfather . . . [,] has a right tothe custody and control of\nsuch a child as against the putative father, and is bound to\nmaintain it as its natu-ral guardian.” 1940 Hearings 431 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion\nrenders §1409’s gender-based residency rules understandable.\nFearing that a foreign-born child could turn out “more alien than\nAmerican in character,” the administration believed that a citizen\nparent with lengthy ties to the United States would counteract the\ninfluence of the alien parent. Id. , at 426–427. Concern\nabout the attachment of foreign-born children to the United States\nexplains the treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to\nthe familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have scant\ncontact with, their nonmarital children. For unwed citizen mothers,\nhowever, there was no need for a prolonged residency prophylactic:\nThe alien father, who might transmit foreign ways, was\npresumptively out of the picture. See id. , at 431; Collins\n2203 (in “nearly uniform view” of U. S. officials, “almost\ninvariably,” the mother alone “concern[ed] herself with [a\nnonmarital] child” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 2 For close to a half century, as earlier\nobserved, see supra , at 7–8, this Court has viewed with\nsuspicion laws that rely on “overbroad generalizations about the\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and\nfemales.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S., at 643, 648. In particular, we\nhave recognized that if a “statutory objective is to exclude or\n‘protect’ members of one gender” in reliance on “fixed notions\nconcerning [that gender’s] roles and abilities,” the “objective\nitself is illegitimate.” Mississippi Univ. for Women , 458\nU. S., at 725. In accord with this eventual understanding, the\nCourt has held that no “important [governmental] interest” is\nserved by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the\nobsolescing view that “unwed fathers [are] invariably less\nqualified and entitled than mothers” to take responsibility for\nnonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441\nU. S. 380, 382, 394 (1979) .[ 12 ] Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court\nhas come to comprehend, have a constraining impact, descriptive\nthough they may be of the way many people still order their\nlives.[ 13 ] Laws according or\ndenying benefits in reliance on “[s]tereotypes about women’s\ndomestic roles,” the Court has observed, may “creat[e] a\nself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that force[s] women to\ncontinue to assume the role of primary family caregiver.” Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721,\n736 (2003) . Correspondingly, such laws may disserve men who\nexercise responsibility for raising their children. See ibid. In light of the equal protection jurisprudence this\nCourt has developed since 1971, see Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531–534, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers\nwho have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly\nanachronistic. B In urging this Court nevertheless to reject\nMorales-Santana’s equal protection plea, the Government cites three\ndecisions of this Court: Fiallo v. Bell , 430\nU. S. 787 (1977) ; Miller v. Albright , 523\nU. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53\n. None controls this case. The 1952 Act provision at issue in Fiallo gave special immigration preferences to alien children of citizen\n(or lawful-permanent-resident) mothers, and to alien unwed mothers\nof citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children. 430 U. S.,\nat 788–789, and n. 1. Unwed fathers and their children,\nasserting their right to equal protection, sought the same\npreferences. Id. , at 791. Applying minimal scrutiny\n(rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on\nCongress’ “exceptionally broad power” to admit or exclude aliens. Id. , at 792, 794.[ 14 ]\nThis case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.\nMorales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a\nU. S. citizen. Examining a claim of that order, the Court has\nnot disclaimed, as it did in Fiallo , the application of an\nexacting standard of review. See Nguyen , 533 U. S., at\n60–61, 70; Miller , 523 U. S., at 434–435, n. ",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL v .\nMORALES-SANTANA certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit No. 15–1191. Argued November 9, 2016—Decided\nJune 12, 2017 The Immigration and Nationality Act provides\nthe framework for acquisition of U. S. citizenship from birth\nby a child born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen and\nthe other a citizen of another nation. Applicable to married\ncouples, the main rule in effect at the time here relevant, 8\nU. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), required the\nU. S.-citizen parent to have ten years’ physical presence in\nthe United States prior to the child’s birth, “at least five of\nwhich were after attaining” age 14. The rule is made applicable to\nunwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a), but §1409(c) creates\nan exception for an unwed U. S.-citizen mother, whose\ncitizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has\nlived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to\nthe child’s birth. Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana, who has\nlived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the U. S. citizenship of his\nbiological father, José Morales. José moved to the Dominican\nRepublic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave\nbirth to Morales-Santana. José accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household; he married\nMorales-Santana’s mother and his name was then added to hers on\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate. In 2000, the Government sought\nto remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions,\nranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did\nnot satisfy the requirement of five years’ physical presence after\nage 14. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s citizenship\nclaim and ordered his removal. Morales-Santana later moved to\nreopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government’s refusal to\nrecognize that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen\nfather violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. The\nBoard of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of\nthe equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based\nclassifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential\ntreatment of unwed mothers and fathers. To cure this infirmity, the\nCourt of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship\nthrough his father, just as he would were his mother the U. S.\ncitizen. Held : 1. The gender line Congress drew is\nincompatible with the Fifth Amendment’s requirement that the\nGovernment accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Pp. 6–23. (a) Morales-Santana satisfies the\nrequirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his\nfather’s right to equal protection. José Morales’ ability to pass\ncitizenship to his son easily satisfies the requirement that the\nthird party have a “ ‘close’ relationship with the person who\npossesses the right.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543\nU. S. 125 . And José’s death many years before the current\ncontroversy arose is “a ‘hindrance’ to [José’s] ability to protect\nhis own interests.” Ibid. Pp. 6–7. (b) Sections 1401 and 1409 date from an\nera when the Nation’s lawbooks were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. Today, such laws\nreceive the heightened scrutiny that now attends “all gender-based\nclassifications,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.\nT. B. , 511 U. S. 127 , including laws granting or denying\nbenefits “on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,” Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76 . Prescribing\none rule for mothers, another for fathers, §1409 is of the same\ngenre as the classifications declared unconstitutional in Westcott ; Reed v. Reed , 404 U. S. 71 –77; Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S. 636 –653;\nand Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207. A\nsuccessful defense therefore requires an “ ‘exceedingly\npersuasive justification.’ ” United States v. Virginia , 518 U. S. 515 . Pp. 7–9. (c) The Government must show, at least,\nthat its gender-based “ ‘classification serves “important\ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed”\nare “substantially related to [achieving] those\nobjectives.” ’ ” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533.\nThe classification must serve an important governmental interest today , for “new insights and societal understandings can\nreveal unjustified inequality . . . that once passed\nunnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges ,\n576 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 9–14. (1) At the time §1409 was enacted as part\nof the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), two once habitual, but\nnow untenable, assumptions pervaded the Nation’s citizenship laws\nand underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage,\nhusband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the sole\nguardian of a nonmarital child. In the 1940 Act, Congress codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.\nAccording to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified\nfor unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have\nscant contact with, their nonmarital children. Unwed citizen\nmothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father,\nalong with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.\nPp. 9–13. (2) For close to a half century, this\nCourt has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on “overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533. No “important [governmental] interest” is served by laws\ngrounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that\n“unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than\nmothers” to take responsibility for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441 U. S. 380 . In light of\nthis equal protection jurisprudence, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are\nanachronistic. Pp. 13–14. (d) The Government points to Fiallo v. Bell , 430 U. S. 787 ; Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53 , for support. But Fiallo involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not\npresent a claim of U. S. citizenship. And Miller and Nguyen addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well\nmet here, not the length of a parent’s prebirth residency in the\nUnited States. Pp. 14–16. (e) The Government’s suggested rationales\nfor §1409(a) and (c)’s gender-based differential do not survive\nheightened scrutiny. Pp. 16–23. (1) The Government asserts that Congress\nsought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection\nto the United States. The statute, the Government suggests,\nbracketed an unwed U. S.-citizen mother with a married couple\nin which both parents are U. S. citizens because she is the\nonly legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed\nU. S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a\ncitizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national\ninfluence of the alien mother. This rationale conforms to the\nlong-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.\nAnd the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested\ncongressional interest. Citizenship may be transmitted to children\nwho have no tie to the United States so long as their\nU. S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United\nStates for one year at any point in her life prior to the\nchild’s birth; but it may not be transmitted by a\nU. S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting\n§1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he\nacknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the\nchild in the United States. Pp. 17–19. (2) The Government also maintains that\nCongress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the\nforeign-born child of a U. S. citizen. But congressional\nhearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a\nstatelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence\nrequirements. Nor has the Government shown that the risk of\nstatelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Pp. 19–23. 2. Because this Court is not equipped to\nconvert §1409(c)’s exception for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers\ninto the main rule displacing §§1401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to\nCongress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor\ndisadvantages any person on the basis of gender. In the interim,\n§1401(a)(7)’s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to\nchildren born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. The\nlegislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs\nthe choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending\nfavorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable\ntreatment from the favored class. Ordinarily, the preferred rule is\nto extend favorable treatment. Westcott , 443 U. S., at\n89–90. Here, however, extension to fathers of §1409(c)’s favorable\ntreatment for mothers would displace Congress’ general rule, the\nlonger physical-presence requirements of §§1401(a)(7) and 1409\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers and\nU. S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the\nchild’s alien parent. Congress’ “ ‘commitment to th[is]\nresidual policy’ ” and “ ‘the degree of potential\ndisruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as\nopposed to abrogation,’ ” Heckler v. Mathews ,\n465 U. S. 728 , n. 5, indicate that Congress would likely\nhave abrogated §1409(c)’s special exception, preferring to preserve\n“the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of\ndedicated attachment,” Rogers v. Bellei , 401\nU. S. 815 . Pp. 23–28. 804 F. 3d 520, affirmed in part, reversed\nin part, and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1191 _________________ JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [June 12, 2017] Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case concerns a gender-based differential\nin the law governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a\nchild born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the\nother, a citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in\n8 U. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g)\n(2012 ed.). Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires a\nperiod of physical presence in the United States for the\nU. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially\nprescribed, was ten years’ physical presence prior to the child’s\nbirth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years\nprebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule is rendered\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a).\nCongress ordered an exception, however, for unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c), the exception\nallows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born\nabroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year\nprior to the child’s birth. The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón\nMorales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father\nwas just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)’s physical-presence\nrequirement. Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic,\nMorales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle\nimplicit in the Fifth Amendment[ 1 ] entitles him to citizenship stature. We hold that the\ngender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that\nthe Government accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Nevertheless, we cannot convert §1409(c)’s exception for\nunwed mothers into the main rule displacing §1401(a)(7) (covering\nmarried couples) and §1409(a) (covering unwed fathers). We must\ntherefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a\nphysical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other\nperiod) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one\nU. S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed. In the\ninterim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are\nadministered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination. I A We first describe in greater detail the regime\nCongress constructed. The general rules for acquiring U. S.\ncitizenship are found in 8 U. S. C. §1401, the first\nsection in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (1952 Act or INA), §301, 66Stat. 235–236. Section\n1401 sets forth the INA’s rules for determining who “shall be\nnationals and citizens of the United States at birth” by\nestablishing a range of residency and physical-presence\nrequirements calibrated primarily to the parents’ nationality and\nthe child’s place of birth. §1401(a) (1958 ed.); §1401 (2012 ed.).\nThe primacy of §1401 in the statutory scheme is evident.\nComprehensive in coverage, §1401 provides the general framework for\nthe acquisition of citizenship at birth. In particular, at the time\nrelevant here,[ 2 ] §1401(a)(7)\nprovided for the U. S. citizenship of “a person born outside the geographical\nlimits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents\none of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United\nStates who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically\npresent in the United States or its outlying possessions for a\nperiod or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five\nof which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided , That any periods of honorable service in the Armed\nForces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included\nin computing the physical presence requirements of this\nparagraph.” Congress has since reduced the duration\nrequirement to five years, two after age 14. §1401(g) (2012\ned.).[ 3 ] Section 1409 pertains specifically to children\nwith unmarried parents. Its first subsection, §1409(a),\nincorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of\n§1401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to\ntransmit U. S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the\nsame terms as a married citizen parent. Section 1409(c)—a provision\napplicable only to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers—states an\nexception to the physical-presence requirements of §§1401 and\n1409(a). Under §1409(c)’s exception, only one year of continuous\nphysical presence is required before unwed mothers may pass\ncitizenship to their children born abroad. B Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana moved to\nthe United States at age 13, and has resided in this country most\nof his life. Now facing deportation, he asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biological\nfather, José Morales, who accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household. José Morales was born in Guánica, Puerto Rico,\non March 19, 1900. Record 55–56. Puerto Rico was then, as it is\nnow, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle , 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 2–4); 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (“The term\nUnited States . . . means the continental United States,\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U. S.] Virgin\nIslands.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); §1101(a)(38) (2012\ned.) (similar), and José became a U. S. citizen under the\nOrganic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, §5, 39Stat. 953 (a predecessor\nto 8 U. S. C. §1402). After living in Puerto Rico for\nnearly two decades, José left his childhood home on February 27,\n1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. Record 57, 66. He did so to take up employment as a\nbuilder-mechanic for a U. S. company in the\nthen-U. S.-occupied Dominican Republic. Ibid. [ 4 ] By 1959, José attested in a June 21, 1971\naffidavit presented to the U. S. Embassy in the Dominican\nRepublic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Dominican\nwoman he would eventually marry. Id. , at 57. In 1962, Yrma\ngave birth to their child, respondent Luis Morales-Santana. Id. , at 166–167. While the record before us reveals little\nabout Morales-Santana’s childhood, the Dominican archives disclose\nthat Yrma and José married in 1970, and that José was then added to\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate as his father. Id. , at\n163–164, 167. José also related in the same affidavit that he was\nthen saving money “for the susten[ance] of [his] family” in\nanticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where members of\nhis family still resided. Id. , at 57. In 1975, when\nMorales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico, id. , at\n368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was attending public\nschool in the Bronx, a New York City borough, id. , at 140,\n369.[ 5 ] C In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana\nin removal proceedings based on several convictions for offenses\nunder New York State Penal Law, all of them rendered on May 17,\n1995. Id. , at 426. Morales-Santana ranked as an alien\ndespite the many years he lived in the United States, because, at\nthe time of his birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement\nof five years’ physical presence after age 14. See supra , at\n3–4, and n. 3. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s\nclaim to citizenship derived from the U. S. citizenship of his\nfather, and ordered Morales-Santana’s removal to the Dominican\nRepublic. Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a–49a. In 2010,\nMorales-Santana moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the\nGovernment’s refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from\nhis U. S.-citizen father violated the Constitution’s equal\nprotection guarantee. See Record 27, 45. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) denied the motion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a,\n42a–44a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the BIA’s decision. 804 F. 3d 520, 524\n(2015). Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of the equal\nprotection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications,\nthe court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed\nmothers and fathers. Id. , at 527–535. To cure the\nconstitutional flaw, the court further held that Morales-Santana\nderived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his\nmother the U. S. citizen. Id. , at 535–538. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit declined to follow the conflicting\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Flores-Villar , 536 F. 3d 990 (2008), see 804\nF. 3d, at 530, 535, n. 17. We granted certiorariin Flores-Villar , but ultimately affirmed by an equally divided\nCourt. Flores-Villar v. United States , 564 U. S.\n210 (2011) ( per curiam ). Taking up Morales-Santana’s\nrequest for review, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), we consider the\nmatter anew. II Because §1409 treats sons and daughters alike,\nMorales-Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based\ndiscrimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of\nMorales-Santana’s birth and was not accorded the right an unwed\nU. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her\nchild. Although the Government does not contend otherwise, we\nbriefly explain why Morales-Santana may seek to vindicate his\nfather’s right to the equal protection of the laws.[ 6 ] Ordinarily, a party “must assert his own legal\nrights” and “cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights\n. . . of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin ,\n422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975) . But we recognize an exception\nwhere, as here, “the party asserting the right has a close\nrelationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is\na hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his own\ninterests.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125,\n130 (2004) (quoting Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S.\n400, 411 (1991) ). José Morales’ ability to pass citizenship to his\nson, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies the “close\nrelationship” requirement. So, too, is the “hindrance” requirement\nwell met. José Morales’ failure to assert a claim in his own right\n“stems from disability,” not “disinterest,” Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420, 450 (1998) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), for José died in 1976, Record 140, many\nyears before the current controversy arose. See Hodel v. Irving , 481 U. S. 704 –712, 723, n. 7 (1987)\n(children and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights of\ndeceased relatives). Morales-Santana is thus the “obvious\nclaimant,” see Craig v. Boren , 429 U. S. 190,\n197 (1976) , the “best available proponent,” Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U. S. 106, 116 (1976) , of his father’s\nright to equal protection. III Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an\nera when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. See, e.g. , Hoyt v. Florida , 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961) (women\nare the “center of home and family life,” therefore they can be\n“relieved from the civic duty of jury service”); Goesaert v. Cleary , 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (States may draw “a\nsharp line between the sexes”). Today, laws of this kind are\nsubject to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends\n“all gender-based classifications.” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127, 136 (1994) ; see, e.g. , United States v. Virginia , 518\nU. S. 515 –556 (1996) (state-maintained military academy may\nnot deny admission to qualified women). Laws granting or denying benefits “on the basis\nof the sex of the qualifying parent,” our post-1970 decisions\naffirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore attract\nheightened review under the Constitution’s equal protection\nguarantee. Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76,\n84 (1979) ; see id. , at 88–89 (holding unconstitutional\nprovision of unemployed-parent benefits exclusively to fathers).\nAccord Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207\n(1977) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that denied widowers survivors’ benefits\navailable to widows); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420\nU. S. 636 –653 (1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that excluded fathers from receipt of\nchild-in-care benefits available to mothers); Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691 (1973) (plurality\nopinion) (holding unconstitutional exclusion of married female\nofficers in the military from benefits automatically accorded\nmarried male officers); cf. Reed v. Reed , 404\nU. S. 71 –77 (1971) (holding unconstitutional a probate-code\npreference for a father over a mother as administrator of a\ndeceased child’s estate).[ 7 ] Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for\nfathers, §1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we\ndeclared unconstitutional in Reed , Frontiero , Wiesenfeld , Goldfarb , and Westcott . As in\nthose cases, heightened scrutiny is in order. Successful defense of\nlegislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have\nreiterated, requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Kirchberg v. Feenstra , 450 U. S. 455,\n461 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). A The defender of legislation that\ndifferentiates on the basis of gender must show “at least that the\n[challenged] classification serves important governmental\nobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533 (quoting Mississippi\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan , 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982)\n; alteration in original); see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53, 60, 70 (2001) . Moreover, the\nclassification must substantially serve an important governmental\ninterest today , for “in interpreting the [e]qual\n[p]rotection [guarantee], [we have] recognized that new insights\nand societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality\n. . . that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 20). Here, the Government has supplied no\n“exceedingly persuasive justification,” Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted), for §1409(a)\nand (c)’s “gender-based” and “gender-biased” disparity, Westcott , 443 U. S., at 84 (internalquotation marks\nomitted). 1 History reveals what lurks behind §1409.\nEnacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54Stat.\n1139–1140, §1409 ended a century and a half of congressional\nsilence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed\nparents.[ 8 ] During this era,\ntwo once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our\nNation’s citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and\nadministrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife\nsubordinate; unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a\nnonmarital child. Under the once entrenched principle of male\ndominance in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.\n“[D]ominance [of] the husband,” this Court observed in 1915, “is an\nancient principle of our jurisprudence.” Mackenzie v. Hare , 239 U. S. 299, 311 (1915) .[ 9 ] See generally Brief for Professors of History\net al. as Amici Curiae 4–15. Through the early 20th\ncentury, a male citizen automatically conferred U. S.\ncitizenship on his alien wife. Act of Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, §2,\n10Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen , 7 Wall. 496, 498\n(1869) (the 1855 Act “confers the privileges of citizenship upon\nwomen married to citizens of the United States”); C. Bredbenner, A\nNationality of Her Own:Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship\n15–16, 20–21 (1998). A female citizen, however, was incapable of\nconferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was subject to\nexpatriation if she married an alien.[ 10 ] The family of a citizen or a lawfully admitted\npermanent resident enjoyed statutory exemptions from entry\nrequirements, but only if the citizen or resident was male. See, e.g. , Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §37, 32Stat. 1221\n(wives and children entering the country to join permanent-resident\naliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases during\ntransit shall not be deported if the diseases were easily curable\nor did not present a danger to others); S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st\nCong., 2d Sess., 415–417 (1950) (wives exempt from literacy and\nquota requirements). And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born\nchild of a married couple gained U. S. citizenship only\nthrough the father.[ 11 ] For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition\nnever held sway. Instead, the mother was regarded as the child’s\nnatural and sole guardian. At common law, the mother, and only the\nmother, was “bound to maintain [a nonmarital child] as its natural\nguardian.” 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *215–*216 (8th\ned. 1854); see Nguyen , 533 U. S., at 91–92 (O’Connor,\nJ., dissenting). In line with that understanding, in the early 20th\ncentury, the State Department sometimes permitted unwed mothers to\npass citizenship to their children, despite the absence of any\nstatutory authority for the practice. See Hearings on H. R.\n6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization,\n76th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings);\n39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 397–398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291\n(1939). See also Collins, Illegitimate Borders: Jus\nSanguinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family,\nRace, and Nation, 123 Yale L. J. 2134, 2199–2205 (2014)\n(hereinafter Collins). In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the\nfather-controls assumption concerning married parents, but codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried parents.\nThe Roosevelt administration, which proposed §1409, explained:\n“[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child] stands in the place of the\nfather . . . [,] has a right tothe custody and control of\nsuch a child as against the putative father, and is bound to\nmaintain it as its natu-ral guardian.” 1940 Hearings 431 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion\nrenders §1409’s gender-based residency rules understandable.\nFearing that a foreign-born child could turn out “more alien than\nAmerican in character,” the administration believed that a citizen\nparent with lengthy ties to the United States would counteract the\ninfluence of the alien parent. Id. , at 426–427. Concern\nabout the attachment of foreign-born children to the United States\nexplains the treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to\nthe familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have scant\ncontact with, their nonmarital children. For unwed citizen mothers,\nhowever, there was no need for a prolonged residency prophylactic:\nThe alien father, who might transmit foreign ways, was\npresumptively out of the picture. See id. , at 431; Collins\n2203 (in “nearly uniform view” of U. S. officials, “almost\ninvariably,” the mother alone “concern[ed] herself with [a\nnonmarital] child” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 2 For close to a half century, as earlier\nobserved, see supra , at 7–8, this Court has viewed with\nsuspicion laws that rely on “overbroad generalizations about the\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and\nfemales.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S., at 643, 648. In particular, we\nhave recognized that if a “statutory objective is to exclude or\n‘protect’ members of one gender” in reliance on “fixed notions\nconcerning [that gender’s] roles and abilities,” the “objective\nitself is illegitimate.” Mississippi Univ. for Women , 458\nU. S., at 725. In accord with this eventual understanding, the\nCourt has held that no “important [governmental] interest” is\nserved by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the\nobsolescing view that “unwed fathers [are] invariably less\nqualified and entitled than mothers” to take responsibility for\nnonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441\nU. S. 380, 382, 394 (1979) .[ 12 ] Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court\nhas come to comprehend, have a constraining impact, descriptive\nthough they may be of the way many people still order their\nlives.[ 13 ] Laws according or\ndenying benefits in reliance on “[s]tereotypes about women’s\ndomestic roles,” the Court has observed, may “creat[e] a\nself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that force[s] women to\ncontinue to assume the role of primary family caregiver.” Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721,\n736 (2003) . Correspondingly, such laws may disserve men who\nexercise responsibility for raising their children. See ibid. In light of the equal protection jurisprudence this\nCourt has developed since 1971, see Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531–534, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers\nwho have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly\nanachronistic. B In urging this Court nevertheless to reject\nMorales-Santana’s equal protection plea, the Government cites three\ndecisions of this Court: Fiallo v. Bell , 430\nU. S. 787 (1977) ; Miller v. Albright , 523\nU. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53\n. None controls this case. The 1952 Act provision at issue in Fiallo gave special immigration preferences to alien children of citizen\n(or lawful-permanent-resident) mothers, and to alien unwed mothers\nof citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children. 430 U. S.,\nat 788–789, and n. 1. Unwed fathers and their children,\nasserting their right to equal protection, sought the same\npreferences. Id. , at 791. Applying minimal scrutiny\n(rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on\nCongress’ “exceptionally broad power” to admit or exclude aliens. Id. , at 792, 794.[ 14 ]\nThis case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.\nMorales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a\nU. S. citizen. Examining a claim of that order, the Court has\nnot disclaimed, as it did in Fiallo , the application of an\nexacting standard of review. See Nguyen , 533 U. S., at\n60–61, 70; Miller , 523 U. S., at 434–435, n. ",

Applicable to married\ncouples, the main rule in effect at the time here relevant, 8\nU. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), required the\nU. S.-citizen parent to have ten years’ physical presence in\nthe United States prior to the child’s birth, “at least five of\nwhich were after attaining” age 14. The rule is made applicable to\nunwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a), but §1409(c) creates\nan exception for an unwed U. S.-citizen mother, whose\ncitizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has\nlived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to\nthe child’s birth. Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana, who has\nlived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the U. S. citizenship of his\nbiological father, José Morales. José moved to the Dominican\nRepublic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave\nbirth to Morales-Santana. José accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household; he married\nMorales-Santana’s mother and his name was then added to hers on\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate. In 2000, the Government sought\nto remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions,\nranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did\nnot satisfy the requirement of five years’ physical presence after\nage 14. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s citizenship\nclaim and ordered his removal. Morales-Santana later moved to\nreopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government’s refusal to\nrecognize that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen\nfather violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. The\nBoard of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of\nthe equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based\nclassifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential\ntreatment of unwed mothers and fathers. To cure this infirmity, the\nCourt of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship\nthrough his father, just as he would were his mother the U. S.\ncitizen. Held : 1. The gender line Congress drew is\nincompatible with the Fifth Amendment’s requirement that the\nGovernment accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Pp. 6–23. (a) Morales-Santana satisfies the\nrequirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his\nfather’s right to equal protection. José Morales’ ability to pass\ncitizenship to his son easily satisfies the requirement that the\nthird party have a “ ‘close’ relationship with the person who\npossesses the right.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543\nU. S. 125 . And José’s death many years before the current\ncontroversy arose is “a ‘hindrance’ to [José’s] ability to protect\nhis own interests.” Ibid. Pp. 6–7. (b) Sections 1401 and 1409 date from an\nera when the Nation’s lawbooks were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. Today, such laws\nreceive the heightened scrutiny that now attends “all gender-based\nclassifications,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.\nT. B. , 511 U. S. 127 , including laws granting or denying\nbenefits “on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,” Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76 . Prescribing\none rule for mothers, another for fathers, §1409 is of the same\ngenre as the classifications declared unconstitutional in Westcott ; Reed v. Reed , 404 U. S. 71 –77; Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S. 636 –653;\nand Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207. A\nsuccessful defense therefore requires an “ ‘exceedingly\npersuasive justification.’ ” United States v. Virginia , 518 U. S. 515 . Pp. 7–9. (c) The Government must show, at least,\nthat its gender-based “ ‘classification serves “important\ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed”\nare “substantially related to [achieving] those\nobjectives.” ’ ” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533.\nThe classification must serve an important governmental interest today , for “new insights and societal understandings can\nreveal unjustified inequality . . . that once passed\nunnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges ,\n576 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 9–14. (1) At the time §1409 was enacted as part\nof the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), two once habitual, but\nnow untenable, assumptions pervaded the Nation’s citizenship laws\nand underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage,\nhusband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the sole\nguardian of a nonmarital child. In the 1940 Act, Congress codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.\nAccording to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified\nfor unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have\nscant contact with, their nonmarital children. Unwed citizen\nmothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father,\nalong with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.\nPp. 9–13. (2) For close to a half century, this\nCourt has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on “overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533. No “important [governmental] interest” is served by laws\ngrounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that\n“unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than\nmothers” to take responsibility for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441 U. S. 380 . In light of\nthis equal protection jurisprudence, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are\nanachronistic. Pp. 13–14. (d) The Government points to Fiallo v. Bell , 430 U. S. 787 ; Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53 , for support. But Fiallo involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not\npresent a claim of U. S. citizenship. And Miller and Nguyen addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well\nmet here, not the length of a parent’s prebirth residency in the\nUnited States. Pp. 14–16. (e) The Government’s suggested rationales\nfor §1409(a) and (c)’s gender-based differential do not survive\nheightened scrutiny. Pp. 16–23. (1) The Government asserts that Congress\nsought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection\nto the United States. The statute, the Government suggests,\nbracketed an unwed U. S.-citizen mother with a married couple\nin which both parents are U. S. citizens because she is the\nonly legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed\nU. S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a\ncitizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national\ninfluence of the alien mother. This rationale conforms to the\nlong-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.\nAnd the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested\ncongressional interest. Citizenship may be transmitted to children\nwho have no tie to the United States so long as their\nU. S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United\nStates for one year at any point in her life prior to the\nchild’s birth; but it may not be transmitted by a\nU. S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting\n§1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he\nacknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the\nchild in the United States. Pp. 17–19. (2) The Government also maintains that\nCongress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the\nforeign-born child of a U. S. citizen. But congressional\nhearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a\nstatelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence\nrequirements. Nor has the Government shown that the risk of\nstatelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Pp. 19–23. 2. Because this Court is not equipped to\nconvert §1409(c)’s exception for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers\ninto the main rule displacing §§1401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to\nCongress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor\ndisadvantages any person on the basis of gender. In the interim,\n§1401(a)(7)’s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to\nchildren born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. The\nlegislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs\nthe choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending\nfavorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable\ntreatment from the favored class. Ordinarily, the preferred rule is\nto extend favorable treatment. Westcott , 443 U. S., at\n89–90. Here, however, extension to fathers of §1409(c)’s favorable\ntreatment for mothers would displace Congress’ general rule, the\nlonger physical-presence requirements of §§1401(a)(7) and 1409\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers and\nU. S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the\nchild’s alien parent. Congress’ “ ‘commitment to th[is]\nresidual policy’ ” and “ ‘the degree of potential\ndisruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as\nopposed to abrogation,’ ” Heckler v. Mathews ,\n465 U. S. 728 , n. 5, indicate that Congress would likely\nhave abrogated §1409(c)’s special exception, preferring to preserve\n“the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of\ndedicated attachment,” Rogers v. Bellei , 401\nU. S. 815 . Pp. 23–28. 804 F. 3d 520, affirmed in part, reversed\nin part, and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed an opinion\nconcurring in the judgment in part, in which Alito, J., joined.\nGorsuch, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the\ncase.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1191 _________________ JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [June 12, 2017] Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case concerns a gender-based differential\nin the law governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a\nchild born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the\nother, a citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in\n8 U. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g)\n(2012 ed.). Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires a\nperiod of physical presence in the United States for the\nU. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially\nprescribed, was ten years’ physical presence prior to the child’s\nbirth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years\nprebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule is rendered\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a).\nCongress ordered an exception, however, for unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c), the exception\nallows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born\nabroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year\nprior to the child’s birth. The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón\nMorales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father\nwas just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)’s physical-presence\nrequirement. Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic,\nMorales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle\nimplicit in the Fifth Amendment[ 1 ] entitles him to citizenship stature. We hold that the\ngender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that\nthe Government accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Nevertheless, we cannot convert §1409(c)’s exception for\nunwed mothers into the main rule displacing §1401(a)(7) (covering\nmarried couples) and §1409(a) (covering unwed fathers). We must\ntherefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a\nphysical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other\nperiod) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one\nU. S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed. In the\ninterim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are\nadministered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination. I A We first describe in greater detail the regime\nCongress constructed. The general rules for acquiring U. S.\ncitizenship are found in 8 U. S. C. §1401, the first\nsection in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (1952 Act or INA), §301, 66Stat. 235–236. Section\n1401 sets forth the INA’s rules for determining who “shall be\nnationals and citizens of the United States at birth” by\nestablishing a range of residency and physical-presence\nrequirements calibrated primarily to the parents’ nationality and\nthe child’s place of birth. §1401(a) (1958 ed.); §1401 (2012 ed.).\nThe primacy of §1401 in the statutory scheme is evident.\nComprehensive in coverage, §1401 provides the general framework for\nthe acquisition of citizenship at birth. In particular, at the time\nrelevant here,[ 2 ] §1401(a)(7)\nprovided for the U. S. citizenship of “a person born outside the geographical\nlimits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents\none of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United\nStates who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically\npresent in the United States or its outlying possessions for a\nperiod or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five\nof which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided , That any periods of honorable service in the Armed\nForces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included\nin computing the physical presence requirements of this\nparagraph.” Congress has since reduced the duration\nrequirement to five years, two after age 14. §1401(g) (2012\ned.).[ 3 ] Section 1409 pertains specifically to children\nwith unmarried parents. Its first subsection, §1409(a),\nincorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of\n§1401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to\ntransmit U. S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the\nsame terms as a married citizen parent. Section 1409(c)—a provision\napplicable only to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers—states an\nexception to the physical-presence requirements of §§1401 and\n1409(a). Under §1409(c)’s exception, only one year of continuous\nphysical presence is required before unwed mothers may pass\ncitizenship to their children born abroad. B Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana moved to\nthe United States at age 13, and has resided in this country most\nof his life. Now facing deportation, he asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biological\nfather, José Morales, who accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household. José Morales was born in Guánica, Puerto Rico,\non March 19, 1900. Record 55–56. Puerto Rico was then, as it is\nnow, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle , 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 2–4); 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (“The term\nUnited States . . . means the continental United States,\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U. S.] Virgin\nIslands.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); §1101(a)(38) (2012\ned.) (similar), and José became a U. S. citizen under the\nOrganic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, §5, 39Stat. 953 (a predecessor\nto 8 U. S. C. §1402). After living in Puerto Rico for\nnearly two decades, José left his childhood home on February 27,\n1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. Record 57, 66. He did so to take up employment as a\nbuilder-mechanic for a U. S. company in the\nthen-U. S.-occupied Dominican Republic. Ibid. [ 4 ] By 1959, José attested in a June 21, 1971\naffidavit presented to the U. S. Embassy in the Dominican\nRepublic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Dominican\nwoman he would eventually marry. Id. , at 57. In 1962, Yrma\ngave birth to their child, respondent Luis Morales-Santana. Id. , at 166–167. While the record before us reveals little\nabout Morales-Santana’s childhood, the Dominican archives disclose\nthat Yrma and José married in 1970, and that José was then added to\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate as his father. Id. , at\n163–164, 167. José also related in the same affidavit that he was\nthen saving money “for the susten[ance] of [his] family” in\nanticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where members of\nhis family still resided. Id. , at 57. In 1975, when\nMorales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico, id. , at\n368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was attending public\nschool in the Bronx, a New York City borough, id. , at 140,\n369.[ 5 ] C In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana\nin removal proceedings based on several convictions for offenses\nunder New York State Penal Law, all of them rendered on May 17,\n1995. Id. , at 426. Morales-Santana ranked as an alien\ndespite the many years he lived in the United States, because, at\nthe time of his birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement\nof five years’ physical presence after age 14. See supra , at\n3–4, and n. 3. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s\nclaim to citizenship derived from the U. S. citizenship of his\nfather, and ordered Morales-Santana’s removal to the Dominican\nRepublic. Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a–49a. In 2010,\nMorales-Santana moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the\nGovernment’s refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from\nhis U. S.-citizen father violated the Constitution’s equal\nprotection guarantee. See Record 27, 45. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) denied the motion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a,\n42a–44a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the BIA’s decision. 804 F. 3d 520, 524\n(2015). Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of the equal\nprotection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications,\nthe court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed\nmothers and fathers. Id. , at 527–535. To cure the\nconstitutional flaw, the court further held that Morales-Santana\nderived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his\nmother the U. S. citizen. Id. , at 535–538. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit declined to follow the conflicting\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Flores-Villar , 536 F. 3d 990 (2008), see 804\nF. 3d, at 530, 535, n. 17. We granted certiorariin Flores-Villar , but ultimately affirmed by an equally divided\nCourt. Flores-Villar v. United States , 564 U. S.\n210 (2011) ( per curiam ). Taking up Morales-Santana’s\nrequest for review, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), we consider the\nmatter anew. II Because §1409 treats sons and daughters alike,\nMorales-Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based\ndiscrimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of\nMorales-Santana’s birth and was not accorded the right an unwed\nU. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her\nchild. Although the Government does not contend otherwise, we\nbriefly explain why Morales-Santana may seek to vindicate his\nfather’s right to the equal protection of the laws.[ 6 ] Ordinarily, a party “must assert his own legal\nrights” and “cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights\n. . . of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin ,\n422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975) . But we recognize an exception\nwhere, as here, “the party asserting the right has a close\nrelationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is\na hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his own\ninterests.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125,\n130 (2004) (quoting Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S.\n400, 411 (1991) ). José Morales’ ability to pass citizenship to his\nson, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies the “close\nrelationship” requirement. So, too, is the “hindrance” requirement\nwell met. José Morales’ failure to assert a claim in his own right\n“stems from disability,” not “disinterest,” Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420, 450 (1998) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), for José died in 1976, Record 140, many\nyears before the current controversy arose. See Hodel v. Irving , 481 U. S. 704 –712, 723, n. 7 (1987)\n(children and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights of\ndeceased relatives). Morales-Santana is thus the “obvious\nclaimant,” see Craig v. Boren , 429 U. S. 190,\n197 (1976) , the “best available proponent,” Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U. S. 106, 116 (1976) , of his father’s\nright to equal protection. III Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an\nera when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. See, e.g. , Hoyt v. Florida , 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961) (women\nare the “center of home and family life,” therefore they can be\n“relieved from the civic duty of jury service”); Goesaert v. Cleary , 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (States may draw “a\nsharp line between the sexes”). Today, laws of this kind are\nsubject to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends\n“all gender-based classifications.” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127, 136 (1994) ; see, e.g. , United States v. Virginia , 518\nU. S. 515 –556 (1996) (state-maintained military academy may\nnot deny admission to qualified women). Laws granting or denying benefits “on the basis\nof the sex of the qualifying parent,” our post-1970 decisions\naffirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore attract\nheightened review under the Constitution’s equal protection\nguarantee. Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76,\n84 (1979) ; see id. , at 88–89 (holding unconstitutional\nprovision of unemployed-parent benefits exclusively to fathers).\nAccord Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207\n(1977) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that denied widowers survivors’ benefits\navailable to widows); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420\nU. S. 636 –653 (1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that excluded fathers from receipt of\nchild-in-care benefits available to mothers); Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691 (1973) (plurality\nopinion) (holding unconstitutional exclusion of married female\nofficers in the military from benefits automatically accorded\nmarried male officers); cf. Reed v. Reed , 404\nU. S. 71 –77 (1971) (holding unconstitutional a probate-code\npreference for a father over a mother as administrator of a\ndeceased child’s estate).[ 7 ] Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for\nfathers, §1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we\ndeclared unconstitutional in Reed , Frontiero , Wiesenfeld , Goldfarb , and Westcott . As in\nthose cases, heightened scrutiny is in order. Successful defense of\nlegislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have\nreiterated, requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Kirchberg v. Feenstra , 450 U. S. 455,\n461 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). A The defender of legislation that\ndifferentiates on the basis of gender must show “at least that the\n[challenged] classification serves important governmental\nobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533 (quoting Mississippi\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan , 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982)\n; alteration in original); see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53, 60, 70 (2001) . Moreover, the\nclassification must substantially serve an important governmental\ninterest today , for “in interpreting the [e]qual\n[p]rotection [guarantee], [we have] recognized that new insights\nand societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality\n. . . that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 20). Here, the Government has supplied no\n“exceedingly persuasive justification,” Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted), for §1409(a)\nand (c)’s “gender-based” and “gender-biased” disparity, Westcott , 443 U. S., at 84 (internalquotation marks\nomitted). 1 History reveals what lurks behind §1409.\nEnacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54Stat.\n1139–1140, §1409 ended a century and a half of congressional\nsilence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed\nparents.[ 8 ] During this era,\ntwo once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our\nNation’s citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and\nadministrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife\nsubordinate; unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a\nnonmarital child. Under the once entrenched principle of male\ndominance in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.\n“[D]ominance [of] the husband,” this Court observed in 1915, “is an\nancient principle of our jurisprudence.” Mackenzie v. Hare , 239 U. S. 299, 311 (1915) .[ 9 ] See generally Brief for Professors of History\net al. as Amici Curiae 4–15. Through the early 20th\ncentury, a male citizen automatically conferred U. S.\ncitizenship on his alien wife. Act of Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, §2,\n10Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen , 7 Wall. 496, 498\n(1869) (the 1855 Act “confers the privileges of citizenship upon\nwomen married to citizens of the United States”); C. Bredbenner, A\nNationality of Her Own:Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship\n15–16, 20–21 (1998). A female citizen, however, was incapable of\nconferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was subject to\nexpatriation if she married an alien.[ 10 ] The family of a citizen or a lawfully admitted\npermanent resident enjoyed statutory exemptions from entry\nrequirements, but only if the citizen or resident was male. See, e.g. , Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §37, 32Stat. 1221\n(wives and children entering the country to join permanent-resident\naliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases during\ntransit shall not be deported if the diseases were easily curable\nor did not present a danger to others); S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st\nCong., 2d Sess., 415–417 (1950) (wives exempt from literacy and\nquota requirements). And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born\nchild of a married couple gained U. S. citizenship only\nthrough the father.[ 11 ] For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition\nnever held sway. Instead, the mother was regarded as the child’s\nnatural and sole guardian. At common law, the mother, and only the\nmother, was “bound to maintain [a nonmarital child] as its natural\nguardian.” 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *215–*216 (8th\ned. 1854); see Nguyen , 533 U. S., at 91–92 (O’Connor,\nJ., dissenting). In line with that understanding, in the early 20th\ncentury, the State Department sometimes permitted unwed mothers to\npass citizenship to their children, despite the absence of any\nstatutory authority for the practice. See Hearings on H. R.\n6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization,\n76th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings);\n39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 397–398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291\n(1939). See also Collins, Illegitimate Borders: Jus\nSanguinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family,\nRace, and Nation, 123 Yale L. J. 2134, 2199–2205 (2014)\n(hereinafter Collins). In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the\nfather-controls assumption concerning married parents, but codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried parents.\nThe Roosevelt administration, which proposed §1409, explained:\n“[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child] stands in the place of the\nfather . . . [,] has a right tothe custody and control of\nsuch a child as against the putative father, and is bound to\nmaintain it as its natu-ral guardian.” 1940 Hearings 431 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion\nrenders §1409’s gender-based residency rules understandable.\nFearing that a foreign-born child could turn out “more alien than\nAmerican in character,” the administration believed that a citizen\nparent with lengthy ties to the United States would counteract the\ninfluence of the alien parent. Id. , at 426–427. Concern\nabout the attachment of foreign-born children to the United States\nexplains the treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to\nthe familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have scant\ncontact with, their nonmarital children. For unwed citizen mothers,\nhowever, there was no need for a prolonged residency prophylactic:\nThe alien father, who might transmit foreign ways, was\npresumptively out of the picture. See id. , at 431; Collins\n2203 (in “nearly uniform view” of U. S. officials, “almost\ninvariably,” the mother alone “concern[ed] herself with [a\nnonmarital] child” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 2 For close to a half century, as earlier\nobserved, see supra , at 7–8, this Court has viewed with\nsuspicion laws that rely on “overbroad generalizations about the\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and\nfemales.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S., at 643, 648. In particular, we\nhave recognized that if a “statutory objective is to exclude or\n‘protect’ members of one gender” in reliance on “fixed notions\nconcerning [that gender’s] roles and abilities,” the “objective\nitself is illegitimate.” Mississippi Univ. for Women , 458\nU. S., at 725. In accord with this eventual understanding, the\nCourt has held that no “important [governmental] interest” is\nserved by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the\nobsolescing view that “unwed fathers [are] invariably less\nqualified and entitled than mothers” to take responsibility for\nnonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441\nU. S. 380, 382, 394 (1979) .[ 12 ] Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court\nhas come to comprehend, have a constraining impact, descriptive\nthough they may be of the way many people still order their\nlives.[ 13 ] Laws according or\ndenying benefits in reliance on “[s]tereotypes about women’s\ndomestic roles,” the Court has observed, may “creat[e] a\nself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that force[s] women to\ncontinue to assume the role of primary family caregiver.” Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721,\n736 (2003) . Correspondingly, such laws may disserve men who\nexercise responsibility for raising their children. See ibid. In light of the equal protection jurisprudence this\nCourt has developed since 1971, see Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531–534, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers\nwho have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly\nanachronistic. B In urging this Court nevertheless to reject\nMorales-Santana’s equal protection plea, the Government cites three\ndecisions of this Court: Fiallo v. Bell , 430\nU. S. 787 (1977) ; Miller v. Albright , 523\nU. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53\n. None controls this case. The 1952 Act provision at issue in Fiallo gave special immigration preferences to alien children of citizen\n(or lawful-permanent-resident) mothers, and to alien unwed mothers\nof citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children. 430 U. S.,\nat 788–789, and n. 1. Unwed fathers and their children,\nasserting their right to equal protection, sought the same\npreferences. Id. , at 791. Applying minimal scrutiny\n(rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on\nCongress’ “exceptionally broad power” to admit or exclude aliens. Id. , at 792, 794.[ 14 ]\nThis case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.\nMorales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a\nU. S. citizen. Examining a claim of that order, the Court has\nnot disclaimed, as it did in Fiallo , the application of an\nexacting standard of review. See Nguyen , 533 U. S., at\n60–61, 70; Miller , 523 U. S., at 434–435, n. ",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL v .\nMORALES-SANTANA certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit No. 15–1191. Argued November 9, 2016—Decided\nJune 12, 2017 The Immigration and Nationality Act provides\nthe framework for acquisition of U. S. citizenship from birth\nby a child born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen and\nthe other a citizen of another nation. Applicable to married\ncouples, the main rule in effect at the time here relevant, 8\nU. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), required the\nU. S.-citizen parent to have ten years’ physical presence in\nthe United States prior to the child’s birth, “at least five of\nwhich were after attaining” age 14. The rule is made applicable to\nunwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a), but §1409(c) creates\nan exception for an unwed U. S.-citizen mother, whose\ncitizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has\nlived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to\nthe child’s birth. Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana, who has\nlived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the U. S. citizenship of his\nbiological father, José Morales. José moved to the Dominican\nRepublic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave\nbirth to Morales-Santana. José accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household; he married\nMorales-Santana’s mother and his name was then added to hers on\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate. In 2000, the Government sought\nto remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions,\nranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did\nnot satisfy the requirement of five years’ physical presence after\nage 14. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s citizenship\nclaim and ordered his removal. Morales-Santana later moved to\nreopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government’s refusal to\nrecognize that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen\nfather violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. The\nBoard of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of\nthe equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based\nclassifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential\ntreatment of unwed mothers and fathers. To cure this infirmity, the\nCourt of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship\nthrough his father, just as he would were his mother the U. S.\ncitizen. Held : 1. The gender line Congress drew is\nincompatible with the Fifth Amendment’s requirement that the\nGovernment accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Pp. 6–23. (a) Morales-Santana satisfies the\nrequirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his\nfather’s right to equal protection. José Morales’ ability to pass\ncitizenship to his son easily satisfies the requirement that the\nthird party have a “ ‘close’ relationship with the person who\npossesses the right.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543\nU. S. 125 . And José’s death many years before the current\ncontroversy arose is “a ‘hindrance’ to [José’s] ability to protect\nhis own interests.” Ibid. Pp. 6–7. (b) Sections 1401 and 1409 date from an\nera when the Nation’s lawbooks were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. Today, such laws\nreceive the heightened scrutiny that now attends “all gender-based\nclassifications,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.\nT. B. , 511 U. S. 127 , including laws granting or denying\nbenefits “on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,” Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76 . Prescribing\none rule for mothers, another for fathers, §1409 is of the same\ngenre as the classifications declared unconstitutional in Westcott ; Reed v. Reed , 404 U. S. 71 –77; Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S. 636 –653;\nand Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207. A\nsuccessful defense therefore requires an “ ‘exceedingly\npersuasive justification.’ ” United States v. Virginia , 518 U. S. 515 . Pp. 7–9. (c) The Government must show, at least,\nthat its gender-based “ ‘classification serves “important\ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed”\nare “substantially related to [achieving] those\nobjectives.” ’ ” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533.\nThe classification must serve an important governmental interest today , for “new insights and societal understandings can\nreveal unjustified inequality . . . that once passed\nunnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges ,\n576 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 9–14. (1) At the time §1409 was enacted as part\nof the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), two once habitual, but\nnow untenable, assumptions pervaded the Nation’s citizenship laws\nand underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage,\nhusband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the sole\nguardian of a nonmarital child. In the 1940 Act, Congress codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.\nAccording to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified\nfor unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have\nscant contact with, their nonmarital children. Unwed citizen\nmothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father,\nalong with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.\nPp. 9–13. (2) For close to a half century, this\nCourt has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on “overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533. No “important [governmental] interest” is served by laws\ngrounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that\n“unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than\nmothers” to take responsibility for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441 U. S. 380 . In light of\nthis equal protection jurisprudence, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are\nanachronistic. Pp. 13–14. (d) The Government points to Fiallo v. Bell , 430 U. S. 787 ; Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53 , for support. But Fiallo involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not\npresent a claim of U. S. citizenship. And Miller and Nguyen addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well\nmet here, not the length of a parent’s prebirth residency in the\nUnited States. Pp. 14–16. (e) The Government’s suggested rationales\nfor §1409(a) and (c)’s gender-based differential do not survive\nheightened scrutiny. Pp. 16–23. (1) The Government asserts that Congress\nsought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection\nto the United States. The statute, the Government suggests,\nbracketed an unwed U. S.-citizen mother with a married couple\nin which both parents are U. S. citizens because she is the\nonly legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed\nU. S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a\ncitizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national\ninfluence of the alien mother. This rationale conforms to the\nlong-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.\nAnd the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested\ncongressional interest. Citizenship may be transmitted to children\nwho have no tie to the United States so long as their\nU. S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United\nStates for one year at any point in her life prior to the\nchild’s birth; but it may not be transmitted by a\nU. S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting\n§1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he\nacknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the\nchild in the United States. Pp. 17–19. (2) The Government also maintains that\nCongress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the\nforeign-born child of a U. S. citizen. But congressional\nhearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a\nstatelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence\nrequirements. Nor has the Government shown that the risk of\nstatelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Pp. 19–23. 2. Because this Court is not equipped to\nconvert §1409(c)’s exception for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers\ninto the main rule displacing §§1401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to\nCongress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor\ndisadvantages any person on the basis of gender. In the interim,\n§1401(a)(7)’s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to\nchildren born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. The\nlegislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs\nthe choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending\nfavorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable\ntreatment from the favored class. Ordinarily, the preferred rule is\nto extend favorable treatment. Westcott , 443 U. S., at\n89–90. Here, however, extension to fathers of §1409(c)’s favorable\ntreatment for mothers would displace Congress’ general rule, the\nlonger physical-presence requirements of §§1401(a)(7) and 1409\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers and\nU. S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the\nchild’s alien parent. Congress’ “ ‘commitment to th[is]\nresidual policy’ ” and “ ‘the degree of potential\ndisruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as\nopposed to abrogation,’ ” Heckler v. Mathews ,\n465 U. S. 728 , n. 5, indicate that Congress would likely\nhave abrogated §1409(c)’s special exception, preferring to preserve\n“the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of\ndedicated attachment,” Rogers v. Bellei , 401\nU. S. 815 . Pp. 23–28. 804 F. 3d 520, affirmed in part, reversed\nin part, and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed an opinion\nconcurring in the judgment in part, in which Alito, J., joined.\nGorsuch, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the\ncase.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1191 _________________ JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [June 12, 2017] Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case concerns a gender-based differential\nin the law governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a\nchild born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the\nother, a citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in\n8 U. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g)\n(2012 ed.). Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires a\nperiod of physical presence in the United States for the\nU. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially\nprescribed, was ten years’ physical presence prior to the child’s\nbirth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years\nprebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule is rendered\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a).\nCongress ordered an exception, however, for unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c), the exception\nallows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born\nabroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year\nprior to the child’s birth. The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón\nMorales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father\nwas just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)’s physical-presence\nrequirement. Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic,\nMorales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle\nimplicit in the Fifth Amendment[ 1 ] entitles him to citizenship stature. We hold that the\ngender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that\nthe Government accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Nevertheless, we cannot convert §1409(c)’s exception for\nunwed mothers into the main rule displacing §1401(a)(7) (covering\nmarried couples) and §1409(a) (covering unwed fathers). We must\ntherefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a\nphysical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other\nperiod) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one\nU. S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed. In the\ninterim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are\nadministered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination. I A We first describe in greater detail the regime\nCongress constructed. The general rules for acquiring U. S.\ncitizenship are found in 8 U. S. C. §1401, the first\nsection in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (1952 Act or INA), §301, 66Stat. 235–236. Section\n1401 sets forth the INA’s rules for determining who “shall be\nnationals and citizens of the United States at birth” by\nestablishing a range of residency and physical-presence\nrequirements calibrated primarily to the parents’ nationality and\nthe child’s place of birth. §1401(a) (1958 ed.); §1401 (2012 ed.).\nThe primacy of §1401 in the statutory scheme is evident.\nComprehensive in coverage, §1401 provides the general framework for\nthe acquisition of citizenship at birth. In particular, at the time\nrelevant here,[ 2 ] §1401(a)(7)\nprovided for the U. S. citizenship of “a person born outside the geographical\nlimits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents\none of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United\nStates who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically\npresent in the United States or its outlying possessions for a\nperiod or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five\nof which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided , That any periods of honorable service in the Armed\nForces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included\nin computing the physical presence requirements of this\nparagraph.” Congress has since reduced the duration\nrequirement to five years, two after age 14. §1401(g) (2012\ned.).[ 3 ] Section 1409 pertains specifically to children\nwith unmarried parents. Its first subsection, §1409(a),\nincorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of\n§1401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to\ntransmit U. S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the\nsame terms as a married citizen parent. Section 1409(c)—a provision\napplicable only to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers—states an\nexception to the physical-presence requirements of §§1401 and\n1409(a). Under §1409(c)’s exception, only one year of continuous\nphysical presence is required before unwed mothers may pass\ncitizenship to their children born abroad. B Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana moved to\nthe United States at age 13, and has resided in this country most\nof his life. Now facing deportation, he asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biological\nfather, José Morales, who accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household. José Morales was born in Guánica, Puerto Rico,\non March 19, 1900. Record 55–56. Puerto Rico was then, as it is\nnow, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle , 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 2–4); 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (“The term\nUnited States . . . means the continental United States,\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U. S.] Virgin\nIslands.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); §1101(a)(38) (2012\ned.) (similar), and José became a U. S. citizen under the\nOrganic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, §5, 39Stat. 953 (a predecessor\nto 8 U. S. C. §1402). After living in Puerto Rico for\nnearly two decades, José left his childhood home on February 27,\n1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. Record 57, 66. He did so to take up employment as a\nbuilder-mechanic for a U. S. company in the\nthen-U. S.-occupied Dominican Republic. Ibid. [ 4 ] By 1959, José attested in a June 21, 1971\naffidavit presented to the U. S. Embassy in the Dominican\nRepublic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Dominican\nwoman he would eventually marry. Id. , at 57. In 1962, Yrma\ngave birth to their child, respondent Luis Morales-Santana. Id. , at 166–167. While the record before us reveals little\nabout Morales-Santana’s childhood, the Dominican archives disclose\nthat Yrma and José married in 1970, and that José was then added to\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate as his father. Id. , at\n163–164, 167. José also related in the same affidavit that he was\nthen saving money “for the susten[ance] of [his] family” in\nanticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where members of\nhis family still resided. Id. , at 57. In 1975, when\nMorales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico, id. , at\n368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was attending public\nschool in the Bronx, a New York City borough, id. , at 140,\n369.[ 5 ] C In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana\nin removal proceedings based on several convictions for offenses\nunder New York State Penal Law, all of them rendered on May 17,\n1995. Id. , at 426. Morales-Santana ranked as an alien\ndespite the many years he lived in the United States, because, at\nthe time of his birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement\nof five years’ physical presence after age 14. See supra , at\n3–4, and n. 3. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s\nclaim to citizenship derived from the U. S. citizenship of his\nfather, and ordered Morales-Santana’s removal to the Dominican\nRepublic. Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a–49a. In 2010,\nMorales-Santana moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the\nGovernment’s refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from\nhis U. S.-citizen father violated the Constitution’s equal\nprotection guarantee. See Record 27, 45. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) denied the motion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a,\n42a–44a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the BIA’s decision. 804 F. 3d 520, 524\n(2015). Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of the equal\nprotection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications,\nthe court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed\nmothers and fathers. Id. , at 527–535. To cure the\nconstitutional flaw, the court further held that Morales-Santana\nderived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his\nmother the U. S. citizen. Id. , at 535–538. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit declined to follow the conflicting\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Flores-Villar , 536 F. 3d 990 (2008), see 804\nF. 3d, at 530, 535, n. 17. We granted certiorariin Flores-Villar , but ultimately affirmed by an equally divided\nCourt. Flores-Villar v. United States , 564 U. S.\n210 (2011) ( per curiam ). Taking up Morales-Santana’s\nrequest for review, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), we consider the\nmatter anew. II Because §1409 treats sons and daughters alike,\nMorales-Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based\ndiscrimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of\nMorales-Santana’s birth and was not accorded the right an unwed\nU. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her\nchild. Although the Government does not contend otherwise, we\nbriefly explain why Morales-Santana may seek to vindicate his\nfather’s right to the equal protection of the laws.[ 6 ] Ordinarily, a party “must assert his own legal\nrights” and “cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights\n. . . of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin ,\n422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975) . But we recognize an exception\nwhere, as here, “the party asserting the right has a close\nrelationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is\na hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his own\ninterests.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125,\n130 (2004) (quoting Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S.\n400, 411 (1991) ). José Morales’ ability to pass citizenship to his\nson, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies the “close\nrelationship” requirement. So, too, is the “hindrance” requirement\nwell met. José Morales’ failure to assert a claim in his own right\n“stems from disability,” not “disinterest,” Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420, 450 (1998) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), for José died in 1976, Record 140, many\nyears before the current controversy arose. See Hodel v. Irving , 481 U. S. 704 –712, 723, n. 7 (1987)\n(children and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights of\ndeceased relatives). Morales-Santana is thus the “obvious\nclaimant,” see Craig v. Boren , 429 U. S. 190,\n197 (1976) , the “best available proponent,” Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U. S. 106, 116 (1976) , of his father’s\nright to equal protection. III Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an\nera when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. See, e.g. , Hoyt v. Florida , 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961) (women\nare the “center of home and family life,” therefore they can be\n“relieved from the civic duty of jury service”); Goesaert v. Cleary , 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (States may draw “a\nsharp line between the sexes”). Today, laws of this kind are\nsubject to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends\n“all gender-based classifications.” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127, 136 (1994) ; see, e.g. , United States v. Virginia , 518\nU. S. 515 –556 (1996) (state-maintained military academy may\nnot deny admission to qualified women). Laws granting or denying benefits “on the basis\nof the sex of the qualifying parent,” our post-1970 decisions\naffirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore attract\nheightened review under the Constitution’s equal protection\nguarantee. Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76,\n84 (1979) ; see id. , at 88–89 (holding unconstitutional\nprovision of unemployed-parent benefits exclusively to fathers).\nAccord Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207\n(1977) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that denied widowers survivors’ benefits\navailable to widows); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420\nU. S. 636 –653 (1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that excluded fathers from receipt of\nchild-in-care benefits available to mothers); Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691 (1973) (plurality\nopinion) (holding unconstitutional exclusion of married female\nofficers in the military from benefits automatically accorded\nmarried male officers); cf. Reed v. Reed , 404\nU. S. 71 –77 (1971) (holding unconstitutional a probate-code\npreference for a father over a mother as administrator of a\ndeceased child’s estate).[ 7 ] Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for\nfathers, §1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we\ndeclared unconstitutional in Reed , Frontiero , Wiesenfeld , Goldfarb , and Westcott . As in\nthose cases, heightened scrutiny is in order. Successful defense of\nlegislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have\nreiterated, requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Kirchberg v. Feenstra , 450 U. S. 455,\n461 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). A The defender of legislation that\ndifferentiates on the basis of gender must show “at least that the\n[challenged] classification serves important governmental\nobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533 (quoting Mississippi\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan , 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982)\n; alteration in original); see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53, 60, 70 (2001) . Moreover, the\nclassification must substantially serve an important governmental\ninterest today , for “in interpreting the [e]qual\n[p]rotection [guarantee], [we have] recognized that new insights\nand societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality\n. . . that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 20). Here, the Government has supplied no\n“exceedingly persuasive justification,” Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted), for §1409(a)\nand (c)’s “gender-based” and “gender-biased” disparity, Westcott , 443 U. S., at 84 (internalquotation marks\nomitted). 1 History reveals what lurks behind §1409.\nEnacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54Stat.\n1139–1140, §1409 ended a century and a half of congressional\nsilence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed\nparents.[ 8 ] During this era,\ntwo once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our\nNation’s citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and\nadministrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife\nsubordinate; unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a\nnonmarital child. Under the once entrenched principle of male\ndominance in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.\n“[D]ominance [of] the husband,” this Court observed in 1915, “is an\nancient principle of our jurisprudence.” Mackenzie v. Hare , 239 U. S. 299, 311 (1915) .[ 9 ] See generally Brief for Professors of History\net al. as Amici Curiae 4–15. Through the early 20th\ncentury, a male citizen automatically conferred U. S.\ncitizenship on his alien wife. Act of Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, §2,\n10Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen , 7 Wall. 496, 498\n(1869) (the 1855 Act “confers the privileges of citizenship upon\nwomen married to citizens of the United States”); C. Bredbenner, A\nNationality of Her Own:Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship\n15–16, 20–21 (1998). A female citizen, however, was incapable of\nconferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was subject to\nexpatriation if she married an alien.[ 10 ] The family of a citizen or a lawfully admitted\npermanent resident enjoyed statutory exemptions from entry\nrequirements, but only if the citizen or resident was male. See, e.g. , Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §37, 32Stat. 1221\n(wives and children entering the country to join permanent-resident\naliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases during\ntransit shall not be deported if the diseases were easily curable\nor did not present a danger to others); S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st\nCong., 2d Sess., 415–417 (1950) (wives exempt from literacy and\nquota requirements). And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born\nchild of a married couple gained U. S. citizenship only\nthrough the father.[ 11 ] For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition\nnever held sway. Instead, the mother was regarded as the child’s\nnatural and sole guardian. At common law, the mother, and only the\nmother, was “bound to maintain [a nonmarital child] as its natural\nguardian.” 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *215–*216 (8th\ned. 1854); see Nguyen , 533 U. S., at 91–92 (O’Connor,\nJ., dissenting). In line with that understanding, in the early 20th\ncentury, the State Department sometimes permitted unwed mothers to\npass citizenship to their children, despite the absence of any\nstatutory authority for the practice. See Hearings on H. R.\n6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization,\n76th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings);\n39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 397–398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291\n(1939). See also Collins, Illegitimate Borders: Jus\nSanguinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family,\nRace, and Nation, 123 Yale L. J. 2134, 2199–2205 (2014)\n(hereinafter Collins). In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the\nfather-controls assumption concerning married parents, but codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried parents.\nThe Roosevelt administration, which proposed §1409, explained:\n“[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child] stands in the place of the\nfather . . . [,] has a right tothe custody and control of\nsuch a child as against the putative father, and is bound to\nmaintain it as its natu-ral guardian.” 1940 Hearings 431 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion\nrenders §1409’s gender-based residency rules understandable.\nFearing that a foreign-born child could turn out “more alien than\nAmerican in character,” the administration believed that a citizen\nparent with lengthy ties to the United States would counteract the\ninfluence of the alien parent. Id. , at 426–427. Concern\nabout the attachment of foreign-born children to the United States\nexplains the treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to\nthe familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have scant\ncontact with, their nonmarital children. For unwed citizen mothers,\nhowever, there was no need for a prolonged residency prophylactic:\nThe alien father, who might transmit foreign ways, was\npresumptively out of the picture. See id. , at 431; Collins\n2203 (in “nearly uniform view” of U. S. officials, “almost\ninvariably,” the mother alone “concern[ed] herself with [a\nnonmarital] child” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 2 For close to a half century, as earlier\nobserved, see supra , at 7–8, this Court has viewed with\nsuspicion laws that rely on “overbroad generalizations about the\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and\nfemales.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S., at 643, 648. In particular, we\nhave recognized that if a “statutory objective is to exclude or\n‘protect’ members of one gender” in reliance on “fixed notions\nconcerning [that gender’s] roles and abilities,” the “objective\nitself is illegitimate.” Mississippi Univ. for Women , 458\nU. S., at 725. In accord with this eventual understanding, the\nCourt has held that no “important [governmental] interest” is\nserved by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the\nobsolescing view that “unwed fathers [are] invariably less\nqualified and entitled than mothers” to take responsibility for\nnonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441\nU. S. 380, 382, 394 (1979) .[ 12 ] Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court\nhas come to comprehend, have a constraining impact, descriptive\nthough they may be of the way many people still order their\nlives.[ 13 ] Laws according or\ndenying benefits in reliance on “[s]tereotypes about women’s\ndomestic roles,” the Court has observed, may “creat[e] a\nself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that force[s] women to\ncontinue to assume the role of primary family caregiver.” Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721,\n736 (2003) . Correspondingly, such laws may disserve men who\nexercise responsibility for raising their children. See ibid. In light of the equal protection jurisprudence this\nCourt has developed since 1971, see Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531–534, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers\nwho have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly\nanachronistic. B In urging this Court nevertheless to reject\nMorales-Santana’s equal protection plea, the Government cites three\ndecisions of this Court: Fiallo v. Bell , 430\nU. S. 787 (1977) ; Miller v. Albright , 523\nU. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53\n. None controls this case. The 1952 Act provision at issue in Fiallo gave special immigration preferences to alien children of citizen\n(or lawful-permanent-resident) mothers, and to alien unwed mothers\nof citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children. 430 U. S.,\nat 788–789, and n. 1. Unwed fathers and their children,\nasserting their right to equal protection, sought the same\npreferences. Id. , at 791. Applying minimal scrutiny\n(rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on\nCongress’ “exceptionally broad power” to admit or exclude aliens. Id. , at 792, 794.[ 14 ]\nThis case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.\nMorales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a\nU. S. citizen. Examining a claim of that order, the Court has\nnot disclaimed, as it did in Fiallo , the application of an\nexacting standard of review. See Nguyen , 533 U. S., at\n60–61, 70; Miller , 523 U. S., at 434–435, n. ",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL v .\nMORALES-SANTANA certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit No. 15–1191. Argued November 9, 2016—Decided\nJune 12, 2017 The Immigration and Nationality Act provides\nthe framework for acquisition of U. S. citizenship from birth\nby a child born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen and\nthe other a citizen of another nation. Applicable to married\ncouples, the main rule in effect at the time here relevant, 8\nU. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), required the\nU. S.-citizen parent to have ten years’ physical presence in\nthe United States prior to the child’s birth, “at least five of\nwhich were after attaining” age 14. The rule is made applicable to\nunwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a), but §1409(c) creates\nan exception for an unwed U. S.-citizen mother, whose\ncitizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has\nlived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to\nthe child’s birth. Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana, who has\nlived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the U. S. citizenship of his\nbiological father, José Morales. José moved to the Dominican\nRepublic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave\nbirth to Morales-Santana. José accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household; he married\nMorales-Santana’s mother and his name was then added to hers on\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate. In 2000, the Government sought\nto remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions,\nranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did\nnot satisfy the requirement of five years’ physical presence after\nage 14. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s citizenship\nclaim and ordered his removal. Morales-Santana later moved to\nreopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government’s refusal to\nrecognize that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen\nfather violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. The\nBoard of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of\nthe equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based\nclassifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential\ntreatment of unwed mothers and fathers. To cure this infirmity, the\nCourt of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship\nthrough his father, just as he would were his mother the U. S.\ncitizen. Held : 1. The gender line Congress drew is\nincompatible with the Fifth Amendment’s requirement that the\nGovernment accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Pp. 6–23. (a) Morales-Santana satisfies the\nrequirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his\nfather’s right to equal protection. José Morales’ ability to pass\ncitizenship to his son easily satisfies the requirement that the\nthird party have a “ ‘close’ relationship with the person who\npossesses the right.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543\nU. S. 125 . And José’s death many years before the current\ncontroversy arose is “a ‘hindrance’ to [José’s] ability to protect\nhis own interests.” Ibid. Pp. 6–7. (b) Sections 1401 and 1409 date from an\nera when the Nation’s lawbooks were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. Today, such laws\nreceive the heightened scrutiny that now attends “all gender-based\nclassifications,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.\nT. B. , 511 U. S. 127 , including laws granting or denying\nbenefits “on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,” Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76 . Prescribing\none rule for mothers, another for fathers, §1409 is of the same\ngenre as the classifications declared unconstitutional in Westcott ; Reed v. Reed , 404 U. S. 71 –77; Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S. 636 –653;\nand Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207. A\nsuccessful defense therefore requires an “ ‘exceedingly\npersuasive justification.’ ” United States v. Virginia , 518 U. S. 515 . Pp. 7–9. (c) The Government must show, at least,\nthat its gender-based “ ‘classification serves “important\ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed”\nare “substantially related to [achieving] those\nobjectives.” ’ ” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533.\nThe classification must serve an important governmental interest today , for “new insights and societal understandings can\nreveal unjustified inequality . . . that once passed\nunnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges ,\n576 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 9–14. (1) At the time §1409 was enacted as part\nof the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), two once habitual, but\nnow untenable, assumptions pervaded the Nation’s citizenship laws\nand underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage,\nhusband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the sole\nguardian of a nonmarital child. In the 1940 Act, Congress codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.\nAccording to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified\nfor unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have\nscant contact with, their nonmarital children. Unwed citizen\nmothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father,\nalong with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.\nPp. 9–13. (2) For close to a half century, this\nCourt has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on “overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533. No “important [governmental] interest” is served by laws\ngrounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that\n“unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than\nmothers” to take responsibility for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441 U. S. 380 . In light of\nthis equal protection jurisprudence, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are\nanachronistic. Pp. 13–14. (d) The Government points to Fiallo v. Bell , 430 U. S. 787 ; Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53 , for support. But Fiallo involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not\npresent a claim of U. S. citizenship. And Miller and Nguyen addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well\nmet here, not the length of a parent’s prebirth residency in the\nUnited States. Pp. 14–16. (e) The Government’s suggested rationales\nfor §1409(a) and (c)’s gender-based differential do not survive\nheightened scrutiny. Pp. 16–23. (1) The Government asserts that Congress\nsought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection\nto the United States. The statute, the Government suggests,\nbracketed an unwed U. S.-citizen mother with a married couple\nin which both parents are U. S. citizens because she is the\nonly legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed\nU. S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a\ncitizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national\ninfluence of the alien mother. This rationale conforms to the\nlong-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.\nAnd the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested\ncongressional interest. Citizenship may be transmitted to children\nwho have no tie to the United States so long as their\nU. S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United\nStates for one year at any point in her life prior to the\nchild’s birth; but it may not be transmitted by a\nU. S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting\n§1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he\nacknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the\nchild in the United States. Pp. 17–19. (2) The Government also maintains that\nCongress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the\nforeign-born child of a U. S. citizen. But congressional\nhearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a\nstatelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence\nrequirements. Nor has the Government shown that the risk of\nstatelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Pp. 19–23. 2. Because this Court is not equipped to\nconvert §1409(c)’s exception for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers\ninto the main rule displacing §§1401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to\nCongress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor\ndisadvantages any person on the basis of gender. In the interim,\n§1401(a)(7)’s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to\nchildren born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. The\nlegislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs\nthe choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending\nfavorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable\ntreatment from the favored class. Ordinarily, the preferred rule is\nto extend favorable treatment. Westcott , 443 U. S., at\n89–90. Here, however, extension to fathers of §1409(c)’s favorable\ntreatment for mothers would displace Congress’ general rule, the\nlonger physical-presence requirements of §§1401(a)(7) and 1409\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers and\nU. S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the\nchild’s alien parent. Congress’ “ ‘commitment to th[is]\nresidual policy’ ” and “ ‘the degree of potential\ndisruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as\nopposed to abrogation,’ ” Heckler v. Mathews ,\n465 U. S. 728 , n. 5, indicate that Congress would likely\nhave abrogated §1409(c)’s special exception, preferring to preserve\n“the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of\ndedicated attachment,” Rogers v. Bellei , 401\nU. S. 815 . Pp. 23–28. 804 F. 3d 520, affirmed in part, reversed\nin part, and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed an opinion\nconcurring in the judgment in part, in which Alito, J., joined.\nGorsuch, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the\ncase.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1191 _________________ JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [June 12, 2017] Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case concerns a gender-based differential\nin the law governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a\nchild born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the\nother, a citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in\n8 U. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g)\n(2012 ed.). Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires a\nperiod of physical presence in the United States for the\nU. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially\nprescribed, was ten years’ physical presence prior to the child’s\nbirth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years\nprebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule is rendered\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a).\nCongress ordered an exception, however, for unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c), the exception\nallows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born\nabroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year\nprior to the child’s birth. The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón\nMorales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father\nwas just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)’s physical-presence\nrequirement. Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic,\nMorales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle\nimplicit in the Fifth Amendment[ 1 ] entitles him to citizenship stature. We hold that the\ngender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that\nthe Government accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Nevertheless, we cannot convert §1409(c)’s exception for\nunwed mothers into the main rule displacing §1401(a)(7) (covering\nmarried couples) and §1409(a) (covering unwed fathers). We must\ntherefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a\nphysical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other\nperiod) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one\nU. S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed. In the\ninterim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are\nadministered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination. I A We first describe in greater detail the regime\nCongress constructed. The general rules for acquiring U. S.\ncitizenship are found in 8 U. S. C. §1401, the first\nsection in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (1952 Act or INA), §301, 66Stat. 235–236. Section\n1401 sets forth the INA’s rules for determining who “shall be\nnationals and citizens of the United States at birth” by\nestablishing a range of residency and physical-presence\nrequirements calibrated primarily to the parents’ nationality and\nthe child’s place of birth. §1401(a) (1958 ed.); §1401 (2012 ed.).\nThe primacy of §1401 in the statutory scheme is evident.\nComprehensive in coverage, §1401 provides the general framework for\nthe acquisition of citizenship at birth. In particular, at the time\nrelevant here,[ 2 ] §1401(a)(7)\nprovided for the U. S. citizenship of “a person born outside the geographical\nlimits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents\none of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United\nStates who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically\npresent in the United States or its outlying possessions for a\nperiod or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five\nof which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided , That any periods of honorable service in the Armed\nForces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included\nin computing the physical presence requirements of this\nparagraph.” Congress has since reduced the duration\nrequirement to five years, two after age 14. §1401(g) (2012\ned.).[ 3 ] Section 1409 pertains specifically to children\nwith unmarried parents. Its first subsection, §1409(a),\nincorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of\n§1401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to\ntransmit U. S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the\nsame terms as a married citizen parent. Section 1409(c)—a provision\napplicable only to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers—states an\nexception to the physical-presence requirements of §§1401 and\n1409(a). Under §1409(c)’s exception, only one year of continuous\nphysical presence is required before unwed mothers may pass\ncitizenship to their children born abroad. B Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana moved to\nthe United States at age 13, and has resided in this country most\nof his life. Now facing deportation, he asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biological\nfather, José Morales, who accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household. José Morales was born in Guánica, Puerto Rico,\non March 19, 1900. Record 55–56. Puerto Rico was then, as it is\nnow, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle , 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 2–4); 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (“The term\nUnited States . . . means the continental United States,\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U. S.] Virgin\nIslands.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); §1101(a)(38) (2012\ned.) (similar), and José became a U. S. citizen under the\nOrganic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, §5, 39Stat. 953 (a predecessor\nto 8 U. S. C. §1402). After living in Puerto Rico for\nnearly two decades, José left his childhood home on February 27,\n1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. Record 57, 66. He did so to take up employment as a\nbuilder-mechanic for a U. S. company in the\nthen-U. S.-occupied Dominican Republic. Ibid. [ 4 ] By 1959, José attested in a June 21, 1971\naffidavit presented to the U. S. Embassy in the Dominican\nRepublic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Dominican\nwoman he would eventually marry. Id. , at 57. In 1962, Yrma\ngave birth to their child, respondent Luis Morales-Santana. Id. , at 166–167. While the record before us reveals little\nabout Morales-Santana’s childhood, the Dominican archives disclose\nthat Yrma and José married in 1970, and that José was then added to\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate as his father. Id. , at\n163–164, 167. José also related in the same affidavit that he was\nthen saving money “for the susten[ance] of [his] family” in\nanticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where members of\nhis family still resided. Id. , at 57. In 1975, when\nMorales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico, id. , at\n368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was attending public\nschool in the Bronx, a New York City borough, id. , at 140,\n369.[ 5 ] C In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana\nin removal proceedings based on several convictions for offenses\nunder New York State Penal Law, all of them rendered on May 17,\n1995. Id. , at 426. Morales-Santana ranked as an alien\ndespite the many years he lived in the United States, because, at\nthe time of his birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement\nof five years’ physical presence after age 14. See supra , at\n3–4, and n. 3. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s\nclaim to citizenship derived from the U. S. citizenship of his\nfather, and ordered Morales-Santana’s removal to the Dominican\nRepublic. Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a–49a. In 2010,\nMorales-Santana moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the\nGovernment’s refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from\nhis U. S.-citizen father violated the Constitution’s equal\nprotection guarantee. See Record 27, 45. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) denied the motion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a,\n42a–44a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the BIA’s decision. 804 F. 3d 520, 524\n(2015). Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of the equal\nprotection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications,\nthe court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed\nmothers and fathers. Id. , at 527–535. To cure the\nconstitutional flaw, the court further held that Morales-Santana\nderived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his\nmother the U. S. citizen. Id. , at 535–538. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit declined to follow the conflicting\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Flores-Villar , 536 F. 3d 990 (2008), see 804\nF. 3d, at 530, 535, n. 17. We granted certiorariin Flores-Villar , but ultimately affirmed by an equally divided\nCourt. Flores-Villar v. United States , 564 U. S.\n210 (2011) ( per curiam ). Taking up Morales-Santana’s\nrequest for review, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), we consider the\nmatter anew. II Because §1409 treats sons and daughters alike,\nMorales-Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based\ndiscrimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of\nMorales-Santana’s birth and was not accorded the right an unwed\nU. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her\nchild. Although the Government does not contend otherwise, we\nbriefly explain why Morales-Santana may seek to vindicate his\nfather’s right to the equal protection of the laws.[ 6 ] Ordinarily, a party “must assert his own legal\nrights” and “cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights\n. . . of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin ,\n422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975) . But we recognize an exception\nwhere, as here, “the party asserting the right has a close\nrelationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is\na hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his own\ninterests.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125,\n130 (2004) (quoting Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S.\n400, 411 (1991) ). José Morales’ ability to pass citizenship to his\nson, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies the “close\nrelationship” requirement. So, too, is the “hindrance” requirement\nwell met. José Morales’ failure to assert a claim in his own right\n“stems from disability,” not “disinterest,” Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420, 450 (1998) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), for José died in 1976, Record 140, many\nyears before the current controversy arose. See Hodel v. Irving , 481 U. S. 704 –712, 723, n. 7 (1987)\n(children and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights of\ndeceased relatives). Morales-Santana is thus the “obvious\nclaimant,” see Craig v. Boren , 429 U. S. 190,\n197 (1976) , the “best available proponent,” Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U. S. 106, 116 (1976) , of his father’s\nright to equal protection. III Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an\nera when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. See, e.g. , Hoyt v. Florida , 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961) (women\nare the “center of home and family life,” therefore they can be\n“relieved from the civic duty of jury service”); Goesaert v. Cleary , 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (States may draw “a\nsharp line between the sexes”). Today, laws of this kind are\nsubject to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends\n“all gender-based classifications.” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127, 136 (1994) ; see, e.g. , United States v. Virginia , 518\nU. S. 515 –556 (1996) (state-maintained military academy may\nnot deny admission to qualified women). Laws granting or denying benefits “on the basis\nof the sex of the qualifying parent,” our post-1970 decisions\naffirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore attract\nheightened review under the Constitution’s equal protection\nguarantee. Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76,\n84 (1979) ; see id. , at 88–89 (holding unconstitutional\nprovision of unemployed-parent benefits exclusively to fathers).\nAccord Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207\n(1977) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that denied widowers survivors’ benefits\navailable to widows); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420\nU. S. 636 –653 (1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that excluded fathers from receipt of\nchild-in-care benefits available to mothers); Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691 (1973) (plurality\nopinion) (holding unconstitutional exclusion of married female\nofficers in the military from benefits automatically accorded\nmarried male officers); cf. Reed v. Reed , 404\nU. S. 71 –77 (1971) (holding unconstitutional a probate-code\npreference for a father over a mother as administrator of a\ndeceased child’s estate).[ 7 ] Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for\nfathers, §1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we\ndeclared unconstitutional in Reed , Frontiero , Wiesenfeld , Goldfarb , and Westcott . As in\nthose cases, heightened scrutiny is in order. Successful defense of\nlegislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have\nreiterated, requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Kirchberg v. Feenstra , 450 U. S. 455,\n461 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). A The defender of legislation that\ndifferentiates on the basis of gender must show “at least that the\n[challenged] classification serves important governmental\nobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533 (quoting Mississippi\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan , 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982)\n; alteration in original); see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53, 60, 70 (2001) . Moreover, the\nclassification must substantially serve an important governmental\ninterest today , for “in interpreting the [e]qual\n[p]rotection [guarantee], [we have] recognized that new insights\nand societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality\n. . . that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 20). Here, the Government has supplied no\n“exceedingly persuasive justification,” Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted), for §1409(a)\nand (c)’s “gender-based” and “gender-biased” disparity, Westcott , 443 U. S., at 84 (internalquotation marks\nomitted). 1 History reveals what lurks behind §1409.\nEnacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54Stat.\n1139–1140, §1409 ended a century and a half of congressional\nsilence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed\nparents.[ 8 ] During this era,\ntwo once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our\nNation’s citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and\nadministrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife\nsubordinate; unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a\nnonmarital child. Under the once entrenched principle of male\ndominance in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.\n“[D]ominance [of] the husband,” this Court observed in 1915, “is an\nancient principle of our jurisprudence.” Mackenzie v. Hare , 239 U. S. 299, 311 (1915) .[ 9 ] See generally Brief for Professors of History\net al. as Amici Curiae 4–15. Through the early 20th\ncentury, a male citizen automatically conferred U. S.\ncitizenship on his alien wife. Act of Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, §2,\n10Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen , 7 Wall. 496, 498\n(1869) (the 1855 Act “confers the privileges of citizenship upon\nwomen married to citizens of the United States”); C. Bredbenner, A\nNationality of Her Own:Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship\n15–16, 20–21 (1998). A female citizen, however, was incapable of\nconferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was subject to\nexpatriation if she married an alien.[ 10 ] The family of a citizen or a lawfully admitted\npermanent resident enjoyed statutory exemptions from entry\nrequirements, but only if the citizen or resident was male. See, e.g. , Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §37, 32Stat. 1221\n(wives and children entering the country to join permanent-resident\naliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases during\ntransit shall not be deported if the diseases were easily curable\nor did not present a danger to others); S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st\nCong., 2d Sess., 415–417 (1950) (wives exempt from literacy and\nquota requirements). And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born\nchild of a married couple gained U. S. citizenship only\nthrough the father.[ 11 ] For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition\nnever held sway. Instead, the mother was regarded as the child’s\nnatural and sole guardian. At common law, the mother, and only the\nmother, was “bound to maintain [a nonmarital child] as its natural\nguardian.” 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *215–*216 (8th\ned. 1854); see Nguyen , 533 U. S., at 91–92 (O’Connor,\nJ., dissenting). In line with that understanding, in the early 20th\ncentury, the State Department sometimes permitted unwed mothers to\npass citizenship to their children, despite the absence of any\nstatutory authority for the practice. See Hearings on H. R.\n6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization,\n76th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings);\n39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 397–398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291\n(1939). See also Collins, Illegitimate Borders: Jus\nSanguinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family,\nRace, and Nation, 123 Yale L. J. 2134, 2199–2205 (2014)\n(hereinafter Collins). In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the\nfather-controls assumption concerning married parents, but codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried parents.\nThe Roosevelt administration, which proposed §1409, explained:\n“[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child] stands in the place of the\nfather . . . [,] has a right tothe custody and control of\nsuch a child as against the putative father, and is bound to\nmaintain it as its natu-ral guardian.” 1940 Hearings 431 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion\nrenders §1409’s gender-based residency rules understandable.\nFearing that a foreign-born child could turn out “more alien than\nAmerican in character,” the administration believed that a citizen\nparent with lengthy ties to the United States would counteract the\ninfluence of the alien parent. Id. , at 426–427. Concern\nabout the attachment of foreign-born children to the United States\nexplains the treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to\nthe familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have scant\ncontact with, their nonmarital children. For unwed citizen mothers,\nhowever, there was no need for a prolonged residency prophylactic:\nThe alien father, who might transmit foreign ways, was\npresumptively out of the picture. See id. , at 431; Collins\n2203 (in “nearly uniform view” of U. S. officials, “almost\ninvariably,” the mother alone “concern[ed] herself with [a\nnonmarital] child” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 2 For close to a half century, as earlier\nobserved, see supra , at 7–8, this Court has viewed with\nsuspicion laws that rely on “overbroad generalizations about the\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and\nfemales.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S., at 643, 648. In particular, we\nhave recognized that if a “statutory objective is to exclude or\n‘protect’ members of one gender” in reliance on “fixed notions\nconcerning [that gender’s] roles and abilities,” the “objective\nitself is illegitimate.” Mississippi Univ. for Women , 458\nU. S., at 725. In accord with this eventual understanding, the\nCourt has held that no “important [governmental] interest” is\nserved by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the\nobsolescing view that “unwed fathers [are] invariably less\nqualified and entitled than mothers” to take responsibility for\nnonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441\nU. S. 380, 382, 394 (1979) .[ 12 ] Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court\nhas come to comprehend, have a constraining impact, descriptive\nthough they may be of the way many people still order their\nlives.[ 13 ] Laws according or\ndenying benefits in reliance on “[s]tereotypes about women’s\ndomestic roles,” the Court has observed, may “creat[e] a\nself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that force[s] women to\ncontinue to assume the role of primary family caregiver.” Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721,\n736 (2003) . Correspondingly, such laws may disserve men who\nexercise responsibility for raising their children. See ibid. In light of the equal protection jurisprudence this\nCourt has developed since 1971, see Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531–534, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers\nwho have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly\nanachronistic. B In urging this Court nevertheless to reject\nMorales-Santana’s equal protection plea, the Government cites three\ndecisions of this Court: Fiallo v. Bell , 430\nU. S. 787 (1977) ; Miller v. Albright , 523\nU. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53\n. None controls this case. The 1952 Act provision at issue in Fiallo gave special immigration preferences to alien children of citizen\n(or lawful-permanent-resident) mothers, and to alien unwed mothers\nof citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children. 430 U. S.,\nat 788–789, and n. 1. Unwed fathers and their children,\nasserting their right to equal protection, sought the same\npreferences. Id. , at 791. Applying minimal scrutiny\n(rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on\nCongress’ “exceptionally broad power” to admit or exclude aliens. Id. , at 792, 794.[ 14 ]\nThis case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.\nMorales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a\nU. S. citizen. Examining a claim of that order, the Court has\nnot disclaimed, as it did in Fiallo , the application of an\nexacting standard of review. See Nguyen , 533 U. S., at\n60–61, 70; Miller , 523 U. S., at 434–435, n. ",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL v .\nMORALES-SANTANA certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit No. 15–1191. Argued November 9, 2016—Decided\nJune 12, 2017 The Immigration and Nationality Act provides\nthe framework for acquisition of U. S. citizenship from birth\nby a child born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen and\nthe other a citizen of another nation. Applicable to married\ncouples, the main rule in effect at the time here relevant, 8\nU. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), required the\nU. S.-citizen parent to have ten years’ physical presence in\nthe United States prior to the child’s birth, “at least five of\nwhich were after attaining” age 14. The rule is made applicable to\nunwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a), but §1409(c) creates\nan exception for an unwed U. S.-citizen mother, whose\ncitizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has\nlived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to\nthe child’s birth. Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana, who has\nlived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the U. S. citizenship of his\nbiological father, José Morales. José moved to the Dominican\nRepublic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave\nbirth to Morales-Santana. José accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household; he married\nMorales-Santana’s mother and his name was then added to hers on\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate. In 2000, the Government sought\nto remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions,\nranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did\nnot satisfy the requirement of five years’ physical presence after\nage 14. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s citizenship\nclaim and ordered his removal. Morales-Santana later moved to\nreopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government’s refusal to\nrecognize that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen\nfather violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. The\nBoard of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of\nthe equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based\nclassifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential\ntreatment of unwed mothers and fathers. To cure this infirmity, the\nCourt of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship\nthrough his father, just as he would were his mother the U. S.\ncitizen. Held : 1. The gender line Congress drew is\nincompatible with the Fifth Amendment’s requirement that the\nGovernment accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Pp. 6–23. (a) Morales-Santana satisfies the\nrequirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his\nfather’s right to equal protection. José Morales’ ability to pass\ncitizenship to his son easily satisfies the requirement that the\nthird party have a “ ‘close’ relationship with the person who\npossesses the right.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543\nU. S. 125 . And José’s death many years before the current\ncontroversy arose is “a ‘hindrance’ to [José’s] ability to protect\nhis own interests.” Ibid. Pp. 6–7. (b) Sections 1401 and 1409 date from an\nera when the Nation’s lawbooks were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. Today, such laws\nreceive the heightened scrutiny that now attends “all gender-based\nclassifications,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.\nT. B. , 511 U. S. 127 , including laws granting or denying\nbenefits “on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,” Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76 . Prescribing\none rule for mothers, another for fathers, §1409 is of the same\ngenre as the classifications declared unconstitutional in Westcott ; Reed v. Reed , 404 U. S. 71 –77; Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S. 636 –653;\nand Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207. A\nsuccessful defense therefore requires an “ ‘exceedingly\npersuasive justification.’ ” United States v. Virginia , 518 U. S. 515 . Pp. 7–9. (c) The Government must show, at least,\nthat its gender-based “ ‘classification serves “important\ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed”\nare “substantially related to [achieving] those\nobjectives.” ’ ” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533.\nThe classification must serve an important governmental interest today , for “new insights and societal understandings can\nreveal unjustified inequality . . . that once passed\nunnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges ,\n576 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 9–14. (1) At the time §1409 was enacted as part\nof the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), two once habitual, but\nnow untenable, assumptions pervaded the Nation’s citizenship laws\nand underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage,\nhusband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the sole\nguardian of a nonmarital child. In the 1940 Act, Congress codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.\nAccording to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified\nfor unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have\nscant contact with, their nonmarital children. Unwed citizen\nmothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father,\nalong with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.\nPp. 9–13. (2) For close to a half century, this\nCourt has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on “overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533. No “important [governmental] interest” is served by laws\ngrounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that\n“unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than\nmothers” to take responsibility for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441 U. S. 380 . In light of\nthis equal protection jurisprudence, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are\nanachronistic. Pp. 13–14. (d) The Government points to Fiallo v. Bell , 430 U. S. 787 ; Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53 , for support. But Fiallo involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not\npresent a claim of U. S. citizenship. And Miller and Nguyen addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well\nmet here, not the length of a parent’s prebirth residency in the\nUnited States. Pp. 14–16. (e) The Government’s suggested rationales\nfor §1409(a) and (c)’s gender-based differential do not survive\nheightened scrutiny. Pp. 16–23. (1) The Government asserts that Congress\nsought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection\nto the United States. The statute, the Government suggests,\nbracketed an unwed U. S.-citizen mother with a married couple\nin which both parents are U. S. citizens because she is the\nonly legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed\nU. S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a\ncitizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national\ninfluence of the alien mother. This rationale conforms to the\nlong-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.\nAnd the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested\ncongressional interest. Citizenship may be transmitted to children\nwho have no tie to the United States so long as their\nU. S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United\nStates for one year at any point in her life prior to the\nchild’s birth; but it may not be transmitted by a\nU. S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting\n§1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he\nacknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the\nchild in the United States. Pp. 17–19. (2) The Government also maintains that\nCongress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the\nforeign-born child of a U. S. citizen. But congressional\nhearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a\nstatelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence\nrequirements. Nor has the Government shown that the risk of\nstatelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Pp. 19–23. 2. Because this Court is not equipped to\nconvert §1409(c)’s exception for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers\ninto the main rule displacing §§1401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to\nCongress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor\ndisadvantages any person on the basis of gender. In the interim,\n§1401(a)(7)’s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to\nchildren born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. The\nlegislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs\nthe choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending\nfavorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable\ntreatment from the favored class. Ordinarily, the preferred rule is\nto extend favorable treatment. Westcott , 443 U. S., at\n89–90. Here, however, extension to fathers of §1409(c)’s favorable\ntreatment for mothers would displace Congress’ general rule, the\nlonger physical-presence requirements of §§1401(a)(7) and 1409\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers and\nU. S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the\nchild’s alien parent. Congress’ “ ‘commitment to th[is]\nresidual policy’ ” and “ ‘the degree of potential\ndisruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as\nopposed to abrogation,’ ” Heckler v. Mathews ,\n465 U. S. 728 , n. 5, indicate that Congress would likely\nhave abrogated §1409(c)’s special exception, preferring to preserve\n“the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of\ndedicated attachment,” Rogers v. Bellei , 401\nU. S. 815 . Pp. 23–28. 804 F. 3d 520, affirmed in part, reversed\nin part, and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1191 _________________ JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [June 12, 2017] Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case concerns a gender-based differential\nin the law governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a\nchild born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the\nother, a citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in\n8 U. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g)\n(2012 ed.). Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires a\nperiod of physical presence in the United States for the\nU. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially\nprescribed, was ten years’ physical presence prior to the child’s\nbirth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years\nprebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule is rendered\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a).\nCongress ordered an exception, however, for unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c), the exception\nallows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born\nabroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year\nprior to the child’s birth. The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón\nMorales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father\nwas just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)’s physical-presence\nrequirement. Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic,\nMorales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle\nimplicit in the Fifth Amendment[ 1 ] entitles him to citizenship stature. We hold that the\ngender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that\nthe Government accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Nevertheless, we cannot convert §1409(c)’s exception for\nunwed mothers into the main rule displacing §1401(a)(7) (covering\nmarried couples) and §1409(a) (covering unwed fathers). We must\ntherefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a\nphysical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other\nperiod) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one\nU. S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed. In the\ninterim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are\nadministered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination. I A We first describe in greater detail the regime\nCongress constructed. The general rules for acquiring U. S.\ncitizenship are found in 8 U. S. C. §1401, the first\nsection in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (1952 Act or INA), §301, 66Stat. 235–236. Section\n1401 sets forth the INA’s rules for determining who “shall be\nnationals and citizens of the United States at birth” by\nestablishing a range of residency and physical-presence\nrequirements calibrated primarily to the parents’ nationality and\nthe child’s place of birth. §1401(a) (1958 ed.); §1401 (2012 ed.).\nThe primacy of §1401 in the statutory scheme is evident.\nComprehensive in coverage, §1401 provides the general framework for\nthe acquisition of citizenship at birth. In particular, at the time\nrelevant here,[ 2 ] §1401(a)(7)\nprovided for the U. S. citizenship of “a person born outside the geographical\nlimits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents\none of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United\nStates who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically\npresent in the United States or its outlying possessions for a\nperiod or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five\nof which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided , That any periods of honorable service in the Armed\nForces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included\nin computing the physical presence requirements of this\nparagraph.” Congress has since reduced the duration\nrequirement to five years, two after age 14. §1401(g) (2012\ned.).[ 3 ] Section 1409 pertains specifically to children\nwith unmarried parents. Its first subsection, §1409(a),\nincorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of\n§1401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to\ntransmit U. S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the\nsame terms as a married citizen parent. Section 1409(c)—a provision\napplicable only to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers—states an\nexception to the physical-presence requirements of §§1401 and\n1409(a). Under §1409(c)’s exception, only one year of continuous\nphysical presence is required before unwed mothers may pass\ncitizenship to their children born abroad. B Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana moved to\nthe United States at age 13, and has resided in this country most\nof his life. Now facing deportation, he asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biological\nfather, José Morales, who accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household. José Morales was born in Guánica, Puerto Rico,\non March 19, 1900. Record 55–56. Puerto Rico was then, as it is\nnow, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle , 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 2–4); 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (“The term\nUnited States . . . means the continental United States,\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U. S.] Virgin\nIslands.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); §1101(a)(38) (2012\ned.) (similar), and José became a U. S. citizen under the\nOrganic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, §5, 39Stat. 953 (a predecessor\nto 8 U. S. C. §1402). After living in Puerto Rico for\nnearly two decades, José left his childhood home on February 27,\n1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. Record 57, 66. He did so to take up employment as a\nbuilder-mechanic for a U. S. company in the\nthen-U. S.-occupied Dominican Republic. Ibid. [ 4 ] By 1959, José attested in a June 21, 1971\naffidavit presented to the U. S. Embassy in the Dominican\nRepublic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Dominican\nwoman he would eventually marry. Id. , at 57. In 1962, Yrma\ngave birth to their child, respondent Luis Morales-Santana. Id. , at 166–167. While the record before us reveals little\nabout Morales-Santana’s childhood, the Dominican archives disclose\nthat Yrma and José married in 1970, and that José was then added to\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate as his father. Id. , at\n163–164, 167. José also related in the same affidavit that he was\nthen saving money “for the susten[ance] of [his] family” in\nanticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where members of\nhis family still resided. Id. , at 57. In 1975, when\nMorales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico, id. , at\n368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was attending public\nschool in the Bronx, a New York City borough, id. , at 140,\n369.[ 5 ] C In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana\nin removal proceedings based on several convictions for offenses\nunder New York State Penal Law, all of them rendered on May 17,\n1995. Id. , at 426. Morales-Santana ranked as an alien\ndespite the many years he lived in the United States, because, at\nthe time of his birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement\nof five years’ physical presence after age 14. See supra , at\n3–4, and n. 3. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s\nclaim to citizenship derived from the U. S. citizenship of his\nfather, and ordered Morales-Santana’s removal to the Dominican\nRepublic. Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a–49a. In 2010,\nMorales-Santana moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the\nGovernment’s refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from\nhis U. S.-citizen father violated the Constitution’s equal\nprotection guarantee. See Record 27, 45. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) denied the motion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a,\n42a–44a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the BIA’s decision. 804 F. 3d 520, 524\n(2015). Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of the equal\nprotection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications,\nthe court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed\nmothers and fathers. Id. , at 527–535. To cure the\nconstitutional flaw, the court further held that Morales-Santana\nderived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his\nmother the U. S. citizen. Id. , at 535–538. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit declined to follow the conflicting\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Flores-Villar , 536 F. 3d 990 (2008), see 804\nF. 3d, at 530, 535, n. 17. We granted certiorariin Flores-Villar , but ultimately affirmed by an equally divided\nCourt. Flores-Villar v. United States , 564 U. S.\n210 (2011) ( per curiam ). Taking up Morales-Santana’s\nrequest for review, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), we consider the\nmatter anew. II Because §1409 treats sons and daughters alike,\nMorales-Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based\ndiscrimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of\nMorales-Santana’s birth and was not accorded the right an unwed\nU. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her\nchild. Although the Government does not contend otherwise, we\nbriefly explain why Morales-Santana may seek to vindicate his\nfather’s right to the equal protection of the laws.[ 6 ] Ordinarily, a party “must assert his own legal\nrights” and “cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights\n. . . of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin ,\n422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975) . But we recognize an exception\nwhere, as here, “the party asserting the right has a close\nrelationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is\na hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his own\ninterests.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125,\n130 (2004) (quoting Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S.\n400, 411 (1991) ). José Morales’ ability to pass citizenship to his\nson, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies the “close\nrelationship” requirement. So, too, is the “hindrance” requirement\nwell met. José Morales’ failure to assert a claim in his own right\n“stems from disability,” not “disinterest,” Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420, 450 (1998) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), for José died in 1976, Record 140, many\nyears before the current controversy arose. See Hodel v. Irving , 481 U. S. 704 –712, 723, n. 7 (1987)\n(children and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights of\ndeceased relatives). Morales-Santana is thus the “obvious\nclaimant,” see Craig v. Boren , 429 U. S. 190,\n197 (1976) , the “best available proponent,” Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U. S. 106, 116 (1976) , of his father’s\nright to equal protection. III Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an\nera when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. See, e.g. , Hoyt v. Florida , 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961) (women\nare the “center of home and family life,” therefore they can be\n“relieved from the civic duty of jury service”); Goesaert v. Cleary , 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (States may draw “a\nsharp line between the sexes”). Today, laws of this kind are\nsubject to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends\n“all gender-based classifications.” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127, 136 (1994) ; see, e.g. , United States v. Virginia , 518\nU. S. 515 –556 (1996) (state-maintained military academy may\nnot deny admission to qualified women). Laws granting or denying benefits “on the basis\nof the sex of the qualifying parent,” our post-1970 decisions\naffirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore attract\nheightened review under the Constitution’s equal protection\nguarantee. Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76,\n84 (1979) ; see id. , at 88–89 (holding unconstitutional\nprovision of unemployed-parent benefits exclusively to fathers).\nAccord Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207\n(1977) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that denied widowers survivors’ benefits\navailable to widows); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420\nU. S. 636 –653 (1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that excluded fathers from receipt of\nchild-in-care benefits available to mothers); Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691 (1973) (plurality\nopinion) (holding unconstitutional exclusion of married female\nofficers in the military from benefits automatically accorded\nmarried male officers); cf. Reed v. Reed , 404\nU. S. 71 –77 (1971) (holding unconstitutional a probate-code\npreference for a father over a mother as administrator of a\ndeceased child’s estate).[ 7 ] Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for\nfathers, §1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we\ndeclared unconstitutional in Reed , Frontiero , Wiesenfeld , Goldfarb , and Westcott . As in\nthose cases, heightened scrutiny is in order. Successful defense of\nlegislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have\nreiterated, requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Kirchberg v. Feenstra , 450 U. S. 455,\n461 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). A The defender of legislation that\ndifferentiates on the basis of gender must show “at least that the\n[challenged] classification serves important governmental\nobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533 (quoting Mississippi\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan , 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982)\n; alteration in original); see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53, 60, 70 (2001) . Moreover, the\nclassification must substantially serve an important governmental\ninterest today , for “in interpreting the [e]qual\n[p]rotection [guarantee], [we have] recognized that new insights\nand societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality\n. . . that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 20). Here, the Government has supplied no\n“exceedingly persuasive justification,” Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted), for §1409(a)\nand (c)’s “gender-based” and “gender-biased” disparity, Westcott , 443 U. S., at 84 (internalquotation marks\nomitted). 1 History reveals what lurks behind §1409.\nEnacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54Stat.\n1139–1140, §1409 ended a century and a half of congressional\nsilence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed\nparents.[ 8 ] During this era,\ntwo once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our\nNation’s citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and\nadministrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife\nsubordinate; unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a\nnonmarital child. Under the once entrenched principle of male\ndominance in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.\n“[D]ominance [of] the husband,” this Court observed in 1915, “is an\nancient principle of our jurisprudence.” Mackenzie v. Hare , 239 U. S. 299, 311 (1915) .[ 9 ] See generally Brief for Professors of History\net al. as Amici Curiae 4–15. Through the early 20th\ncentury, a male citizen automatically conferred U. S.\ncitizenship on his alien wife. Act of Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, §2,\n10Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen , 7 Wall. 496, 498\n(1869) (the 1855 Act “confers the privileges of citizenship upon\nwomen married to citizens of the United States”); C. Bredbenner, A\nNationality of Her Own:Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship\n15–16, 20–21 (1998). A female citizen, however, was incapable of\nconferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was subject to\nexpatriation if she married an alien.[ 10 ] The family of a citizen or a lawfully admitted\npermanent resident enjoyed statutory exemptions from entry\nrequirements, but only if the citizen or resident was male. See, e.g. , Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §37, 32Stat. 1221\n(wives and children entering the country to join permanent-resident\naliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases during\ntransit shall not be deported if the diseases were easily curable\nor did not present a danger to others); S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st\nCong., 2d Sess., 415–417 (1950) (wives exempt from literacy and\nquota requirements). And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born\nchild of a married couple gained U. S. citizenship only\nthrough the father.[ 11 ] For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition\nnever held sway. Instead, the mother was regarded as the child’s\nnatural and sole guardian. At common law, the mother, and only the\nmother, was “bound to maintain [a nonmarital child] as its natural\nguardian.” 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *215–*216 (8th\ned. 1854); see Nguyen , 533 U. S., at 91–92 (O’Connor,\nJ., dissenting). In line with that understanding, in the early 20th\ncentury, the State Department sometimes permitted unwed mothers to\npass citizenship to their children, despite the absence of any\nstatutory authority for the practice. See Hearings on H. R.\n6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization,\n76th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings);\n39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 397–398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291\n(1939). See also Collins, Illegitimate Borders: Jus\nSanguinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family,\nRace, and Nation, 123 Yale L. J. 2134, 2199–2205 (2014)\n(hereinafter Collins). In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the\nfather-controls assumption concerning married parents, but codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried parents.\nThe Roosevelt administration, which proposed §1409, explained:\n“[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child] stands in the place of the\nfather . . . [,] has a right tothe custody and control of\nsuch a child as against the putative father, and is bound to\nmaintain it as its natu-ral guardian.” 1940 Hearings 431 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion\nrenders §1409’s gender-based residency rules understandable.\nFearing that a foreign-born child could turn out “more alien than\nAmerican in character,” the administration believed that a citizen\nparent with lengthy ties to the United States would counteract the\ninfluence of the alien parent. Id. , at 426–427. Concern\nabout the attachment of foreign-born children to the United States\nexplains the treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to\nthe familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have scant\ncontact with, their nonmarital children. For unwed citizen mothers,\nhowever, there was no need for a prolonged residency prophylactic:\nThe alien father, who might transmit foreign ways, was\npresumptively out of the picture. See id. , at 431; Collins\n2203 (in “nearly uniform view” of U. S. officials, “almost\ninvariably,” the mother alone “concern[ed] herself with [a\nnonmarital] child” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 2 For close to a half century, as earlier\nobserved, see supra , at 7–8, this Court has viewed with\nsuspicion laws that rely on “overbroad generalizations about the\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and\nfemales.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S., at 643, 648. In particular, we\nhave recognized that if a “statutory objective is to exclude or\n‘protect’ members of one gender” in reliance on “fixed notions\nconcerning [that gender’s] roles and abilities,” the “objective\nitself is illegitimate.” Mississippi Univ. for Women , 458\nU. S., at 725. In accord with this eventual understanding, the\nCourt has held that no “important [governmental] interest” is\nserved by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the\nobsolescing view that “unwed fathers [are] invariably less\nqualified and entitled than mothers” to take responsibility for\nnonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441\nU. S. 380, 382, 394 (1979) .[ 12 ] Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court\nhas come to comprehend, have a constraining impact, descriptive\nthough they may be of the way many people still order their\nlives.[ 13 ] Laws according or\ndenying benefits in reliance on “[s]tereotypes about women’s\ndomestic roles,” the Court has observed, may “creat[e] a\nself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that force[s] women to\ncontinue to assume the role of primary family caregiver.” Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721,\n736 (2003) . Correspondingly, such laws may disserve men who\nexercise responsibility for raising their children. See ibid. In light of the equal protection jurisprudence this\nCourt has developed since 1971, see Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531–534, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers\nwho have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly\nanachronistic. B In urging this Court nevertheless to reject\nMorales-Santana’s equal protection plea, the Government cites three\ndecisions of this Court: Fiallo v. Bell , 430\nU. S. 787 (1977) ; Miller v. Albright , 523\nU. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53\n. None controls this case. The 1952 Act provision at issue in Fiallo gave special immigration preferences to alien children of citizen\n(or lawful-permanent-resident) mothers, and to alien unwed mothers\nof citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children. 430 U. S.,\nat 788–789, and n. 1. Unwed fathers and their children,\nasserting their right to equal protection, sought the same\npreferences. Id. , at 791. Applying minimal scrutiny\n(rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on\nCongress’ “exceptionally broad power” to admit or exclude aliens. Id. , at 792, 794.[ 14 ]\nThis case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.\nMorales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a\nU. S. citizen. Examining a claim of that order, the Court has\nnot disclaimed, as it did in Fiallo , the application of an\nexacting standard of review. See Nguyen , 533 U. S., at\n60–61, 70; Miller , 523 U. S., at 434–435, n. ",

Applicable to married\ncouples, the main rule in effect at the time here relevant, 8\nU. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), required the\nU. S.-citizen parent to have ten years’ physical presence in\nthe United States prior to the child’s birth, “at least five of\nwhich were after attaining” age 14. The rule is made applicable to\nunwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a), but §1409(c) creates\nan exception for an unwed U. S.-citizen mother, whose\ncitizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has\nlived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to\nthe child’s birth. Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana, who has\nlived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the U. S. citizenship of his\nbiological father, José Morales. José moved to the Dominican\nRepublic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave\nbirth to Morales-Santana. José accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household; he married\nMorales-Santana’s mother and his name was then added to hers on\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate. In 2000, the Government sought\nto remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions,\nranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did\nnot satisfy the requirement of five years’ physical presence after\nage 14. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s citizenship\nclaim and ordered his removal. Morales-Santana later moved to\nreopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government’s refusal to\nrecognize that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen\nfather violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. The\nBoard of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of\nthe equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based\nclassifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential\ntreatment of unwed mothers and fathers. To cure this infirmity, the\nCourt of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship\nthrough his father, just as he would were his mother the U. S.\ncitizen. Held : 1. The gender line Congress drew is\nincompatible with the Fifth Amendment’s requirement that the\nGovernment accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Pp. 6–23. (a) Morales-Santana satisfies the\nrequirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his\nfather’s right to equal protection. José Morales’ ability to pass\ncitizenship to his son easily satisfies the requirement that the\nthird party have a “ ‘close’ relationship with the person who\npossesses the right.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543\nU. S. 125 . And José’s death many years before the current\ncontroversy arose is “a ‘hindrance’ to [José’s] ability to protect\nhis own interests.” Ibid. Pp. 6–7. (b) Sections 1401 and 1409 date from an\nera when the Nation’s lawbooks were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. Today, such laws\nreceive the heightened scrutiny that now attends “all gender-based\nclassifications,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.\nT. B. , 511 U. S. 127 , including laws granting or denying\nbenefits “on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,” Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76 . Prescribing\none rule for mothers, another for fathers, §1409 is of the same\ngenre as the classifications declared unconstitutional in Westcott ; Reed v. Reed , 404 U. S. 71 –77; Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S. 636 –653;\nand Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207. A\nsuccessful defense therefore requires an “ ‘exceedingly\npersuasive justification.’ ” United States v. Virginia , 518 U. S. 515 . Pp. 7–9. (c) The Government must show, at least,\nthat its gender-based “ ‘classification serves “important\ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed”\nare “substantially related to [achieving] those\nobjectives.” ’ ” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533.\nThe classification must serve an important governmental interest today , for “new insights and societal understandings can\nreveal unjustified inequality . . . that once passed\nunnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges ,\n576 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 9–14. (1) At the time §1409 was enacted as part\nof the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), two once habitual, but\nnow untenable, assumptions pervaded the Nation’s citizenship laws\nand underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage,\nhusband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the sole\nguardian of a nonmarital child. In the 1940 Act, Congress codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.\nAccording to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified\nfor unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have\nscant contact with, their nonmarital children. Unwed citizen\nmothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father,\nalong with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.\nPp. 9–13. (2) For close to a half century, this\nCourt has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on “overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533. No “important [governmental] interest” is served by laws\ngrounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that\n“unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than\nmothers” to take responsibility for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441 U. S. 380 . In light of\nthis equal protection jurisprudence, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are\nanachronistic. Pp. 13–14. (d) The Government points to Fiallo v. Bell , 430 U. S. 787 ; Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53 , for support. But Fiallo involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not\npresent a claim of U. S. citizenship. And Miller and Nguyen addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well\nmet here, not the length of a parent’s prebirth residency in the\nUnited States. Pp. 14–16. (e) The Government’s suggested rationales\nfor §1409(a) and (c)’s gender-based differential do not survive\nheightened scrutiny. Pp. 16–23. (1) The Government asserts that Congress\nsought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection\nto the United States. The statute, the Government suggests,\nbracketed an unwed U. S.-citizen mother with a married couple\nin which both parents are U. S. citizens because she is the\nonly legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed\nU. S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a\ncitizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national\ninfluence of the alien mother. This rationale conforms to the\nlong-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.\nAnd the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested\ncongressional interest. Citizenship may be transmitted to children\nwho have no tie to the United States so long as their\nU. S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United\nStates for one year at any point in her life prior to the\nchild’s birth; but it may not be transmitted by a\nU. S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting\n§1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he\nacknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the\nchild in the United States. Pp. 17–19. (2) The Government also maintains that\nCongress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the\nforeign-born child of a U. S. citizen. But congressional\nhearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a\nstatelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence\nrequirements. Nor has the Government shown that the risk of\nstatelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Pp. 19–23. 2. Because this Court is not equipped to\nconvert §1409(c)’s exception for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers\ninto the main rule displacing §§1401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to\nCongress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor\ndisadvantages any person on the basis of gender. In the interim,\n§1401(a)(7)’s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to\nchildren born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. The\nlegislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs\nthe choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending\nfavorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable\ntreatment from the favored class. Ordinarily, the preferred rule is\nto extend favorable treatment. Westcott , 443 U. S., at\n89–90. Here, however, extension to fathers of §1409(c)’s favorable\ntreatment for mothers would displace Congress’ general rule, the\nlonger physical-presence requirements of §§1401(a)(7) and 1409\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers and\nU. S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the\nchild’s alien parent. Congress’ “ ‘commitment to th[is]\nresidual policy’ ” and “ ‘the degree of potential\ndisruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as\nopposed to abrogation,’ ” Heckler v. Mathews ,\n465 U. S. 728 , n. 5, indicate that Congress would likely\nhave abrogated §1409(c)’s special exception, preferring to preserve\n“the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of\ndedicated attachment,” Rogers v. Bellei , 401\nU. S. 815 . Pp. 23–28. 804 F. 3d 520, affirmed in part, reversed\nin part, and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed an opinion\nconcurring in the judgment in part, in which Alito, J., joined.\nGorsuch, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the\ncase.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1191 _________________ JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [June 12, 2017] Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case concerns a gender-based differential\nin the law governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a\nchild born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the\nother, a citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in\n8 U. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g)\n(2012 ed.). Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires a\nperiod of physical presence in the United States for the\nU. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially\nprescribed, was ten years’ physical presence prior to the child’s\nbirth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years\nprebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule is rendered\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a).\nCongress ordered an exception, however, for unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c), the exception\nallows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born\nabroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year\nprior to the child’s birth. The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón\nMorales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father\nwas just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)’s physical-presence\nrequirement. Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic,\nMorales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle\nimplicit in the Fifth Amendment[ 1 ] entitles him to citizenship stature. We hold that the\ngender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that\nthe Government accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Nevertheless, we cannot convert §1409(c)’s exception for\nunwed mothers into the main rule displacing §1401(a)(7) (covering\nmarried couples) and §1409(a) (covering unwed fathers). We must\ntherefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a\nphysical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other\nperiod) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one\nU. S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed. In the\ninterim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are\nadministered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination. I A We first describe in greater detail the regime\nCongress constructed. The general rules for acquiring U. S.\ncitizenship are found in 8 U. S. C. §1401, the first\nsection in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (1952 Act or INA), §301, 66Stat. 235–236. Section\n1401 sets forth the INA’s rules for determining who “shall be\nnationals and citizens of the United States at birth” by\nestablishing a range of residency and physical-presence\nrequirements calibrated primarily to the parents’ nationality and\nthe child’s place of birth. §1401(a) (1958 ed.); §1401 (2012 ed.).\nThe primacy of §1401 in the statutory scheme is evident.\nComprehensive in coverage, §1401 provides the general framework for\nthe acquisition of citizenship at birth. In particular, at the time\nrelevant here,[ 2 ] §1401(a)(7)\nprovided for the U. S. citizenship of “a person born outside the geographical\nlimits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents\none of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United\nStates who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically\npresent in the United States or its outlying possessions for a\nperiod or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five\nof which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided , That any periods of honorable service in the Armed\nForces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included\nin computing the physical presence requirements of this\nparagraph.” Congress has since reduced the duration\nrequirement to five years, two after age 14. §1401(g) (2012\ned.).[ 3 ] Section 1409 pertains specifically to children\nwith unmarried parents. Its first subsection, §1409(a),\nincorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of\n§1401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to\ntransmit U. S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the\nsame terms as a married citizen parent. Section 1409(c)—a provision\napplicable only to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers—states an\nexception to the physical-presence requirements of §§1401 and\n1409(a). Under §1409(c)’s exception, only one year of continuous\nphysical presence is required before unwed mothers may pass\ncitizenship to their children born abroad. B Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana moved to\nthe United States at age 13, and has resided in this country most\nof his life. Now facing deportation, he asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biological\nfather, José Morales, who accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household. José Morales was born in Guánica, Puerto Rico,\non March 19, 1900. Record 55–56. Puerto Rico was then, as it is\nnow, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle , 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 2–4); 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (“The term\nUnited States . . . means the continental United States,\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U. S.] Virgin\nIslands.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); §1101(a)(38) (2012\ned.) (similar), and José became a U. S. citizen under the\nOrganic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, §5, 39Stat. 953 (a predecessor\nto 8 U. S. C. §1402). After living in Puerto Rico for\nnearly two decades, José left his childhood home on February 27,\n1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. Record 57, 66. He did so to take up employment as a\nbuilder-mechanic for a U. S. company in the\nthen-U. S.-occupied Dominican Republic. Ibid. [ 4 ] By 1959, José attested in a June 21, 1971\naffidavit presented to the U. S. Embassy in the Dominican\nRepublic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Dominican\nwoman he would eventually marry. Id. , at 57. In 1962, Yrma\ngave birth to their child, respondent Luis Morales-Santana. Id. , at 166–167. While the record before us reveals little\nabout Morales-Santana’s childhood, the Dominican archives disclose\nthat Yrma and José married in 1970, and that José was then added to\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate as his father. Id. , at\n163–164, 167. José also related in the same affidavit that he was\nthen saving money “for the susten[ance] of [his] family” in\nanticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where members of\nhis family still resided. Id. , at 57. In 1975, when\nMorales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico, id. , at\n368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was attending public\nschool in the Bronx, a New York City borough, id. , at 140,\n369.[ 5 ] C In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana\nin removal proceedings based on several convictions for offenses\nunder New York State Penal Law, all of them rendered on May 17,\n1995. Id. , at 426. Morales-Santana ranked as an alien\ndespite the many years he lived in the United States, because, at\nthe time of his birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement\nof five years’ physical presence after age 14. See supra , at\n3–4, and n. 3. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s\nclaim to citizenship derived from the U. S. citizenship of his\nfather, and ordered Morales-Santana’s removal to the Dominican\nRepublic. Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a–49a. In 2010,\nMorales-Santana moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the\nGovernment’s refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from\nhis U. S.-citizen father violated the Constitution’s equal\nprotection guarantee. See Record 27, 45. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) denied the motion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a,\n42a–44a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the BIA’s decision. 804 F. 3d 520, 524\n(2015). Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of the equal\nprotection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications,\nthe court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed\nmothers and fathers. Id. , at 527–535. To cure the\nconstitutional flaw, the court further held that Morales-Santana\nderived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his\nmother the U. S. citizen. Id. , at 535–538. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit declined to follow the conflicting\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Flores-Villar , 536 F. 3d 990 (2008), see 804\nF. 3d, at 530, 535, n. 17. We granted certiorariin Flores-Villar , but ultimately affirmed by an equally divided\nCourt. Flores-Villar v. United States , 564 U. S.\n210 (2011) ( per curiam ). Taking up Morales-Santana’s\nrequest for review, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), we consider the\nmatter anew. II Because §1409 treats sons and daughters alike,\nMorales-Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based\ndiscrimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of\nMorales-Santana’s birth and was not accorded the right an unwed\nU. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her\nchild. Although the Government does not contend otherwise, we\nbriefly explain why Morales-Santana may seek to vindicate his\nfather’s right to the equal protection of the laws.[ 6 ] Ordinarily, a party “must assert his own legal\nrights” and “cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights\n. . . of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin ,\n422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975) . But we recognize an exception\nwhere, as here, “the party asserting the right has a close\nrelationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is\na hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his own\ninterests.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125,\n130 (2004) (quoting Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S.\n400, 411 (1991) ). José Morales’ ability to pass citizenship to his\nson, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies the “close\nrelationship” requirement. So, too, is the “hindrance” requirement\nwell met. José Morales’ failure to assert a claim in his own right\n“stems from disability,” not “disinterest,” Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420, 450 (1998) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), for José died in 1976, Record 140, many\nyears before the current controversy arose. See Hodel v. Irving , 481 U. S. 704 –712, 723, n. 7 (1987)\n(children and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights of\ndeceased relatives). Morales-Santana is thus the “obvious\nclaimant,” see Craig v. Boren , 429 U. S. 190,\n197 (1976) , the “best available proponent,” Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U. S. 106, 116 (1976) , of his father’s\nright to equal protection. III Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an\nera when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. See, e.g. , Hoyt v. Florida , 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961) (women\nare the “center of home and family life,” therefore they can be\n“relieved from the civic duty of jury service”); Goesaert v. Cleary , 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (States may draw “a\nsharp line between the sexes”). Today, laws of this kind are\nsubject to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends\n“all gender-based classifications.” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127, 136 (1994) ; see, e.g. , United States v. Virginia , 518\nU. S. 515 –556 (1996) (state-maintained military academy may\nnot deny admission to qualified women). Laws granting or denying benefits “on the basis\nof the sex of the qualifying parent,” our post-1970 decisions\naffirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore attract\nheightened review under the Constitution’s equal protection\nguarantee. Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76,\n84 (1979) ; see id. , at 88–89 (holding unconstitutional\nprovision of unemployed-parent benefits exclusively to fathers).\nAccord Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207\n(1977) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that denied widowers survivors’ benefits\navailable to widows); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420\nU. S. 636 –653 (1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that excluded fathers from receipt of\nchild-in-care benefits available to mothers); Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691 (1973) (plurality\nopinion) (holding unconstitutional exclusion of married female\nofficers in the military from benefits automatically accorded\nmarried male officers); cf. Reed v. Reed , 404\nU. S. 71 –77 (1971) (holding unconstitutional a probate-code\npreference for a father over a mother as administrator of a\ndeceased child’s estate).[ 7 ] Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for\nfathers, §1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we\ndeclared unconstitutional in Reed , Frontiero , Wiesenfeld , Goldfarb , and Westcott . As in\nthose cases, heightened scrutiny is in order. Successful defense of\nlegislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have\nreiterated, requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Kirchberg v. Feenstra , 450 U. S. 455,\n461 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). A The defender of legislation that\ndifferentiates on the basis of gender must show “at least that the\n[challenged] classification serves important governmental\nobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533 (quoting Mississippi\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan , 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982)\n; alteration in original); see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53, 60, 70 (2001) . Moreover, the\nclassification must substantially serve an important governmental\ninterest today , for “in interpreting the [e]qual\n[p]rotection [guarantee], [we have] recognized that new insights\nand societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality\n. . . that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 20). Here, the Government has supplied no\n“exceedingly persuasive justification,” Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted), for §1409(a)\nand (c)’s “gender-based” and “gender-biased” disparity, Westcott , 443 U. S., at 84 (internalquotation marks\nomitted). 1 History reveals what lurks behind §1409.\nEnacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54Stat.\n1139–1140, §1409 ended a century and a half of congressional\nsilence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed\nparents.[ 8 ] During this era,\ntwo once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our\nNation’s citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and\nadministrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife\nsubordinate; unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a\nnonmarital child. Under the once entrenched principle of male\ndominance in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.\n“[D]ominance [of] the husband,” this Court observed in 1915, “is an\nancient principle of our jurisprudence.” Mackenzie v. Hare , 239 U. S. 299, 311 (1915) .[ 9 ] See generally Brief for Professors of History\net al. as Amici Curiae 4–15. Through the early 20th\ncentury, a male citizen automatically conferred U. S.\ncitizenship on his alien wife. Act of Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, §2,\n10Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen , 7 Wall. 496, 498\n(1869) (the 1855 Act “confers the privileges of citizenship upon\nwomen married to citizens of the United States”); C. Bredbenner, A\nNationality of Her Own:Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship\n15–16, 20–21 (1998). A female citizen, however, was incapable of\nconferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was subject to\nexpatriation if she married an alien.[ 10 ] The family of a citizen or a lawfully admitted\npermanent resident enjoyed statutory exemptions from entry\nrequirements, but only if the citizen or resident was male. See, e.g. , Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §37, 32Stat. 1221\n(wives and children entering the country to join permanent-resident\naliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases during\ntransit shall not be deported if the diseases were easily curable\nor did not present a danger to others); S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st\nCong., 2d Sess., 415–417 (1950) (wives exempt from literacy and\nquota requirements). And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born\nchild of a married couple gained U. S. citizenship only\nthrough the father.[ 11 ] For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition\nnever held sway. Instead, the mother was regarded as the child’s\nnatural and sole guardian. At common law, the mother, and only the\nmother, was “bound to maintain [a nonmarital child] as its natural\nguardian.” 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *215–*216 (8th\ned. 1854); see Nguyen , 533 U. S., at 91–92 (O’Connor,\nJ., dissenting). In line with that understanding, in the early 20th\ncentury, the State Department sometimes permitted unwed mothers to\npass citizenship to their children, despite the absence of any\nstatutory authority for the practice. See Hearings on H. R.\n6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization,\n76th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings);\n39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 397–398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291\n(1939). See also Collins, Illegitimate Borders: Jus\nSanguinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family,\nRace, and Nation, 123 Yale L. J. 2134, 2199–2205 (2014)\n(hereinafter Collins). In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the\nfather-controls assumption concerning married parents, but codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried parents.\nThe Roosevelt administration, which proposed §1409, explained:\n“[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child] stands in the place of the\nfather . . . [,] has a right tothe custody and control of\nsuch a child as against the putative father, and is bound to\nmaintain it as its natu-ral guardian.” 1940 Hearings 431 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion\nrenders §1409’s gender-based residency rules understandable.\nFearing that a foreign-born child could turn out “more alien than\nAmerican in character,” the administration believed that a citizen\nparent with lengthy ties to the United States would counteract the\ninfluence of the alien parent. Id. , at 426–427. Concern\nabout the attachment of foreign-born children to the United States\nexplains the treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to\nthe familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have scant\ncontact with, their nonmarital children. For unwed citizen mothers,\nhowever, there was no need for a prolonged residency prophylactic:\nThe alien father, who might transmit foreign ways, was\npresumptively out of the picture. See id. , at 431; Collins\n2203 (in “nearly uniform view” of U. S. officials, “almost\ninvariably,” the mother alone “concern[ed] herself with [a\nnonmarital] child” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 2 For close to a half century, as earlier\nobserved, see supra , at 7–8, this Court has viewed with\nsuspicion laws that rely on “overbroad generalizations about the\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and\nfemales.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S., at 643, 648. In particular, we\nhave recognized that if a “statutory objective is to exclude or\n‘protect’ members of one gender” in reliance on “fixed notions\nconcerning [that gender’s] roles and abilities,” the “objective\nitself is illegitimate.” Mississippi Univ. for Women , 458\nU. S., at 725. In accord with this eventual understanding, the\nCourt has held that no “important [governmental] interest” is\nserved by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the\nobsolescing view that “unwed fathers [are] invariably less\nqualified and entitled than mothers” to take responsibility for\nnonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441\nU. S. 380, 382, 394 (1979) .[ 12 ] Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court\nhas come to comprehend, have a constraining impact, descriptive\nthough they may be of the way many people still order their\nlives.[ 13 ] Laws according or\ndenying benefits in reliance on “[s]tereotypes about women’s\ndomestic roles,” the Court has observed, may “creat[e] a\nself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that force[s] women to\ncontinue to assume the role of primary family caregiver.” Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721,\n736 (2003) . Correspondingly, such laws may disserve men who\nexercise responsibility for raising their children. See ibid. In light of the equal protection jurisprudence this\nCourt has developed since 1971, see Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531–534, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers\nwho have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly\nanachronistic. B In urging this Court nevertheless to reject\nMorales-Santana’s equal protection plea, the Government cites three\ndecisions of this Court: Fiallo v. Bell , 430\nU. S. 787 (1977) ; Miller v. Albright , 523\nU. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53\n. None controls this case. The 1952 Act provision at issue in Fiallo gave special immigration preferences to alien children of citizen\n(or lawful-permanent-resident) mothers, and to alien unwed mothers\nof citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children. 430 U. S.,\nat 788–789, and n. 1. Unwed fathers and their children,\nasserting their right to equal protection, sought the same\npreferences. Id. , at 791. Applying minimal scrutiny\n(rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on\nCongress’ “exceptionally broad power” to admit or exclude aliens. Id. , at 792, 794.[ 14 ]\nThis case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.\nMorales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a\nU. S. citizen. Examining a claim of that order, the Court has\nnot disclaimed, as it did in Fiallo , the application of an\nexacting standard of review. See Nguyen , 533 U. S., at\n60–61, 70; Miller , 523 U. S., at 434–435, n. ",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL v .\nMORALES-SANTANA certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit No. 15–1191. Argued November 9, 2016—Decided\nJune 12, 2017 The Immigration and Nationality Act provides\nthe framework for acquisition of U. S. citizenship from birth\nby a child born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen and\nthe other a citizen of another nation. Applicable to married\ncouples, the main rule in effect at the time here relevant, 8\nU. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), required the\nU. S.-citizen parent to have ten years’ physical presence in\nthe United States prior to the child’s birth, “at least five of\nwhich were after attaining” age 14. The rule is made applicable to\nunwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a), but §1409(c) creates\nan exception for an unwed U. S.-citizen mother, whose\ncitizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has\nlived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to\nthe child’s birth. Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana, who has\nlived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the U. S. citizenship of his\nbiological father, José Morales. José moved to the Dominican\nRepublic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave\nbirth to Morales-Santana. José accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household; he married\nMorales-Santana’s mother and his name was then added to hers on\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate. In 2000, the Government sought\nto remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions,\nranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did\nnot satisfy the requirement of five years’ physical presence after\nage 14. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s citizenship\nclaim and ordered his removal. Morales-Santana later moved to\nreopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government’s refusal to\nrecognize that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen\nfather violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. The\nBoard of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of\nthe equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based\nclassifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential\ntreatment of unwed mothers and fathers. To cure this infirmity, the\nCourt of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship\nthrough his father, just as he would were his mother the U. S.\ncitizen. Held : 1. The gender line Congress drew is\nincompatible with the Fifth Amendment’s requirement that the\nGovernment accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Pp. 6–23. (a) Morales-Santana satisfies the\nrequirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his\nfather’s right to equal protection. José Morales’ ability to pass\ncitizenship to his son easily satisfies the requirement that the\nthird party have a “ ‘close’ relationship with the person who\npossesses the right.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543\nU. S. 125 . And José’s death many years before the current\ncontroversy arose is “a ‘hindrance’ to [José’s] ability to protect\nhis own interests.” Ibid. Pp. 6–7. (b) Sections 1401 and 1409 date from an\nera when the Nation’s lawbooks were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. Today, such laws\nreceive the heightened scrutiny that now attends “all gender-based\nclassifications,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.\nT. B. , 511 U. S. 127 , including laws granting or denying\nbenefits “on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,” Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76 . Prescribing\none rule for mothers, another for fathers, §1409 is of the same\ngenre as the classifications declared unconstitutional in Westcott ; Reed v. Reed , 404 U. S. 71 –77; Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S. 636 –653;\nand Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207. A\nsuccessful defense therefore requires an “ ‘exceedingly\npersuasive justification.’ ” United States v. Virginia , 518 U. S. 515 . Pp. 7–9. (c) The Government must show, at least,\nthat its gender-based “ ‘classification serves “important\ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed”\nare “substantially related to [achieving] those\nobjectives.” ’ ” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533.\nThe classification must serve an important governmental interest today , for “new insights and societal understandings can\nreveal unjustified inequality . . . that once passed\nunnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges ,\n576 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 9–14. (1) At the time §1409 was enacted as part\nof the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), two once habitual, but\nnow untenable, assumptions pervaded the Nation’s citizenship laws\nand underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage,\nhusband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the sole\nguardian of a nonmarital child. In the 1940 Act, Congress codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.\nAccording to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified\nfor unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have\nscant contact with, their nonmarital children. Unwed citizen\nmothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father,\nalong with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.\nPp. 9–13. (2) For close to a half century, this\nCourt has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on “overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533. No “important [governmental] interest” is served by laws\ngrounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that\n“unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than\nmothers” to take responsibility for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441 U. S. 380 . In light of\nthis equal protection jurisprudence, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are\nanachronistic. Pp. 13–14. (d) The Government points to Fiallo v. Bell , 430 U. S. 787 ; Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53 , for support. But Fiallo involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not\npresent a claim of U. S. citizenship. And Miller and Nguyen addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well\nmet here, not the length of a parent’s prebirth residency in the\nUnited States. Pp. 14–16. (e) The Government’s suggested rationales\nfor §1409(a) and (c)’s gender-based differential do not survive\nheightened scrutiny. Pp. 16–23. (1) The Government asserts that Congress\nsought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection\nto the United States. The statute, the Government suggests,\nbracketed an unwed U. S.-citizen mother with a married couple\nin which both parents are U. S. citizens because she is the\nonly legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed\nU. S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a\ncitizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national\ninfluence of the alien mother. This rationale conforms to the\nlong-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.\nAnd the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested\ncongressional interest. Citizenship may be transmitted to children\nwho have no tie to the United States so long as their\nU. S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United\nStates for one year at any point in her life prior to the\nchild’s birth; but it may not be transmitted by a\nU. S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting\n§1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he\nacknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the\nchild in the United States. Pp. 17–19. (2) The Government also maintains that\nCongress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the\nforeign-born child of a U. S. citizen. But congressional\nhearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a\nstatelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence\nrequirements. Nor has the Government shown that the risk of\nstatelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Pp. 19–23. 2. Because this Court is not equipped to\nconvert §1409(c)’s exception for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers\ninto the main rule displacing §§1401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to\nCongress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor\ndisadvantages any person on the basis of gender. In the interim,\n§1401(a)(7)’s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to\nchildren born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. The\nlegislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs\nthe choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending\nfavorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable\ntreatment from the favored class. Ordinarily, the preferred rule is\nto extend favorable treatment. Westcott , 443 U. S., at\n89–90. Here, however, extension to fathers of §1409(c)’s favorable\ntreatment for mothers would displace Congress’ general rule, the\nlonger physical-presence requirements of §§1401(a)(7) and 1409\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers and\nU. S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the\nchild’s alien parent. Congress’ “ ‘commitment to th[is]\nresidual policy’ ” and “ ‘the degree of potential\ndisruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as\nopposed to abrogation,’ ” Heckler v. Mathews ,\n465 U. S. 728 , n. 5, indicate that Congress would likely\nhave abrogated §1409(c)’s special exception, preferring to preserve\n“the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of\ndedicated attachment,” Rogers v. Bellei , 401\nU. S. 815 . Pp. 23–28. 804 F. 3d 520, affirmed in part, reversed\nin part, and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed an opinion\nconcurring in the judgment in part, in which Alito, J., joined.\nGorsuch, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the\ncase.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1191 _________________ JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [June 12, 2017] Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case concerns a gender-based differential\nin the law governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a\nchild born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the\nother, a citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in\n8 U. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g)\n(2012 ed.). Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires a\nperiod of physical presence in the United States for the\nU. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially\nprescribed, was ten years’ physical presence prior to the child’s\nbirth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years\nprebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule is rendered\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a).\nCongress ordered an exception, however, for unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c), the exception\nallows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born\nabroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year\nprior to the child’s birth. The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón\nMorales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father\nwas just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)’s physical-presence\nrequirement. Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic,\nMorales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle\nimplicit in the Fifth Amendment[ 1 ] entitles him to citizenship stature. We hold that the\ngender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that\nthe Government accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Nevertheless, we cannot convert §1409(c)’s exception for\nunwed mothers into the main rule displacing §1401(a)(7) (covering\nmarried couples) and §1409(a) (covering unwed fathers). We must\ntherefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a\nphysical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other\nperiod) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one\nU. S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed. In the\ninterim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are\nadministered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination. I A We first describe in greater detail the regime\nCongress constructed. The general rules for acquiring U. S.\ncitizenship are found in 8 U. S. C. §1401, the first\nsection in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (1952 Act or INA), §301, 66Stat. 235–236. Section\n1401 sets forth the INA’s rules for determining who “shall be\nnationals and citizens of the United States at birth” by\nestablishing a range of residency and physical-presence\nrequirements calibrated primarily to the parents’ nationality and\nthe child’s place of birth. §1401(a) (1958 ed.); §1401 (2012 ed.).\nThe primacy of §1401 in the statutory scheme is evident.\nComprehensive in coverage, §1401 provides the general framework for\nthe acquisition of citizenship at birth. In particular, at the time\nrelevant here,[ 2 ] §1401(a)(7)\nprovided for the U. S. citizenship of “a person born outside the geographical\nlimits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents\none of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United\nStates who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically\npresent in the United States or its outlying possessions for a\nperiod or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five\nof which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided , That any periods of honorable service in the Armed\nForces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included\nin computing the physical presence requirements of this\nparagraph.” Congress has since reduced the duration\nrequirement to five years, two after age 14. §1401(g) (2012\ned.).[ 3 ] Section 1409 pertains specifically to children\nwith unmarried parents. Its first subsection, §1409(a),\nincorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of\n§1401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to\ntransmit U. S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the\nsame terms as a married citizen parent. Section 1409(c)—a provision\napplicable only to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers—states an\nexception to the physical-presence requirements of §§1401 and\n1409(a). Under §1409(c)’s exception, only one year of continuous\nphysical presence is required before unwed mothers may pass\ncitizenship to their children born abroad. B Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana moved to\nthe United States at age 13, and has resided in this country most\nof his life. Now facing deportation, he asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biological\nfather, José Morales, who accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household. José Morales was born in Guánica, Puerto Rico,\non March 19, 1900. Record 55–56. Puerto Rico was then, as it is\nnow, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle , 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 2–4); 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (“The term\nUnited States . . . means the continental United States,\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U. S.] Virgin\nIslands.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); §1101(a)(38) (2012\ned.) (similar), and José became a U. S. citizen under the\nOrganic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, §5, 39Stat. 953 (a predecessor\nto 8 U. S. C. §1402). After living in Puerto Rico for\nnearly two decades, José left his childhood home on February 27,\n1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. Record 57, 66. He did so to take up employment as a\nbuilder-mechanic for a U. S. company in the\nthen-U. S.-occupied Dominican Republic. Ibid. [ 4 ] By 1959, José attested in a June 21, 1971\naffidavit presented to the U. S. Embassy in the Dominican\nRepublic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Dominican\nwoman he would eventually marry. Id. , at 57. In 1962, Yrma\ngave birth to their child, respondent Luis Morales-Santana. Id. , at 166–167. While the record before us reveals little\nabout Morales-Santana’s childhood, the Dominican archives disclose\nthat Yrma and José married in 1970, and that José was then added to\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate as his father. Id. , at\n163–164, 167. José also related in the same affidavit that he was\nthen saving money “for the susten[ance] of [his] family” in\nanticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where members of\nhis family still resided. Id. , at 57. In 1975, when\nMorales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico, id. , at\n368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was attending public\nschool in the Bronx, a New York City borough, id. , at 140,\n369.[ 5 ] C In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana\nin removal proceedings based on several convictions for offenses\nunder New York State Penal Law, all of them rendered on May 17,\n1995. Id. , at 426. Morales-Santana ranked as an alien\ndespite the many years he lived in the United States, because, at\nthe time of his birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement\nof five years’ physical presence after age 14. See supra , at\n3–4, and n. 3. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s\nclaim to citizenship derived from the U. S. citizenship of his\nfather, and ordered Morales-Santana’s removal to the Dominican\nRepublic. Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a–49a. In 2010,\nMorales-Santana moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the\nGovernment’s refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from\nhis U. S.-citizen father violated the Constitution’s equal\nprotection guarantee. See Record 27, 45. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) denied the motion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a,\n42a–44a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the BIA’s decision. 804 F. 3d 520, 524\n(2015). Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of the equal\nprotection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications,\nthe court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed\nmothers and fathers. Id. , at 527–535. To cure the\nconstitutional flaw, the court further held that Morales-Santana\nderived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his\nmother the U. S. citizen. Id. , at 535–538. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit declined to follow the conflicting\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Flores-Villar , 536 F. 3d 990 (2008), see 804\nF. 3d, at 530, 535, n. 17. We granted certiorariin Flores-Villar , but ultimately affirmed by an equally divided\nCourt. Flores-Villar v. United States , 564 U. S.\n210 (2011) ( per curiam ). Taking up Morales-Santana’s\nrequest for review, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), we consider the\nmatter anew. II Because §1409 treats sons and daughters alike,\nMorales-Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based\ndiscrimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of\nMorales-Santana’s birth and was not accorded the right an unwed\nU. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her\nchild. Although the Government does not contend otherwise, we\nbriefly explain why Morales-Santana may seek to vindicate his\nfather’s right to the equal protection of the laws.[ 6 ] Ordinarily, a party “must assert his own legal\nrights” and “cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights\n. . . of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin ,\n422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975) . But we recognize an exception\nwhere, as here, “the party asserting the right has a close\nrelationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is\na hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his own\ninterests.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125,\n130 (2004) (quoting Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S.\n400, 411 (1991) ). José Morales’ ability to pass citizenship to his\nson, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies the “close\nrelationship” requirement. So, too, is the “hindrance” requirement\nwell met. José Morales’ failure to assert a claim in his own right\n“stems from disability,” not “disinterest,” Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420, 450 (1998) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), for José died in 1976, Record 140, many\nyears before the current controversy arose. See Hodel v. Irving , 481 U. S. 704 –712, 723, n. 7 (1987)\n(children and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights of\ndeceased relatives). Morales-Santana is thus the “obvious\nclaimant,” see Craig v. Boren , 429 U. S. 190,\n197 (1976) , the “best available proponent,” Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U. S. 106, 116 (1976) , of his father’s\nright to equal protection. III Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an\nera when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. See, e.g. , Hoyt v. Florida , 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961) (women\nare the “center of home and family life,” therefore they can be\n“relieved from the civic duty of jury service”); Goesaert v. Cleary , 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (States may draw “a\nsharp line between the sexes”). Today, laws of this kind are\nsubject to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends\n“all gender-based classifications.” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127, 136 (1994) ; see, e.g. , United States v. Virginia , 518\nU. S. 515 –556 (1996) (state-maintained military academy may\nnot deny admission to qualified women). Laws granting or denying benefits “on the basis\nof the sex of the qualifying parent,” our post-1970 decisions\naffirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore attract\nheightened review under the Constitution’s equal protection\nguarantee. Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76,\n84 (1979) ; see id. , at 88–89 (holding unconstitutional\nprovision of unemployed-parent benefits exclusively to fathers).\nAccord Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207\n(1977) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that denied widowers survivors’ benefits\navailable to widows); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420\nU. S. 636 –653 (1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that excluded fathers from receipt of\nchild-in-care benefits available to mothers); Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691 (1973) (plurality\nopinion) (holding unconstitutional exclusion of married female\nofficers in the military from benefits automatically accorded\nmarried male officers); cf. Reed v. Reed , 404\nU. S. 71 –77 (1971) (holding unconstitutional a probate-code\npreference for a father over a mother as administrator of a\ndeceased child’s estate).[ 7 ] Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for\nfathers, §1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we\ndeclared unconstitutional in Reed , Frontiero , Wiesenfeld , Goldfarb , and Westcott . As in\nthose cases, heightened scrutiny is in order. Successful defense of\nlegislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have\nreiterated, requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Kirchberg v. Feenstra , 450 U. S. 455,\n461 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). A The defender of legislation that\ndifferentiates on the basis of gender must show “at least that the\n[challenged] classification serves important governmental\nobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533 (quoting Mississippi\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan , 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982)\n; alteration in original); see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53, 60, 70 (2001) . Moreover, the\nclassification must substantially serve an important governmental\ninterest today , for “in interpreting the [e]qual\n[p]rotection [guarantee], [we have] recognized that new insights\nand societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality\n. . . that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 20). Here, the Government has supplied no\n“exceedingly persuasive justification,” Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted), for §1409(a)\nand (c)’s “gender-based” and “gender-biased” disparity, Westcott , 443 U. S., at 84 (internalquotation marks\nomitted). 1 History reveals what lurks behind §1409.\nEnacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54Stat.\n1139–1140, §1409 ended a century and a half of congressional\nsilence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed\nparents.[ 8 ] During this era,\ntwo once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our\nNation’s citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and\nadministrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife\nsubordinate; unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a\nnonmarital child. Under the once entrenched principle of male\ndominance in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.\n“[D]ominance [of] the husband,” this Court observed in 1915, “is an\nancient principle of our jurisprudence.” Mackenzie v. Hare , 239 U. S. 299, 311 (1915) .[ 9 ] See generally Brief for Professors of History\net al. as Amici Curiae 4–15. Through the early 20th\ncentury, a male citizen automatically conferred U. S.\ncitizenship on his alien wife. Act of Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, §2,\n10Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen , 7 Wall. 496, 498\n(1869) (the 1855 Act “confers the privileges of citizenship upon\nwomen married to citizens of the United States”); C. Bredbenner, A\nNationality of Her Own:Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship\n15–16, 20–21 (1998). A female citizen, however, was incapable of\nconferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was subject to\nexpatriation if she married an alien.[ 10 ] The family of a citizen or a lawfully admitted\npermanent resident enjoyed statutory exemptions from entry\nrequirements, but only if the citizen or resident was male. See, e.g. , Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §37, 32Stat. 1221\n(wives and children entering the country to join permanent-resident\naliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases during\ntransit shall not be deported if the diseases were easily curable\nor did not present a danger to others); S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st\nCong., 2d Sess., 415–417 (1950) (wives exempt from literacy and\nquota requirements). And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born\nchild of a married couple gained U. S. citizenship only\nthrough the father.[ 11 ] For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition\nnever held sway. Instead, the mother was regarded as the child’s\nnatural and sole guardian. At common law, the mother, and only the\nmother, was “bound to maintain [a nonmarital child] as its natural\nguardian.” 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *215–*216 (8th\ned. 1854); see Nguyen , 533 U. S., at 91–92 (O’Connor,\nJ., dissenting). In line with that understanding, in the early 20th\ncentury, the State Department sometimes permitted unwed mothers to\npass citizenship to their children, despite the absence of any\nstatutory authority for the practice. See Hearings on H. R.\n6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization,\n76th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings);\n39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 397–398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291\n(1939). See also Collins, Illegitimate Borders: Jus\nSanguinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family,\nRace, and Nation, 123 Yale L. J. 2134, 2199–2205 (2014)\n(hereinafter Collins). In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the\nfather-controls assumption concerning married parents, but codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried parents.\nThe Roosevelt administration, which proposed §1409, explained:\n“[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child] stands in the place of the\nfather . . . [,] has a right tothe custody and control of\nsuch a child as against the putative father, and is bound to\nmaintain it as its natu-ral guardian.” 1940 Hearings 431 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion\nrenders §1409’s gender-based residency rules understandable.\nFearing that a foreign-born child could turn out “more alien than\nAmerican in character,” the administration believed that a citizen\nparent with lengthy ties to the United States would counteract the\ninfluence of the alien parent. Id. , at 426–427. Concern\nabout the attachment of foreign-born children to the United States\nexplains the treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to\nthe familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have scant\ncontact with, their nonmarital children. For unwed citizen mothers,\nhowever, there was no need for a prolonged residency prophylactic:\nThe alien father, who might transmit foreign ways, was\npresumptively out of the picture. See id. , at 431; Collins\n2203 (in “nearly uniform view” of U. S. officials, “almost\ninvariably,” the mother alone “concern[ed] herself with [a\nnonmarital] child” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 2 For close to a half century, as earlier\nobserved, see supra , at 7–8, this Court has viewed with\nsuspicion laws that rely on “overbroad generalizations about the\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and\nfemales.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S., at 643, 648. In particular, we\nhave recognized that if a “statutory objective is to exclude or\n‘protect’ members of one gender” in reliance on “fixed notions\nconcerning [that gender’s] roles and abilities,” the “objective\nitself is illegitimate.” Mississippi Univ. for Women , 458\nU. S., at 725. In accord with this eventual understanding, the\nCourt has held that no “important [governmental] interest” is\nserved by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the\nobsolescing view that “unwed fathers [are] invariably less\nqualified and entitled than mothers” to take responsibility for\nnonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441\nU. S. 380, 382, 394 (1979) .[ 12 ] Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court\nhas come to comprehend, have a constraining impact, descriptive\nthough they may be of the way many people still order their\nlives.[ 13 ] Laws according or\ndenying benefits in reliance on “[s]tereotypes about women’s\ndomestic roles,” the Court has observed, may “creat[e] a\nself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that force[s] women to\ncontinue to assume the role of primary family caregiver.” Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721,\n736 (2003) . Correspondingly, such laws may disserve men who\nexercise responsibility for raising their children. See ibid. In light of the equal protection jurisprudence this\nCourt has developed since 1971, see Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531–534, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers\nwho have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly\nanachronistic. B In urging this Court nevertheless to reject\nMorales-Santana’s equal protection plea, the Government cites three\ndecisions of this Court: Fiallo v. Bell , 430\nU. S. 787 (1977) ; Miller v. Albright , 523\nU. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53\n. None controls this case. The 1952 Act provision at issue in Fiallo gave special immigration preferences to alien children of citizen\n(or lawful-permanent-resident) mothers, and to alien unwed mothers\nof citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children. 430 U. S.,\nat 788–789, and n. 1. Unwed fathers and their children,\nasserting their right to equal protection, sought the same\npreferences. Id. , at 791. Applying minimal scrutiny\n(rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on\nCongress’ “exceptionally broad power” to admit or exclude aliens. Id. , at 792, 794.[ 14 ]\nThis case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.\nMorales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a\nU. S. citizen. Examining a claim of that order, the Court has\nnot disclaimed, as it did in Fiallo , the application of an\nexacting standard of review. See Nguyen , 533 U. S., at\n60–61, 70; Miller , 523 U. S., at 434–435, n. ",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL v .\nMORALES-SANTANA certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the second circuit No. 15–1191. Argued November 9, 2016—Decided\nJune 12, 2017 The Immigration and Nationality Act provides\nthe framework for acquisition of U. S. citizenship from birth\nby a child born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen and\nthe other a citizen of another nation. Applicable to married\ncouples, the main rule in effect at the time here relevant, 8\nU. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), required the\nU. S.-citizen parent to have ten years’ physical presence in\nthe United States prior to the child’s birth, “at least five of\nwhich were after attaining” age 14. The rule is made applicable to\nunwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a), but §1409(c) creates\nan exception for an unwed U. S.-citizen mother, whose\ncitizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has\nlived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to\nthe child’s birth. Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana, who has\nlived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the U. S. citizenship of his\nbiological father, José Morales. José moved to the Dominican\nRepublic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave\nbirth to Morales-Santana. José accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household; he married\nMorales-Santana’s mother and his name was then added to hers on\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate. In 2000, the Government sought\nto remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions,\nranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did\nnot satisfy the requirement of five years’ physical presence after\nage 14. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s citizenship\nclaim and ordered his removal. Morales-Santana later moved to\nreopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government’s refusal to\nrecognize that he derived citizenship from his U. S.-citizen\nfather violated the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. The\nBoard of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second\nCircuit reversed. Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of\nthe equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based\nclassifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential\ntreatment of unwed mothers and fathers. To cure this infirmity, the\nCourt of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship\nthrough his father, just as he would were his mother the U. S.\ncitizen. Held : 1. The gender line Congress drew is\nincompatible with the Fifth Amendment’s requirement that the\nGovernment accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Pp. 6–23. (a) Morales-Santana satisfies the\nrequirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his\nfather’s right to equal protection. José Morales’ ability to pass\ncitizenship to his son easily satisfies the requirement that the\nthird party have a “ ‘close’ relationship with the person who\npossesses the right.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543\nU. S. 125 . And José’s death many years before the current\ncontroversy arose is “a ‘hindrance’ to [José’s] ability to protect\nhis own interests.” Ibid. Pp. 6–7. (b) Sections 1401 and 1409 date from an\nera when the Nation’s lawbooks were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. Today, such laws\nreceive the heightened scrutiny that now attends “all gender-based\nclassifications,” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel.\nT. B. , 511 U. S. 127 , including laws granting or denying\nbenefits “on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,” Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76 . Prescribing\none rule for mothers, another for fathers, §1409 is of the same\ngenre as the classifications declared unconstitutional in Westcott ; Reed v. Reed , 404 U. S. 71 –77; Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S. 636 –653;\nand Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207. A\nsuccessful defense therefore requires an “ ‘exceedingly\npersuasive justification.’ ” United States v. Virginia , 518 U. S. 515 . Pp. 7–9. (c) The Government must show, at least,\nthat its gender-based “ ‘classification serves “important\ngovernmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed”\nare “substantially related to [achieving] those\nobjectives.” ’ ” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533.\nThe classification must serve an important governmental interest today , for “new insights and societal understandings can\nreveal unjustified inequality . . . that once passed\nunnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges ,\n576 U. S. ___, ___. Pp. 9–14. (1) At the time §1409 was enacted as part\nof the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), two once habitual, but\nnow untenable, assumptions pervaded the Nation’s citizenship laws\nand underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage,\nhusband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the sole\nguardian of a nonmarital child. In the 1940 Act, Congress codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.\nAccording to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified\nfor unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have\nscant contact with, their nonmarital children. Unwed citizen\nmothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father,\nalong with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.\nPp. 9–13. (2) For close to a half century, this\nCourt has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on “overbroad\ngeneralizations about the different talents, capacities, or\npreferences of males and females.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533. No “important [governmental] interest” is served by laws\ngrounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that\n“unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than\nmothers” to take responsibility for nonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441 U. S. 380 . In light of\nthis equal protection jurisprudence, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are\nanachronistic. Pp. 13–14. (d) The Government points to Fiallo v. Bell , 430 U. S. 787 ; Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53 , for support. But Fiallo involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not\npresent a claim of U. S. citizenship. And Miller and Nguyen addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well\nmet here, not the length of a parent’s prebirth residency in the\nUnited States. Pp. 14–16. (e) The Government’s suggested rationales\nfor §1409(a) and (c)’s gender-based differential do not survive\nheightened scrutiny. Pp. 16–23. (1) The Government asserts that Congress\nsought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection\nto the United States. The statute, the Government suggests,\nbracketed an unwed U. S.-citizen mother with a married couple\nin which both parents are U. S. citizens because she is the\nonly legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed\nU. S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a\ncitizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national\ninfluence of the alien mother. This rationale conforms to the\nlong-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.\nAnd the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested\ncongressional interest. Citizenship may be transmitted to children\nwho have no tie to the United States so long as their\nU. S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United\nStates for one year at any point in her life prior to the\nchild’s birth; but it may not be transmitted by a\nU. S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting\n§1401(a)(7)’s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he\nacknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the\nchild in the United States. Pp. 17–19. (2) The Government also maintains that\nCongress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the\nforeign-born child of a U. S. citizen. But congressional\nhearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a\nstatelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence\nrequirements. Nor has the Government shown that the risk of\nstatelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Pp. 19–23. 2. Because this Court is not equipped to\nconvert §1409(c)’s exception for unwed U. S.-citizen mothers\ninto the main rule displacing §§1401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to\nCongress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor\ndisadvantages any person on the basis of gender. In the interim,\n§1401(a)(7)’s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to\nchildren born to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers. The\nlegislature’s intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs\nthe choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending\nfavorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable\ntreatment from the favored class. Ordinarily, the preferred rule is\nto extend favorable treatment. Westcott , 443 U. S., at\n89–90. Here, however, extension to fathers of §1409(c)’s favorable\ntreatment for mothers would displace Congress’ general rule, the\nlonger physical-presence requirements of §§1401(a)(7) and 1409\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers and\nU. S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the\nchild’s alien parent. Congress’ “ ‘commitment to th[is]\nresidual policy’ ” and “ ‘the degree of potential\ndisruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as\nopposed to abrogation,’ ” Heckler v. Mathews ,\n465 U. S. 728 , n. 5, indicate that Congress would likely\nhave abrogated §1409(c)’s special exception, preferring to preserve\n“the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of\ndedicated attachment,” Rogers v. Bellei , 401\nU. S. 815 . Pp. 23–28. 804 F. 3d 520, affirmed in part, reversed\nin part, and remanded. Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed an opinion\nconcurring in the judgment in part, in which Alito, J., joined.\nGorsuch, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the\ncase.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1191 _________________ JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL,\nPETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the second circuit [June 12, 2017] Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case concerns a gender-based differential\nin the law governing acquisition of U. S. citizenship by a\nchild born abroad, when one parent is a U. S. citizen, the\nother, a citizen of another nation. The main rule appears in\n8 U. S. C. §1401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now §1401(g)\n(2012 ed.). Applicable to married couples, §1401(a)(7) requires a\nperiod of physical presence in the United States for the\nU. S.-citizen parent. The requirement, as initially\nprescribed, was ten years’ physical presence prior to the child’s\nbirth, §601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years\nprebirth, §1401(g) (2012 ed.). That main rule is rendered\napplicable to unwed U. S.-citizen fathers by §1409(a).\nCongress ordered an exception, however, for unwed\nU. S.-citizen mothers. Contained in §1409(c), the exception\nallows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born\nabroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year\nprior to the child’s birth. The respondent in this case, Luis Ramón\nMorales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father\nwas just 20 days short of meeting §1401(a)(7)’s physical-presence\nrequirement. Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic,\nMorales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle\nimplicit in the Fifth Amendment[ 1 ] entitles him to citizenship stature. We hold that the\ngender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that\nthe Government accord to all persons “the equal protection of the\nlaws.” Nevertheless, we cannot convert §1409(c)’s exception for\nunwed mothers into the main rule displacing §1401(a)(7) (covering\nmarried couples) and §1409(a) (covering unwed fathers). We must\ntherefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a\nphysical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other\nperiod) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one\nU. S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed. In the\ninterim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are\nadministered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination. I A We first describe in greater detail the regime\nCongress constructed. The general rules for acquiring U. S.\ncitizenship are found in 8 U. S. C. §1401, the first\nsection in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and\nNationality Act (1952 Act or INA), §301, 66Stat. 235–236. Section\n1401 sets forth the INA’s rules for determining who “shall be\nnationals and citizens of the United States at birth” by\nestablishing a range of residency and physical-presence\nrequirements calibrated primarily to the parents’ nationality and\nthe child’s place of birth. §1401(a) (1958 ed.); §1401 (2012 ed.).\nThe primacy of §1401 in the statutory scheme is evident.\nComprehensive in coverage, §1401 provides the general framework for\nthe acquisition of citizenship at birth. In particular, at the time\nrelevant here,[ 2 ] §1401(a)(7)\nprovided for the U. S. citizenship of “a person born outside the geographical\nlimits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents\none of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United\nStates who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically\npresent in the United States or its outlying possessions for a\nperiod or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five\nof which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided , That any periods of honorable service in the Armed\nForces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included\nin computing the physical presence requirements of this\nparagraph.” Congress has since reduced the duration\nrequirement to five years, two after age 14. §1401(g) (2012\ned.).[ 3 ] Section 1409 pertains specifically to children\nwith unmarried parents. Its first subsection, §1409(a),\nincorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of\n§1401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to\ntransmit U. S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the\nsame terms as a married citizen parent. Section 1409(c)—a provision\napplicable only to unwed U. S.-citizen mothers—states an\nexception to the physical-presence requirements of §§1401 and\n1409(a). Under §1409(c)’s exception, only one year of continuous\nphysical presence is required before unwed mothers may pass\ncitizenship to their children born abroad. B Respondent Luis Ramón Morales-Santana moved to\nthe United States at age 13, and has resided in this country most\nof his life. Now facing deportation, he asserts U. S.\ncitizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biological\nfather, José Morales, who accepted parental responsibility and\nincluded Morales-Santana in his household. José Morales was born in Guánica, Puerto Rico,\non March 19, 1900. Record 55–56. Puerto Rico was then, as it is\nnow, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle , 579 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2016) (slip op.,\nat 2–4); 8 U. S. C. §1101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (“The term\nUnited States . . . means the continental United States,\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U. S.] Virgin\nIslands.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); §1101(a)(38) (2012\ned.) (similar), and José became a U. S. citizen under the\nOrganic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, §5, 39Stat. 953 (a predecessor\nto 8 U. S. C. §1402). After living in Puerto Rico for\nnearly two decades, José left his childhood home on February 27,\n1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to\nsatisfy §1401(a)(7)’s requirement of five years’ physical presence\nafter age 14. Record 57, 66. He did so to take up employment as a\nbuilder-mechanic for a U. S. company in the\nthen-U. S.-occupied Dominican Republic. Ibid. [ 4 ] By 1959, José attested in a June 21, 1971\naffidavit presented to the U. S. Embassy in the Dominican\nRepublic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Dominican\nwoman he would eventually marry. Id. , at 57. In 1962, Yrma\ngave birth to their child, respondent Luis Morales-Santana. Id. , at 166–167. While the record before us reveals little\nabout Morales-Santana’s childhood, the Dominican archives disclose\nthat Yrma and José married in 1970, and that José was then added to\nMorales-Santana’s birth certificate as his father. Id. , at\n163–164, 167. José also related in the same affidavit that he was\nthen saving money “for the susten[ance] of [his] family” in\nanticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where members of\nhis family still resided. Id. , at 57. In 1975, when\nMorales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico, id. , at\n368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was attending public\nschool in the Bronx, a New York City borough, id. , at 140,\n369.[ 5 ] C In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana\nin removal proceedings based on several convictions for offenses\nunder New York State Penal Law, all of them rendered on May 17,\n1995. Id. , at 426. Morales-Santana ranked as an alien\ndespite the many years he lived in the United States, because, at\nthe time of his birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement\nof five years’ physical presence after age 14. See supra , at\n3–4, and n. 3. An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana’s\nclaim to citizenship derived from the U. S. citizenship of his\nfather, and ordered Morales-Santana’s removal to the Dominican\nRepublic. Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a–49a. In 2010,\nMorales-Santana moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the\nGovernment’s refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from\nhis U. S.-citizen father violated the Constitution’s equal\nprotection guarantee. See Record 27, 45. The Board of Immigration\nAppeals (BIA) denied the motion. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a,\n42a–44a. The United States Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit reversed the BIA’s decision. 804 F. 3d 520, 524\n(2015). Relying on this Court’s post-1970 construction of the equal\nprotection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications,\nthe court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed\nmothers and fathers. Id. , at 527–535. To cure the\nconstitutional flaw, the court further held that Morales-Santana\nderived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his\nmother the U. S. citizen. Id. , at 535–538. In so\nruling, the Second Circuit declined to follow the conflicting\ndecision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Flores-Villar , 536 F. 3d 990 (2008), see 804\nF. 3d, at 530, 535, n. 17. We granted certiorariin Flores-Villar , but ultimately affirmed by an equally divided\nCourt. Flores-Villar v. United States , 564 U. S.\n210 (2011) ( per curiam ). Taking up Morales-Santana’s\nrequest for review, 579 U. S. ___ (2016), we consider the\nmatter anew. II Because §1409 treats sons and daughters alike,\nMorales-Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender. He complains, instead, of gender-based\ndiscrimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of\nMorales-Santana’s birth and was not accorded the right an unwed\nU. S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her\nchild. Although the Government does not contend otherwise, we\nbriefly explain why Morales-Santana may seek to vindicate his\nfather’s right to the equal protection of the laws.[ 6 ] Ordinarily, a party “must assert his own legal\nrights” and “cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights\n. . . of third parties.” Warth v. Seldin ,\n422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975) . But we recognize an exception\nwhere, as here, “the party asserting the right has a close\nrelationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is\na hindrance to the possessor’s ability to protect his own\ninterests.” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U. S. 125,\n130 (2004) (quoting Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S.\n400, 411 (1991) ). José Morales’ ability to pass citizenship to his\nson, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies the “close\nrelationship” requirement. So, too, is the “hindrance” requirement\nwell met. José Morales’ failure to assert a claim in his own right\n“stems from disability,” not “disinterest,” Miller v. Albright , 523 U. S. 420, 450 (1998) (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring in judgment), for José died in 1976, Record 140, many\nyears before the current controversy arose. See Hodel v. Irving , 481 U. S. 704 –712, 723, n. 7 (1987)\n(children and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights of\ndeceased relatives). Morales-Santana is thus the “obvious\nclaimant,” see Craig v. Boren , 429 U. S. 190,\n197 (1976) , the “best available proponent,” Singleton v. Wulff , 428 U. S. 106, 116 (1976) , of his father’s\nright to equal protection. III Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an\nera when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad\ngeneralizations about the way men and women are. See, e.g. , Hoyt v. Florida , 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961) (women\nare the “center of home and family life,” therefore they can be\n“relieved from the civic duty of jury service”); Goesaert v. Cleary , 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (States may draw “a\nsharp line between the sexes”). Today, laws of this kind are\nsubject to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends\n“all gender-based classifications.” J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B. , 511 U. S. 127, 136 (1994) ; see, e.g. , United States v. Virginia , 518\nU. S. 515 –556 (1996) (state-maintained military academy may\nnot deny admission to qualified women). Laws granting or denying benefits “on the basis\nof the sex of the qualifying parent,” our post-1970 decisions\naffirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore attract\nheightened review under the Constitution’s equal protection\nguarantee. Califano v. Westcott , 443 U. S. 76,\n84 (1979) ; see id. , at 88–89 (holding unconstitutional\nprovision of unemployed-parent benefits exclusively to fathers).\nAccord Califano v. Goldfarb , 430 U. S. 199 –207\n(1977) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that denied widowers survivors’ benefits\navailable to widows); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld , 420\nU. S. 636 –653 (1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social\nSecurity classification that excluded fathers from receipt of\nchild-in-care benefits available to mothers); Frontiero v. Richardson , 411 U. S. 677 –691 (1973) (plurality\nopinion) (holding unconstitutional exclusion of married female\nofficers in the military from benefits automatically accorded\nmarried male officers); cf. Reed v. Reed , 404\nU. S. 71 –77 (1971) (holding unconstitutional a probate-code\npreference for a father over a mother as administrator of a\ndeceased child’s estate).[ 7 ] Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for\nfathers, §1409 is of the same genre as the classifications we\ndeclared unconstitutional in Reed , Frontiero , Wiesenfeld , Goldfarb , and Westcott . As in\nthose cases, heightened scrutiny is in order. Successful defense of\nlegislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have\nreiterated, requires an “exceedingly persuasive justification.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); Kirchberg v. Feenstra , 450 U. S. 455,\n461 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). A The defender of legislation that\ndifferentiates on the basis of gender must show “at least that the\n[challenged] classification serves important governmental\nobjectives and that the discriminatory means employed are\nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533 (quoting Mississippi\nUniv. for Women v. Hogan , 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982)\n; alteration in original); see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53, 60, 70 (2001) . Moreover, the\nclassification must substantially serve an important governmental\ninterest today , for “in interpreting the [e]qual\n[p]rotection [guarantee], [we have] recognized that new insights\nand societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality\n. . . that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015)\n(slip op., at 20). Here, the Government has supplied no\n“exceedingly persuasive justification,” Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted), for §1409(a)\nand (c)’s “gender-based” and “gender-biased” disparity, Westcott , 443 U. S., at 84 (internalquotation marks\nomitted). 1 History reveals what lurks behind §1409.\nEnacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54Stat.\n1139–1140, §1409 ended a century and a half of congressional\nsilence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed\nparents.[ 8 ] During this era,\ntwo once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our\nNation’s citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and\nadministrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife\nsubordinate; unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a\nnonmarital child. Under the once entrenched principle of male\ndominance in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.\n“[D]ominance [of] the husband,” this Court observed in 1915, “is an\nancient principle of our jurisprudence.” Mackenzie v. Hare , 239 U. S. 299, 311 (1915) .[ 9 ] See generally Brief for Professors of History\net al. as Amici Curiae 4–15. Through the early 20th\ncentury, a male citizen automatically conferred U. S.\ncitizenship on his alien wife. Act of Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, §2,\n10Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen , 7 Wall. 496, 498\n(1869) (the 1855 Act “confers the privileges of citizenship upon\nwomen married to citizens of the United States”); C. Bredbenner, A\nNationality of Her Own:Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship\n15–16, 20–21 (1998). A female citizen, however, was incapable of\nconferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was subject to\nexpatriation if she married an alien.[ 10 ] The family of a citizen or a lawfully admitted\npermanent resident enjoyed statutory exemptions from entry\nrequirements, but only if the citizen or resident was male. See, e.g. , Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, §37, 32Stat. 1221\n(wives and children entering the country to join permanent-resident\naliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases during\ntransit shall not be deported if the diseases were easily curable\nor did not present a danger to others); S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st\nCong., 2d Sess., 415–417 (1950) (wives exempt from literacy and\nquota requirements). And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born\nchild of a married couple gained U. S. citizenship only\nthrough the father.[ 11 ] For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition\nnever held sway. Instead, the mother was regarded as the child’s\nnatural and sole guardian. At common law, the mother, and only the\nmother, was “bound to maintain [a nonmarital child] as its natural\nguardian.” 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *215–*216 (8th\ned. 1854); see Nguyen , 533 U. S., at 91–92 (O’Connor,\nJ., dissenting). In line with that understanding, in the early 20th\ncentury, the State Department sometimes permitted unwed mothers to\npass citizenship to their children, despite the absence of any\nstatutory authority for the practice. See Hearings on H. R.\n6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization,\n76th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings);\n39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 397–398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291\n(1939). See also Collins, Illegitimate Borders: Jus\nSanguinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family,\nRace, and Nation, 123 Yale L. J. 2134, 2199–2205 (2014)\n(hereinafter Collins). In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the\nfather-controls assumption concerning married parents, but codified\nthe mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried parents.\nThe Roosevelt administration, which proposed §1409, explained:\n“[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child] stands in the place of the\nfather . . . [,] has a right tothe custody and control of\nsuch a child as against the putative father, and is bound to\nmaintain it as its natu-ral guardian.” 1940 Hearings 431 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion\nrenders §1409’s gender-based residency rules understandable.\nFearing that a foreign-born child could turn out “more alien than\nAmerican in character,” the administration believed that a citizen\nparent with lengthy ties to the United States would counteract the\ninfluence of the alien parent. Id. , at 426–427. Concern\nabout the attachment of foreign-born children to the United States\nexplains the treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to\nthe familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have scant\ncontact with, their nonmarital children. For unwed citizen mothers,\nhowever, there was no need for a prolonged residency prophylactic:\nThe alien father, who might transmit foreign ways, was\npresumptively out of the picture. See id. , at 431; Collins\n2203 (in “nearly uniform view” of U. S. officials, “almost\ninvariably,” the mother alone “concern[ed] herself with [a\nnonmarital] child” (internal quotation marks omitted)). 2 For close to a half century, as earlier\nobserved, see supra , at 7–8, this Court has viewed with\nsuspicion laws that rely on “overbroad generalizations about the\ndifferent talents, capacities, or preferences of males and\nfemales.” Virginia , 518 U. S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld , 420 U. S., at 643, 648. In particular, we\nhave recognized that if a “statutory objective is to exclude or\n‘protect’ members of one gender” in reliance on “fixed notions\nconcerning [that gender’s] roles and abilities,” the “objective\nitself is illegitimate.” Mississippi Univ. for Women , 458\nU. S., at 725. In accord with this eventual understanding, the\nCourt has held that no “important [governmental] interest” is\nserved by laws grounded, as §1409(a) and (c) are, in the\nobsolescing view that “unwed fathers [are] invariably less\nqualified and entitled than mothers” to take responsibility for\nnonmarital children. Caban v. Mohammed , 441\nU. S. 380, 382, 394 (1979) .[ 12 ] Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court\nhas come to comprehend, have a constraining impact, descriptive\nthough they may be of the way many people still order their\nlives.[ 13 ] Laws according or\ndenying benefits in reliance on “[s]tereotypes about women’s\ndomestic roles,” the Court has observed, may “creat[e] a\nself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that force[s] women to\ncontinue to assume the role of primary family caregiver.” Nevada\nDept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs , 538 U. S. 721,\n736 (2003) . Correspondingly, such laws may disserve men who\nexercise responsibility for raising their children. See ibid. In light of the equal protection jurisprudence this\nCourt has developed since 1971, see Virginia , 518\nU. S., at 531–534, §1409(a) and (c)’s discrete\nduration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers\nwho have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly\nanachronistic. B In urging this Court nevertheless to reject\nMorales-Santana’s equal protection plea, the Government cites three\ndecisions of this Court: Fiallo v. Bell , 430\nU. S. 787 (1977) ; Miller v. Albright , 523\nU. S. 420 ; and Nguyen v. INS , 533 U. S. 53\n. None controls this case. The 1952 Act provision at issue in Fiallo gave special immigration preferences to alien children of citizen\n(or lawful-permanent-resident) mothers, and to alien unwed mothers\nof citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children. 430 U. S.,\nat 788–789, and n. 1. Unwed fathers and their children,\nasserting their right to equal protection, sought the same\npreferences. Id. , at 791. Applying minimal scrutiny\n(rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on\nCongress’ “exceptionally broad power” to admit or exclude aliens. Id. , at 792, 794.[ 14 ]\nThis case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.\nMorales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a\nU. S. citizen. Examining a claim of that order, the Court has\nnot disclaimed, as it did in Fiallo , the application of an\nexacting standard of review. See Nguyen , 533 U. S., at\n60–61, 70; Miller , 523 U. S., at 434–435, n. ",

HARRIS et al. on appeal from the united states district\ncourt for the middle district of north carolina No. 15–1262. Argued December 5, 2016—Decided\nMay 22, 2017 The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment prevents a State, in the absence of “sufficient\njustification,” from “separating its citizens into different voting\ndistricts on the basis of race.” Bethune-Hill v. Virginia\nState Bd. of Elections , 580 U. S. ___, ___. When a voter sues\nstate officials for drawing such race-based lines, this Court’s\ndecisions call for a two-step analysis. First, the plaintiff must\nprove that “race was the predominant factor motivating the\nlegislature’s decision to place a significant number of voters\nwithin or without a particular district.” Miller v. Johnson , 515 U. S. 900 . Second, if racial\nconsiderations did predominate, the State must prove that its\nrace-based sorting of voters serves a “compelling interest” and is\n“narrowly tailored” to that end, Bethune-Hill , 580\nU. S., at ___. This Court has long assumed that one compelling\ninterest is compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA or\nAct). When a State invokes the VRA to justify race-based\ndistricting, it must show (to meet the “narrow tailoring”\nrequirement) that it had “good reasons” for concluding that the\nstatute required its action. Alabama Legislative Black\nCaucus v. Alabama , 575 U. S. ___, ___. A district\ncourt’s factual findings made in the course of this two-step\ninquiry are reviewed only for clear error. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\n52(a)(6); Easley v. Cromartie , 532 U. S. 234\n( Cromartie II ). This case concerns North Carolina’s redrawing\nof two congressional districts, District 1 and District 12, after\nthe 2010 census. Prior to that redistricting, neither district had\na majority black voting-age population (BVAP), but both\nconsistently elected the candidates preferred by most\nAfrican-American voters. The new map significantly altered both\nDistrict 1 and District 12. The State needed to add almost 100,000\npeople to District 1 to comply with the one-person-one-vote\nprinciple, and it chose to take most of those people from heavily\nblack areas of Durham—increasing the district’s BVAP from 48.6% to\n52.7%. The State also reconfigured District 12, increasing its BVAP\nfrom 43.8% to 50.7%. Registered voters in those districts (here\ncalled “the plaintiffs”) filed suit against North Carolina\nofficials (collectively, “the State” or “North Carolina”),\ncomplaining of impermissible racial gerrymanders. A three-judge\nDistrict Court held both districts unconstitutional. It found that\nracial considerations predominated in the drawing of District 1’s\nlines and rejected the State’s claim that this action was justified\nby the VRA. As for District 12, the court again found that race\npredominated, and it explained that the State made no attempt to\njustify its attention to race in designing that district. Held: 1. North Carolina’s victory in a similar\nstate-court lawsuit does not dictate the disposition of this case\nor alter the applicable standard of review. Before this case was\nfiled, a state trial court rejected a claim by several civil rights\ngroups that Districts 1 and 12 were unlawful racial gerrymanders.\nThe North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed that decision under the\nstate-court equivalent of clear error review. The State claims that\nthe plaintiffs are members of the same organizations that brought\nthe earlier case, and thus precluded from raising the same\nquestions anew. But the State never satisfied the District Court\nthat the alleged affiliation really existed. And because the\nDistrict Court’s factual finding was reasonable, it defeats North\nCarolina’s attempt to argue for claim or issue preclusion here. The State’s backup argument about the proper\nstandard of review also falls short. The rule that a trial court’s\nfactual findings are reviewed only for clear error contains no\nexception for findings that diverge from those made in another\ncourt. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6). Although the state\ncourt’s decision is certainly relevant, the premise of clear error\nreview is that there are often “two permissible views of the\nevidence.” Anderson v. Bessemer City , 470 U. S.\n564 . Even assuming that the state court’s findings capture one\nsuch view, the only question here is whether the District Court’s\nassessment represents another. Pp. 7–10. 2. The District Court did not err in\nconcluding that race furnished the predominant rationale for\nDistrict 1’s redesign and that the State’s interest in complying\nwith the VRA could not justify that consideration of race.\nPp. 10–18. (a) The record shows that the State\npurposefully established a racial target for the district and that\nthe target “had a direct and significant impact” on the district’s\nconfiguration, Alabama , 575 U. S., at ___, subordinating\nother districting criteria. Faced with this body of evidence, the\nDistrict Court did not clearly err in finding that race\npredominated in drawing District 1; indeed, it could hardly have\nconcluded anything but. Pp. 10–12. (b) North Carolina’s use of race as the\npredominant factor in designing District 1 does not withstand\nstrict scrutiny. The State argues that it had good reasons to\nbelieve that it had to draw a majority-minority district to avoid\nliability for vote dilution under §2 of the VRA. Thornburg v. Gingles , 478 U. S. 30 , identifies three threshold\nconditions for proving such a vote-dilution claim: (1) A “minority\ngroup” must be “sufficiently large and geographically compact to\nconstitute a majority” in some reasonably configured legislative\ndistrict, id., at 50; (2) the minority group must be\n“politically cohesive,” id., at 51; and (3) a district’s\nwhite majority must “vote[ ] sufficiently as a bloc” to\nusually “defeat the minority’s preferred candidate,” ibid .\nIf a State has good reason to think that all three of these\nconditions are met, then so too it has good reason to believe that\n§2 requires drawing a majority-minority district. But if not, then\nnot. Here, electoral history provided no evidence\nthat a §2 plaintiff could demonstrate the third Gingles prerequisite. For nearly 20 years before the new plan’s adoption,\nAfrican-Americans made up less than a majority of District 1’s\nvoters, but their preferred candidates scored consistent victories.\nDistrict 1 thus functioned as a “crossover” district, in which\nmembers of the majority help a “large enough” minority to elect its\ncandidate of choice. Bartlett v. Strickland , 556\nU. S. 1 (plurality opinion). So experience gave the State no\nreason to think that the VRA required it to ramp up District 1’s\nBVAP. The State counters that because it needed to\nsubstantially increase District 1’s population, the question facing\nthe state mapmakers was not whether the then-existing District 1 violated §2, but whether the future District 1\nwould do so if drawn without regard to race. But that reasoning,\ntaken alone, cannot justify the State’s race-based redesign of the\ndistrict. Most important, the State points to no meaningful\nlegislative inquiry into the key issue it identifies: whether a\nnew, enlarged District 1, created without a focus on race, could\nlead to §2 liability. To have a strong basis to conclude that §2\ndemands race-based measures to augment a district’s BVAP, the State\nmust evaluate whether a plaintiff could establish the Gingles preconditions in a new district created without\nthose measures. Nothing in the legislative record here fits that\ndescription. And that is no accident: The redistricters believed\nthat this Court’s decision in Strickland mandated a 50%-plus\nBVAP in District 1. They apparently reasoned that if, as Strickland held, §2 does not require crossover\ndistricts (for groups insufficiently large under Gingles ),\nthen §2 also cannot be satisfied by crossover districts (for\ngroups meeting Gingles ’ size condition). But, as this\nCourt’s §2 jurisprudence makes clear, unless each of the\nthree Gingles prerequisites is established, “there neither\nhas been a wrong nor can be a remedy.” Growe v. Emison , 507 U. S. 25 . North Carolina’s belief that it\nwas compelled to redraw District 1 (a successful crossover\ndistrict) as a majority-minority district thus rested on a pure\nerror of law. Accordingly, the Court upholds the District Court’s\nconclusion that the State’s use of race as the predominant factor\nin designing District 1 does not withstand strict scrutiny.\nPp. 12–18. 3. The District Court also did not\nclearly err by finding that race predominated in the redrawing of\nDistrict 12. Pp. 18–34. (a) The district’s legality turns solely\non which of two possible reasons predominantly explains its\nreconfiguration. The plaintiffs contended at trial that North\nCarolina intentionally increased District 12’s BVAP in the name of\nensuring preclearance under §5 of the VRA. According to the State,\nby contrast, the mapmakers moved voters in and out of the district\nas part of a “strictly” political gerrymander, without regard to\nrace. After hearing evidence supporting both parties’ accounts, the\nDistrict Court accepted the plaintiffs’. Getting to the bottom of a dispute like this\none poses special challenges for a trial court, which must make\n“ ‘a sensitive inquiry’ ” into all “ ‘circumstantial\nand direct evidence of intent’ ” to assess whether the\nplaintiffs have proved that race, not politics, drove a district’s\nlines. Hunt v. Cromartie , 526 U. S. 541\n( Cromartie I ). This Court’s job is different—and generally\neasier. It affirms a trial court’s factual finding as to racial\npredominance so long as the finding is “plausible”; it reverses\nonly when “left with the definite and firm conviction that a\nmistake has been committed.” Anderson, 470 U. S., at\n573–574. In assessing a finding’s plausibility, moreover, the Court\ngives singular deference to a trial court’s judgments about the\ncredibility of witnesses. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6).\nApplying those principles here, the evidence at trial—including\nlive witness testimony subject to credibility\ndeterminations—adequately supports the District Court’s conclusion\nthat race, not politics, accounted for District 12’s\nreconfiguration. And contrary to the State’s view, the court had no\ncall to dismiss this challenge just because the plaintiffs did not\nproffer an alternative design for District 12. Pp. 18–21. (b) By slimming the district and adding a\ncouple of knobs to its snakelike body, North Carolina added 35,000\nAfrican-Americans and subtracted 50,000 whites, turning District 12\ninto a majority-minority district. State Senator Robert Rucho and\nState Representative David Lewis—the chairs of the two committees\nresponsible for preparing the revamped plan—publicly stated that\nracial considerations lay behind District 12’s augmented BVAP.\nSpecifically, Rucho and Lewis explained that because part of\nGuilford County, a jurisdiction covered by §5 of the VRA, lay in\nthe district, they had increased the district’s BVAP to ensure\npreclearance of the plan. Dr. Thomas Hofeller, their hired\nmapmaker, confirmed that intent. The State’s preclearance\nsubmission to the Justice Department indicated a similar\ndetermination to concentrate black voters in District 12. And, in\ntestimony that the District Court found credible, Congressman Mel\nWatt testified that Rucho disclosed a majority-minority target to\nhim in 2011. Hofeller testified that he had drawn District 12’s\nlines based on political data, and that he checked the racial data\nonly after he drew a politics-based line between adjacent\nareas in Guilford County. But the District Court disbelieved\nHofeller’s asserted indifference to the new district’s racial\ncomposition, pointing to his contrary deposition testimony and a\nsignificant contradiction in his trial testimony. Finally, an\nexpert report lent circumstantial support to the plaintiffs’ case,\nshowing that, regardless of party, a black voter in the region was\nthree to four times more likely than a white voter to cast a ballot\nwithin District 12’s borders. The District Court’s assessment that all this\nevidence proved racial predominance clears the bar of clear error\nreview. Maybe this Court would have evaluated the testimony\ndifferently had it presided over the trial; or then again, maybe it\nwould not have. Either way, the Court is far from having a\n“definite and firm conviction” that the District Court made a\nmistake in concluding from the record before it that racial\nconsiderations predominated in District 12’s design . Pp. 21–28. (c) Finally, North Carolina argues that\nwhen race and politics are competing explanations of a district’s\nlines, plaintiffs must introduce an alternative map that achieves a\nState’s asserted political goals while improving racial balance.\nSuch a map can serve as key evidence in a race-versus-politics\ndispute, but it is hardly the only means to disprove a\nState’s contention that politics drove a district’s lines. In this\ncase, the plaintiffs’ introduction of mostly direct and some\ncircumstantial evidence gave the District Court a sufficient basis,\nsans any map, to resolve the race-or-politics question. Although a\nplaintiff will sometimes need an alternative map, as a practical\nmatter, to make his case, such a map is merely an evidentiary tool\nto show that an equal protection violation has occurred; neither\nits presence nor its absence can itself resolve a racial\ngerrymandering claim. North Carolina claims that a passage of this\nCourt’s opinion in Cromartie II makes an alternative map\nessential in cases like this one, but the reasoning of Cromartie\nII belies that reading. The Court’s opinion nowhere attempts to\nexplicate or justify the categorical rule that the State claims to\nfind there, and the entire thrust of the opinion runs counter to an\ninflexible counter-map requirement. Rightly understood, the passage\non which the State relies had a different and narrower point: Given\nthe weak evidence of a racial gerrymander offered in Cromartie\nII , only maps that would actually show what the\nplaintiffs’ had not could carry the day. This case, in contrast,\nturned not on the possibility of creating more optimally\nconstructed districts, but on direct evidence of the General\nAssembly’s intent in creating the actual District 12—including many\nhours of trial testimony subject to credibility determinations.\nThat evidence, the District Court plausibly found, itself satisfied\nthe plaintiffs’ burden of debunking North Carolina’s politics\ndefense. Pp. 28–34. 159 F. Supp. 3d 600, affirmed. Kagan, J., delivered the opinion of the Court,\nin which Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.\nThomas, J., filed a concurring opinion. Alito, J., filed an opinion\nconcurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part, in which\nRoberts, C. J., and Kennedy, J., joined. Gorsuch, J., took no\npart in the consideration or decision of the case.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1262 _________________ ROY COOPER, GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA,\net al., APPELLANTS v. DAVID HARRIS, et al. on appeal from the united states district\ncourt for the middle district of north carolina [May 22, 2017] Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. The Constitution entrusts States with the job of\ndesigning congressional districts. But it also imposes an important\nconstraint: A State may not use race as the predominant factor in\ndrawing district lines unless it has a compelling reason. In this\ncase, a three-judge District Court ruled that North Carolina\nofficials violated that bar when they created two districts whose\nvoting-age populations were majority black. Applying a deferential\nstandard of review to the factual findings underlying thatdecision,\nwe affirm. I A The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment limits racial gerrymanders in legislative districting\nplans. It prevents a State, in the absence of “sufficient\njustification,” from “separating its citizens into different voting\ndistricts on the basis of race.” Bethune-Hill v. Virginia\nState Bd. of Elections , 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip\nop., at 6) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). When\na voter sues state officials for drawing such race-based lines, our\ndecisions call for a two-step analysis. First, the plaintiff must prove that “race was\nthe predominant factor motivating the legislature’s decision to\nplace a significant number of voters within or without a particular\ndistrict.” Miller v. Johnson , 515 U. S. 900, 916\n(1995) . That entails demonstrating that the legislature\n“subordinated” other factors—compactness, respect for political\nsubdivisions, partisan advantage, what have you—to “racial\nconsiderations.” Ibid. The plaintiff may make the required\nshowing through “direct evidence” of legislative intent,\n“circumstantial evidence of a district’s shape and demographics,”\nor a mix of both. Ibid. [ 1 ] Second, if racial considerations predominated\nover others, the design of the district must withstand strict\nscrutiny. See Bethune-Hill , 580 U. S., at ____ (slip op., at\n13). The burden thus shifts to the State to prove that its\nrace-based sorting of voters serves a “compelling interest” and is\n“narrowly tailored” to that end. Ibid . This Court has long\nassumed that one compelling interest is complying with operative\nprovisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA or Act), 79Stat.\n437, as amended, 52 U. S. C. §10301 et seq . See, e.g., Shaw v. Hunt , 517 U. S. 899, 915\n(1996) ( Shaw II ). Two provisions of the VRA—§2 and §5—are involved\nin this case. §§10301, 10304. Section 2 prohibits any “standard,\npractice, or procedure” that “results in a denial or abridgement of\nthe right . . . to vote on account of race.” §10301(a).\nWe have construed that ban to extend to “vote dilution”—brought\nabout, most relevantly here, by the “dispersal of [a group’s\nmembers] into districts in which they constitute an ineffective\nminority of voters.” Thornburg v. Gingles , 478 U. S.\n30 , n. 11 (1986). Section 5, at the time of the districting\nin dispute, worked through a different mechanism. Before this Court\ninvalidated its coverage formula, see Shelby County v. Holder , 570 U. S. __ (2013), that section required certain\njurisdictions (including various North Carolina counties) to\npre-clear voting changes with the Department of Justice, so as to\nforestall “retrogression” in the ability of racial minorities to\nelect their preferred candidates, Beer v. United\nStates , 425 U. S. 130, 141 (1976) . When a State invokes the VRA to justify\nrace-based districting, it must show (to meet the “narrow\ntailoring” requirement) that it had “a strong basis in evidence”\nfor concluding that the statute required its action. Alabama\nLegislative Black Caucus v. Alabama , 575 U. S. ___,\n___ (2015) (slip op., at 22). Or said otherwise, the State must\nestablish that it had “good reasons” to think that it would\ntransgress the Act if it did not draw race-based district\nlines. Ibid . That “strong basis” (or “good reasons”)\nstandard gives States “breathing room” to adopt reasonable\ncompliance measures that may prove, in perfect hindsight, not to\nhave been needed. Bethune-Hill , 580 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 16). A district court’s assessment of a districting\nplan, in accordance with the two-step inquiry just described,\nwarrants significant deference on appeal to this Court.[ 2 ] We of course retain full power to\ncorrect a court’s errors of law, at either stage of the analysis.\nBut the court’s findings of fact—most notably, as to whether racial\nconsiderations predominated in drawing district lines—are subject\nto review only for clear error. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6); Easley v. Cromartie , 532 U. S. 234, 242 (2001)\n( Cromartie II ); id., at 259 (Thomas, J., dissenting).\nUnder that standard, we may not reverse just because we “would have\ndecided the [matter] differently.” Anderson v. Bessemer\nCity , 470 U. S. 564, 573 (1985) . A finding that is\n“plausible” in light of the full record—even if another is equally\nor more so—must govern. Id., at 574. B This case concerns North Carolina’s most\nrecent redrawing of two congressional districts, both of which have\nlong included substantial populations of black voters. In its\ncurrent incarnation, District 1 is anchored in the northeastern\npart of the State, with appendages stretching both south and west\n(the latter into Durham). District 12 begins in the south-central\npart of the State (where it takes in a large part of Charlotte) and\nthen travels northeast, zig-zagging much of the way to the State’s\nnorthern border. (Maps showing the districts are included in an\nappendix to this opinion.) Both have quite the history before this\nCourt. We first encountered the two districts, in their\n1992 versions, in Shaw v. Reno , 509 U. S. 630\n(1993) . There, we held that voters stated an equal protection\nclaim by alleging that Districts 1 and 12 were unwarranted racial\ngerrymanders. See id. , at 642, 649. After a remand to the\nDistrict Court, the case arrived back at our door. See Shaw\nII , 517 U. S. 899 . That time, we dismissed the challenge\nto District 1 for lack of standing, but struck down District 12.\nThe design of that “serpentine” district, we held, was nothing if\nnot race-centric, and could not be justified as a reasonable\nattempt to comply with the VRA. Id., at 906; see id., at 911–918. The next year, the State responded with a new\ndistricting plan, including a new District 12—and residents of that\ndistrict brought another lawsuit alleging an impermissible racial\ngerrymander. A District Court sustained the claim twice, but both\ntimes this Court reversed. See Hunt v. Cromartie , 526\nU. S. 541 (1999) ( Cromartie I ); Cromartie II ,\n532 U. S. 234 . Racial considerations, we held, did not predominate\nin designing the revised District 12. Rather, that district was the\nresult of a political gerrymander—an effort to engineer,\nmostly “without regard to race,” a safe Democratic seat. Id. , at 245. The State redrew its congressional districts\nagain in 2001, to account for population changes revealed in the\nprior year’s census. Under the 2001 map, which went unchallenged in\ncourt, neither District 1 nor District 12 had a black voting-age\npopulation (called a “BVAP”) that was a majority of the whole: The\nformer had a BVAP of around 48%, the latter a BVAP of around 43%.\nSee App. 312, 503. Nonetheless, in five successive general\nelections conducted in those reconfigured districts, all the\ncandidates preferred by most African-American voters won their\ncontests—and by some handy margins. In District 1, black voters’\ncandidates of choice garnered as much as 70% of the total vote, and\nnever less than 59%. See 5 Record 636, 638, 641, 645, 647 (Pls.\nExh. 112). And in District 12, those candidates won with 72% of the\nvote at the high end and 64% at the low. See id., at 637,\n640, 643, 646, 650. Another census, in 2010, necessitated yet\nanother congressional map—(finally) the one at issue in this case.\nState Senator Robert Rucho and State Representative David Lewis,\nboth Republicans, chaired the two committees jointly responsible\nfor preparing the revamped plan. They hired Dr. Thomas Hofeller, a\nveteran political mapmaker, to assist them in redrawing district\nlines. Several hearings, drafts, and revisions later, both chambers\nof the State’s General Assembly adopted the scheme the three men\nproposed. The new map (among other things) significantly\naltered both District 1 and District 12. The 2010 census had\nrevealed District 1 to be substantially underpopulated: To comply\nwith the Constitution’s one-person-one-vote principle, the State\nneeded to place almost 100,000 new people within the district’s\nboundaries. See App. 2690; Evenwel v. Abbott , 578\nU. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 3) (explaining that\n“[s]tates must draw congressional districts with populations as\nclose to perfect equality as possible”). Rucho, Lewis, and Hofeller\nchose to take most of those people from heavily black areas of\nDurham, requiring a finger-like extension of the district’s western\nline. See Appendix, infra . With that addition, District 1’s\nBVAP rose from 48.6% to 52.7%. See App. 312–313. District 12, for\nits part, had no need for significant total-population changes: It\nwas overpopulated by fewer than 3,000 people out of over 730,000.\nSee id ., at 1150. Still, Rucho, Lewis, and Hofeller decided\nto reconfigure the district, further narrowing its already\nsnakelike body while adding areas at either end—most relevantly\nhere, in Guilford County. See Appendix, infra ; App. 1164.\nThose changes appreciably shifted the racial composition of\nDistrict 12: As the district gained some 35,000 African-Americans\nof voting age and lost some 50,000 whites of that age, its BVAP\nincreased from 43.8% to 50.7%. See 2 Record 349 (Fourth Affidavit\nof Dan Frey, Exh. 5); id., at 416 (Exh. 11). Registered voters in the two districts (David\nHarris and Christine Bowser, here called “the plaintiffs”) brought\nthis suit against North Carolina officials (collectively, “the\nState” or “North Carolina”), complaining of impermissible racial\ngerrymanders. After a bench trial, a three-judge District Court\nheld both districts unconstitutional. All the judges agreed that\nracial considerations predominated in the design of District 1. See Harris v. McCrory , 159 F. Supp. 3d 600, 611\n(MDNC 2016). And in then applying strict scrutiny, all rejected the\nState’s argument that it had a “strong basis” for thinking that the\nVRA compelled such a race-based drawing of District 1’s lines. Id., at 623. As for District 12, a majority of the panel\nheld that “race predominated” over all other factors, including\npartisanship. Id. , at 622. And the court explained that the\nState had failed to put forward any reason, compelling or\notherwise, for its attention to race in designing that district.\nSee ibid. Judge Osteen dissented from the conclusion that\nrace, rather than politics, drove District 12’s lines—yet still\ncharacterized the majority’s view as “[e]minently reasonable.” Id. , at 640. The State filed a notice of appeal, and we noted\nprobable jurisdiction. McCrory v. Harris , 579\nU. S. ___ (2016). II We address at the outset North Carolina’s\ncontention that a victory it won in a very similar state-court\nlawsuit should dictate (or at least influence) our disposition of\nthis case. As the State explains, the North Carolina NAACP and\nseveral other civil rights groups challenged Districts 1 and 12 in\nstate court immediately after their enactment, charging that they\nwere unlawful racial gerrymanders. See Brief for Appellants 19–20.\nBy the time the plaintiffs before us filed this action, the state\ntrial court, in Dickson v. Rucho , had rejected those\nclaims—finding that in District 1 the VRA justified the General\nAssembly’s use of race and that in District 12 race was not a\nfactor at all. See App. 1969. The North Carolina Supreme Court then\naffirmed that decision by a 4–3 vote, applying the state-court\nequivalent of clear error review. See Dickson v. Rucho , 368 N. C. 481, 500, 781 S. E. 2d 404, 419\n(2015), modified on denial of reh’g, 368 N. C. 673, 789\nS. E. 2d 436 (2016), cert. pending, No. 16–24. In this Court,\nNorth Carolina makes two related arguments based on the Dickson litigation: first, that the state trial court’s\njudgment should have barred this case altogether, under familiar\nprinciples of claim and issue preclusion; and second, that the\nstate court’s conclusions should cause us to conduct a “searching\nreview” of the decision below, rather than deferring (as usual) to\nits factual findings. Reply Brief 6. The State’s preclusion theory rests on an\nassertion about how the plaintiffs in the two cases are affiliated.\nAs the State acknowledges, one person’s lawsuit generally does not\nbar another’s, no matter how similar they are in substance. See Taylor v. Sturgell , 553 U. S. 880 –893 (2008) (noting\nthe “deep-rooted historic tradition that everyone should have his\nown day in court”). But when plaintiffs in two cases have a special\nrelationship, a judgment against one can indeed bind both. See id., at 893–895 (describing six categories of qualifying\nrelationships). The State contends that Harris and Bowser, the\nplaintiffs here, are members of organizations that were plaintiffs\nin Dickson . And according to North Carolina, that connection\nprevents the pair from raising anew the questions that the state\ncourt previously resolved against those groups. See Brief for\nAppellants 20–21. But North Carolina never satisfied the District\nCourt that the alleged affiliation really existed. When the State\nargued that its preclusion theory entitled it to summary judgment,\nHarris and Bowser responded that they were not members of any of\nthe organizations that had brought the Dickson suit. See 3\nRecord 1577–1582 (Defs. Motion for Summary Judgment); 4 Record\n101–106 (Pls. Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment). The\nparties’ dueling contentions turned on intricate issues about those\ngroups’ membership policies ( e.g., could Harris’s payment of\ndues to the national NAACP, or Bowser’s financial contribution to\nthe Mecklenburg County NAACP, have made either a member of the\nstate branch?). Because of those unresolved “factual disputes,” the\nDistrict Court denied North Carolina’s motion for summary judgment.\n4 Record 238 (July 29, 2014 Order). And nothing in the subsequent\ntrial supported the State’s assertion about Harris’s and Bowser’s\norganizational ties: Indeed, the State chose not to present any\nfurther evidence relating to the membership issue. Based on the\nresulting record, the District Court summarily rejected the State’s\nclaim that Harris and Bowser were something other than independent\nplaintiffs. See 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 609. That conclusion defeats North Carolina’s attempt\nto argue for claim or issue preclusion here. We have no basis for\nassessing the factual assertions underlying the State’s argument\nany differently than the District Court did. Nothing in the State’s\nevidence clearly rebuts Harris’s and Bowser’s testimony that they\nnever joined any of the Dickson groups. We need not decide\nwhether the alleged memberships would have supported preclusion if\nthey had been proved. It is enough that the District Court\nreason-ably thought they had not. The State’s back-up argument about our standard\nof review also falls short. The rule that we review a trial court’s\nfactual findings for clear error contains no exception for findings\nthat diverge from those made in another court. See Fed. Rule Civ.\nProc. 52(a)(6) (“Findings of fact . . . must not be set\naside unless clearly erroneous”); see also Hernandez v. New York , 500 U. S. 352, 369 (1991) (plurality opinion)\n(applying the same standard to a state court’s findings). Whatever\nfindings are under review receive the benefit of deference, without\nregard to whether a court in a separate suit has seen the matter\ndifferently. So here, we must ask not which court considering\nDistricts 1 and 12 had the better view of the facts, but simply\nwhether the court below’s view is clearly wrong. That does not mean\nthe state court’s decision is wholly irrelevant: It is common sense\nthat, all else equal, a finding is more likely to be plainly wrong\nif some judges disagree with it. Cf. Glossip v. Gross , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 17)\n(noting that we are even less likely to disturb a factual\ndetermination when “multiple trial courts have reached the same\nfinding”). But the very premise of clear error review is that there\nare often “two permissible”—because two “plausible”—“views of the\nevidence.” Anderson , 470 U. S., at 574; see supra, at 4. Even assuming the state court’s findings\ncapture one such view, the District Court’s assessment may yet\nrepresent another. And the permissibility of the District Court’s\naccount is the only question before us. III With that out of the way, we turn to the\nmerits of this case, beginning (appropriately enough) with District\n1. As noted above, the court below found that race furnished the\npredominant rationale for that district’s redesign. See supra, at 6–7. And it held that the State’s interest in\ncomplying with the VRA could not justify that consideration of\nrace. See supra, at 7 . We uphold both\nconclusions. A Uncontested evidence in the record shows that\nthe State’s mapma",

The FHA prohibits, among other things,\nracial discrimination in connection with real-estate transactions,\n42 U. S. C. §§3604(b), 3605(a), and permits any\n“aggrieved person” to file a civil damages action for a violation\nof the Act, §§3613(a)(1)(A), (c)(1). The City’s complaints charge\nthat the Banks intentionally targeted predatory practices at\nAfrican-American and Latino neighborhoods and residents, lending to\nminority borrowers on worse terms than equally creditworthy\nnonminority borrowers and inducing defaults by failing to extend\nrefinancing and loan modifications to minority borrowers on fair\nterms. The City alleges that the Banks’ discriminatory conduct led\nto a disproportionate number of foreclosures and vacancies in\nmajority-minority neighborhoods, which impaired the City’s effort\nto assure racial integration, diminished the City’s property-tax\nrevenue, and increased demand for police, fire, and other municipal\nservices. The District Court dismissed the complaints on the\ngrounds that (1) the harms alleged fell outside the zone of\ninterests the FHA protects and (2) the complaints failed to show a\nsufficient causal connection between the City’s injuries and the\nBanks’ discriminatory conduct. The Eleventh Circuit reversed. Held : 1. The City is an “aggrieved person”\nauthorized to bring suit under the FHA. In addition to satisfying\nconstitutional standing requirements, see Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins , 578 U. S. ___, ___, a plaintiff must show that\nthe statute grants the plaintiff the cause of action he or she\nasserts. It is presumed that a statute ordinarily provides a cause\nof action “only to plaintiffs whose interests ‘fall within the zone\nof interests protected by the law invoked.’ ” Lexmark\nInt’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc. , 572\nU. S. ___, ___. The City’s claims of financial injury are, at\nthe least, “arguably within the zone of interests” the FHA\nprotects. Association of Data Processing Service Organizations,\nInc. v. Camp , 397 U. S. 150 . The FHA defines an\n“aggrieved person” as “any person who” either “claims to have been\ninjured by a discriminatory housing practice” or believes that such\nan injury “is about to occur,” 8 U. S. C. §3602(i). This\nCourt has said that the definition of “person aggrieved” in the\noriginal version of the FHA “showed ‘a congressional intention to\ndefine standing as broadly as is permitted by Article III of the\nConstitution,’ ” Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life\nIns. Co. , 409 U. S. 205 ; and has held that the Act\npermits suit by parties similarly situated to the City, see, e.g., Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood , 441\nU. S. 91 (village alleging that it lost tax revenue and had\nthe racial balance of its community undermined by racial-steering\npractices). Against the backdrop of those decisions, Congress did\nnot materially alter the definition of person “aggrieved” when it\nreenacted the current version of the Act. The Banks nonetheless contend that the\ndefinition sets boundaries that fall short of those the\nConstitution sets. Even assuming that some form of their argument\nis valid, this Court concludes that the City’s financial injuries\nfall within the zone of interests that the FHA protects. The City’s\nclaims are similar in kind to those of the Village of Bellwood,\nwhich the Court held in Gladstone , supra , could bring\nsuit under the FHA. The Court explained that the defendants’\ndiscriminatory conduct adversely affected the village by, among\nother things, producing a “significant reduction in property values\n[that] directly injures a municipality by diminishing its tax base,\nthus threatening its ability to bear the costs of local government\nand to provide services.” Id., at 110–111. The City’s\nalleged economic injuries thus arguably fall within the FHA’s zone\nof interests, as this Court has previously interpreted that\nstatute. Stare decisis principles compel the Court’s\nadherence to those precedents, and principles of statutory\ninterpretation demand that the Court respect Congress’ decision to\nratify those precedents when it reenacted the relevant statutory\ntext. Pp. 5–9. 2. The Eleventh Circuit erred in\nconcluding that the complaints met the FHA’s proximate-cause\nrequirement based solely on the finding that the City’s alleged\nfinancial injuries were foreseeable results of the Banks’\nmisconduct. A claim for damages under the FHA is akin to a “tort\naction,” Meyer v. Holley , 537 U. S. 280 , and is\nthus subject to the common-law requirement that loss is\nattributable “ ‘to the proximate cause, and not to any remote\ncause,’ ” Lexmark , 572 U. S., at ___. The\nproximate-cause analysis asks “whether the harm alleged has a\nsufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute\nprohibits.” Id., at ___. With respect to the FHA,\nforeseeability alone does not ensure the required close connection.\nNothing in the statute suggests that Congress intended to provide a\nremedy for any foreseeable result of an FHA violation, which may\n“ ‘cause ripples of harm to flow’ ” far beyond the\ndefendant’s misconduct, Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal.,\nInc. v. Carpenters , 459 U. S. 519 ; and doing so\nwould risk “massive and complex damages litigation,” id., at\n545. Rather, proximate cause under the FHA requires “some direct\nrelation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct\nalleged.” Holmes v. Securities Investors Protection\nCorporation , 503 U. S. 258 . The Court has repeatedly\napplied directness principles to statutes with “common-law\nfoundations.” Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp. , 547\nU. S. 451 . “ ‘The general tendency’ ” in these\ncases, “ ‘in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond\nthe first step.’ ” Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New\nYork , 559 U. S. 1 . What falls within that step depends in\npart on the “nature of the statutory cause of action,” Lexmark , supra , at ___, and an assessment “ ‘of\nwhat is administratively possible and convenient,’ ” Holmes , supra , at 268. The Court declines to draw the precise\nboundaries of proximate cause under the FHA, particularly where\nneither the Eleventh Circuit nor other courts of appeals have\nweighed in on the issue. Instead, the lower courts should define,\nin the first instance, the contours of proximate cause under the\nFHA and decide how that standard applies to the City’s claims for\nlost property-tax revenue and increased municipal expenses.\nPp. 10–12. No. 15–1111, 800 F. 3d 1262, and No.\n15–1112, 801 F. 3d 1258, vacated and remanded. Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and\nKagan, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed an opinion concurring in part\nand dissenting in part, in which Kennedy and Alito, JJ., joined.\nGorsuch, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the\ncases. Notes 1 Together with No. 15–1112, Wells Fargo & Co . et al . v. City of\nMiami, Florida, also on certiorari to the same\ncourt.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ Nos. 15–1111 and 15–1112 _________________ BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION,\net al., PETITIONERS 15–1111 v. CITY OF MIAMI, FLORIDA WELLS FARGO & CO., et al.,\nPETITIONERS 15–1112 v. CITY OF MIAMI, FLORIDA on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eleventh circuit [May 1, 2017] Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. The Fair Housing Act (FHA or Act) forbids “discriminat[ing] against any person in\nthe terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a\ndwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in\nconnection therewith, because of race . . . .” 42\nU. S. C. §3604(b). It further makes it unlawful for “any person or other entity whose business\nincludes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions\nto discriminate against any person in making available such a\ntransaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction,\nbecause of race . . . .” §3605(a). The statute allows any “aggrieved person” to\nfile a civil action seeking damages for a violation of the statute.\n§§3613(a)(1)(A), 3613(c)(1). And it defines an “aggrieved person”\nto include “any person who . . . claims to have been\ninjured by a discriminatory housing practice.” §3602(i). The City of Miami claims that two banks, Bank of\nAmerica and Wells Fargo, intentionally issued riskier mortgages on\nless favorable terms to African-American and Latino customers than\nthey issued to similarly situated white, non-Latino customers, in\nviolation of §§3604(b) and 3605(a). App. 185–197, 244–245, 350–362,\n428. The City, in amended complaints, alleges that these\ndiscriminatory practices have (1) “adversely impacted the racial\ncomposition of the City,” id., at 232, 416; (2) “impaired\nthe City’s goals to assure racial integration and desegregation,” ibid. ; (3) “frustrate[d] the City’s longstanding and active\ninterest in promoting fair housing and securing the benefits of an\nintegrated community,” id., at 232–233, 416–417; and (4)\ndisproportionately “cause[d] foreclosures and vacancies in minority\ncommunities in Miami,” id., at 229, 413. Those foreclosures\nand vacancies have harmed the City by decreasing “the property\nvalue of the foreclosed home as well as the values of other homes\nin the neighborhood,” thereby (a) “reduc[ing] property tax revenues\nto the City,” id., at 234, 418, and (b) forcing the City to\nspend more on “municipal services that it provided and still must\nprovide to remedy blight and unsafe and dangerous conditions which\nexist at properties that were foreclosed as a result of [the\nBanks’] illegal lending practices,” id., at 233–234, 417.\nThe City claims that those practices violate the FHA and that it is\nentitled to damages for the listed injuries. The Banks respond that the complaints do not set\nforth a cause of action for two basic reasons. First, they contend\nthat the City’s claimed harms do not “arguably” fall within the\n“zone of interests” that the statute seeks to protect, Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp , 397 U. S. 150, 153 (1970) ; hence, the City is\nnot an “aggrieved person” entitled to sue under the Act, §3602(i).\nSecond, they say that the complaint fails to draw a\n“proximate-cause” connection between the violation claimed and the\nharm allegedly suffered. In their view, even if the City proves the\nviolations it charges, the distance between those violations and\nthe harms the City claims to have suffered is simply too great to\nentitle the City to collect damages. We hold that the City’s claimed injuries fall\nwithin the zone of interests that the FHA arguably protects. Hence,\nthe City is an “aggrieved person” able to bring suit under the\nstatute. We also hold that, to establish proximate cause under the\nFHA, a plaintiff must do more than show that its injuries\nforeseeably flowed from the alleged statutory violation. The lower\ncourt decided these cases on the theory that foreseeability is all\nthat the statute requires, so we vacate and remand for further\nproceedings. I In 2013, the City of Miami brought lawsuits in\nfederal court against two banks, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.\nThe City’s complaints charge that the Banks discriminatorily\nimposed more onerous, and indeed “preda-tory,” conditions on loans\nmade to minority borrowers than to similarly situated nonminority\nborrowers. App. 185–197, 350–362. Those “predatory” practices\nincluded, among others, excessively high interest rates,\nunjustified fees, teaser low-rate loans that overstated refinancing\nopportunities, large prepayment penalties, and—when default\nloomed—unjustified refusals to refinance or modify the loans. Id., at 225, 402. Due to the discriminatory nature of the\nBanks’ practices, default and foreclosure rates among minority\nborrowers were higher than among otherwise similar white borrowers\nand were concentrated in minority neighborhoods. Id., at\n225–232, 408–415. Higher foreclosure rates lowered property values\nand diminished property-tax revenue. Id., at 234, 418.\nHigher foreclosure rates—especially when accompanied by\nvacancies—also increased demand for municipal services, such as\npolice, fire, and building and code enforcement services, all\nneeded “to remedy blight and unsafe and dangerous conditions” that\nthe foreclosures and vacancies generate. Id., at 238–240,\n421–423. The complaints describe statistical analyses that trace\nthe City’s financial losses to the Banks’ discriminatory practices. Id., at 235–237; 419–420. The District Court dismissed the complaints on\nthe grounds that (1) the harms alleged, being economic and not\ndiscriminatory, fell outside the zone of interests the FHA\nprotects; (2) the complaints fail to show a sufficient causal\nconnection between the City’s injuries and the Banks’\ndiscriminatory conduct; and (3) the complaints fail to allege\nunlawful activity occurring within the Act’s 2-year statute of\nlimitations. The City then filed amended complaints (the complaints\nnow before us) and sought reconsideration. The District Court held\nthat the amended complaints could solve only the statute of\nlimitations problem. It consequently declined to reconsider the\ndismissals. The Court of Appeals reversed the District\nCourt. 800 F. 3d 1262 (CA11 2015); 801 F. 3d 1258 (CA11\n2015). It held that the City’s injuries fall within the “zone of\ninterests,” Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control\nComponents, Inc. , 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at\n10), that the FHA protects. 800 F. 3d, at 1274–1275, 1277\n(relying on Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins.\nCo. , 409 U. S. 205 (1972) ; Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood , 441 U. S. 91 (1979) ; and Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman , 455 U. S. 363\n(1982) ); 801 F. 3d, at 1266–1267 (similar). It added that the\ncomplaints adequately allege proximate cause. 800 F. 3d, at\n1278; 801 F. 3d, at 1267. And it remanded the cases while\nordering the District Court to accept the City’s complaints as\namended. 800 F. 3d, at 1286; 801 F. 3d, at 1267. The Banks filed petitions for certiorari, asking\nus to decide whether, as the Court of Appeals had in effect held,\nthe amended complaints satisfied the FHA’s zone-of-interests and\nproximate-cause requirements. We agreed to do so. II To satisfy the Constitution’s restriction of\nthis Court’s jurisdiction to “Cases” and “Controversies,”\nArt. III, §2, a plaintiff must demonstrate constitutional\nstanding. To do so, the plaintiff must show an “injury in fact”\nthat is “fairly traceable” to the defendant’s conduct and “that is\nlikely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins , 578 U. S. ___, ___\n(2016) (slip op., at 6) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of\nWildlife , 504 U. S. 555 –561 (1992)). This Court has also\nreferred to a plaintiff’s need to satisfy “prudential” or\n“statutory” standing requirements. See Lexmark, 572\nU. S., at ___–___, and n. 4 (slip op., at 6–9, and\nn. 4). In Lexmark , we said that the label\n“ ‘prudential standing’ ” was misleading, for the\nrequirement at issue is in reality tied to a particular statute. Ibid. The question is whether the statute grants the\nplaintiff the cause of action that he asserts. In answering that\nquestion, we presume that a statute ordinarily provides a cause of\naction “only to plaintiffs whose interests fall within the zone of\ninterests protected by the law invoked.” Id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have added that\n“[w]hether a plaintiff comes within ‘the zone of interests’ is an\nissue that requires us to determine, using traditional tools of\nstatutory interpretation, whether a legislatively conferred cause\nof action encompasses a particular plaintiff’s claim.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (some internal quotation marks\nomitted). Here, we conclude that the City’s claims of\nfinancial injury in their amended complaints—specifically, lost tax\nrevenue and extra municipal expenses—satisfy the “cause-of-action”\n(or “prudential standing”) requirement. To use the language of Data Processing , the City’s claims of in-jury it suffered as\na result of the statutory violations are, at the least,\n“ arguably within the zone of interests” that the FHA\nprotects. 397 U. S., at 153 (emphasis added). The FHA permits any “aggrieved person” to bring\na housing-discrimination lawsuit. 42 U. S. C. §3613(a).\nThe statute defines “aggrieved person” as “any person who” either\n“claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice”\nor believes that such an injury “is about to occur.” §3602(i). This Court has repeatedly written that the FHA’s\ndefinition of person “aggrieved” reflects a congressional intent to\nconfer standing broadly. We have said that the definition of\n“person aggrieved” in the original version of the FHA, §810(a),\n82Stat. 85, “showed ‘a congressional intention to define standing\nas broadly as is permitted by Article III of the\nConstitution.’ ” Trafficante , supra , at 209\n(quoting Hackett v. McGuire Brothers, Inc. , 445\nF. 2d 442, 446 (CA3 1971)); see Gladstone, supra , at\n109 (similar); Havens Realty , supra , at 372, 375–376\n(similar); see also Thompson v. North American Stainless,\nLP , 562 U. S. 170, 176 (2011) (“Later opinions, we must\nacknowledge, reiterate that the term ‘aggrieved’ [in the FHA]\nreaches as far as Article III permits”); Bennett v. Spear , 520 U. S. 154 –166 (1997) (“[ Trafficante ]\nheld that standing was expanded to the full extent permitted under\nArticle III by §810(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1968”). Thus, we have held that the Act allows suits by\nwhite tenants claiming that they were deprived benefits from\ninterracial associations when discriminatory rental practices kept\nminorities out of their apartment complex, Trafficante , 409\nU. S., at 209–212; a village alleging that it lost tax revenue\nand had the racial balance of its community undermined by\nracial-steering practices, Gladstone , 441 U. S. , at 110–111; and a nonprofit organization that spent money to combat\nhousing discrimination, Havens Realty , 455 U. S., at\n379. Contrary to the dissent’s view, those cases did more than\n“sugges[t]” that plaintiffs similarly situated to the City have a\ncause of action under the FHA. Post , at 5. They held as\nmuch. And the dissent is wrong to say that we characterized those\ncases as resting on “ill-considered dictum.” Post , at 4\n(quoting Thompson , supra , at 176). The “dictum” we\ncast doubt on in Thompson addressed who may sue under Title\nVII, the employment discrimination statute, not under the FHA. Finally, in 1988, when Congress amended the FHA,\nit retained without significant change the definition of “person\naggrieved” that this Court had broadly construed. Compare §810(a),\n82Stat. 85, with §5(b), 102Stat. 1619–1620 (codified at 42\nU. S. C. §3602(i)) (changing “person aggrieved” to\n“aggrieved person” and making other minor changes to the\ndefinition). Indeed, Congress “was aware of” our precedent and\n“made a considered judgment to retain the relevant statutory text,” Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive\nCommunities Project, Inc. , 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip\nop., at 13). See H. R. Rep. No. 100–711, p. 23 (1988) (stating\nthat the “bill adopts as its definition language similar to that\ncontained in Section 810 of existing law, as modified to reaffirm\nthe broad holdings of these cases” and discussing Gladstone and Havens Realty ); cf. Lorillard v. Pons , 434\nU. S. 575, 580 (1978) (Congress normally adopts our\ninterpretations of statutes when it reenacts those statute without\nchange). The Banks do not deny the broad reach of the\nwords “aggrieved person” as defined in the FHA. But they do contend\nthat those words nonetheless set boundaries that fall short of\nthose the Constitution sets. Brief for Petitioners in\nNo. 15–1112, p. 12 (Brief for Wells Fargo); Brief for\nPetitioners in No. 15–1111, pp. 19–20 (Brief for Bank of\nAmerica). The Court’s language in Trafficante , Gladstone , and Havens Realty , they argue, was\nexaggerated and unnecessary to decide the cases then before the\nCourt. See Brief for Wells Fargo 19–23; Brief for Bank of America\n27–33. Moreover, they warn that taking the Court’s words\nliterally—providing everyone with constitutional standing a cause\nof action under the FHA—would produce a legal anomaly. After all,\nin Thompson , 562 U. S., at 175–177, we held that the\nwords “ ‘person claiming to be aggrieved’ ” in Title VII\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the employment discrimination\nstatute, did not stretch that statute’s zone of interest to the\nlimits of Article III. We reasoned that such an interpretation\nwould produce farfetched results, for example, a shareholder in a\ncompany could bring a Title VII suit against the company for\ndiscriminatorily firing an employee. Ibid. The Banks say it\nwould be similarly farfetched if restaurants, plumbers, utility\ncompanies, or any other participant in the local economy could sue\nthe Banks to recover business they lost when people had to give up\ntheir homes and leave the neighborhood as a result of the Banks’\ndiscriminatory lending practices. Brief for Wells Fargo 18–19;\nBrief for Bank of America 22, 24–25. That, they believe, cannot\nhave been the intent of the Congress that enacted or amended the\nFHA. We need not discuss the Banks’ argument at\nlength, for even if we assume for argument’s sake that some form of\nit is valid, we nonetheless conclude that the City’s financial\ninjuries fall within the zone of interests that the FHA protects.\nOur case law with respect to the FHA drives that conclusion. The\nCity’s complaints allege that the Banks “intentionally targeted\npredatory practices at African-American and Latino neighborhoods\nand residents,” App. 225; id., at 409 (similar). That\nunlawful conduct led to a “concentration” of “foreclosures and\nvacancies” in those neighborhoods. Id., at 226, 229, 410,\n413. Those concentrated “foreclosures and vacancies” caused\n“stagnation and decline in African-American and Latino\nneighborhoods.” Id., at 225, 409. They hindered the City’s\nefforts to create integrated, stable neighborhoods. Id., at\n186, 351. And, highly relevant here, they reduced prop-erty values,\ndiminishing the City’s property-tax revenue and increasing demand\nfor municipal services. Id., at 233–234, 417. Those claims are similar in kind to the claims\nthe Village of Bellwood raised in Gladstone . There, the\nplaintiff village had alleged that it was “ ‘injured by having\n[its] housing market . . . wrongfully and illegally\nmanipulated to the economic and social detriment of the citizens of\n[the] village.’ ” 441 U. S., at 95 (quoting the\ncomplaint; alterations in original). We held that the village could\nbring suit. We wrote that the complaint in effect alleged that the\ndefendant-realtors’ racial steering “affect[ed] the village’s\nracial composition,” “reduce[d] the total number of buyers in the\nBellwood housing market,” “precipitate[d] an exodus of white\nresidents,” and caused “prices [to] be deflected downward.” Id., at 110. Those circumstances adversely affected the\nvillage by, among other things, producing a “significant\nreduction in property values [that] directly injures a municipality\nby diminishing its tax base, thus threatening its ability to bear\nthe costs of local government and to provide services.” Id., at 110–111 (emphasis added). The upshot is that the City alleges economic\ninjuries that arguably fall within the FHA’s zone of interests, as\nwe have previously interpreted that statute. Principles of stare\ndecisis compel our adherence to those precedents in this\ncontext. And principles of statutory interpretation require us to\nrespect Congress’ decision to ratify those precedents when it\nreenacted the relevant statutory text. See supra , at 7. III The remaining question is one of causation:\nDid the Banks’ allegedly discriminatory lending practices\nproximately cause the City to lose property-tax revenue and spend\nmore on municipal services? The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the\nanswer is “yes” because the City plausibly alleged that its\nfinancial injuries were foreseeable results of the Banks’\nmisconduct. We conclude that foreseeability alone is not sufficient\nto establish proximate cause under the FHA, and therefore vacate\nthe judgment below. It is a “ ‘well established principle of\n[the common] law that in all cases of loss, we are to attribute it\nto the proximate cause, and not to any remote cause.’ ” Lexmark , 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). We assume\nCongress “is familiar with the common-law rule and does not mean to\ndisplace it sub silentio ” in federal causes of action. Ibid. A claim for damages under the FHA—which is akin to a\n“tort action,” Meyer v. Holley , 537 U. S. 280,\n285 (2003) —is no exception to this traditional requirement.\n“Proximate-cause analysis is controlled by the nature of the\nstatutory cause of action. The question it presents is whether the\nharm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the\nstatute prohibits.” Lexmark , supra , at ___ (slip op.,\nat 14). In these cases, the “conduct the statute\nprohibits” consists of intentionally lending to minority borrowers\non worse terms than equally creditworthy nonminority borrowers and\ninducing defaults by failing to extend refinancing and loan\nmodifications to minority borrowers on fair terms. The City alleges\nthat the Banks’ misconduct led to a disproportionate number of\nforeclosures and vacancies in specific Miami neighborhoods. These\nforeclosures and vacancies purportedly harmed the City, which lost\nproperty-tax revenue when the value of the properties in those\nneighborhoods fell and was forced to spend more on municipal\nservices in the affected areas. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the City\nadequately pleaded that the Banks’ misconduct proximately caused\nthese financial injuries. 800 F. 3d, at 1282. The court held\nthat in the context of the FHA “the proper standard” for proximate\ncause “is based on foreseeability.” Id. , at 1279, 1282. The\nCity, it continued, satisfied that element: Although there are\n“several links in the causal chain” between the charged\ndiscriminatory lending practices and the claimed losses, the City\nplausibly alleged that “none are unforeseeable.” Id. , at\n1282. We conclude that the Eleventh Circuit erred in\nholding that foreseeability is sufficient to establish proximate\ncause under the FHA. As we have explained, proximate cause\n“generally bars suits for alleged harm that is ‘too remote’ from\nthe defendant’s unlawful conduct.” Lexmark , supra , at\n___ (slip op., at 14). In the context of the FHA, foreseeability\nalone does not ensure the close connection that proximate cause\nrequires. The housing market is interconnected with economic and\nsocial life. A violation of the FHA may, therefore, “ ‘be\nexpected to cause ripples of harm to flow’ ” far beyond the\ndefendant’s misconduct. Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal.,\nInc. v. Carpenters , 459 U. S. 519, 534 (1983) .\nNothing in the statute suggests that Congress intended to provide a\nremedy wherever those ripples travel. And entertaining suits to\nrecover damages for any foreseeable result of an FHA violation\nwould risk “massive and complex damages litigation.” Id., at\n545. Rather, proximate cause under the FHA requires\n“some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious\nconduct alleged.” Holmes v. Securities Investors\nProtection Corporation , 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992) . A damages\nclaim under the statute “is analogous to a number of tort actions\nrecognized at common law,” Curtis v. Loether , 415\nU. S. 189, 195 (1974) , and we have repeatedly applied\ndirectness principles to statutes with “common-law foundations,” Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp. , 547 U. S. 451,\n457 (2006) . “ ‘The general tendency’ ” in these cases,\n“ ‘in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the\nfirst step.’ ” Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New\nYork , 559 U. S. 1, 10 (2010) . What falls within that\n“first step” depends in part on the “nature of the statutory cause\nof action,” Lexmark , supra , at ___ (slip op., at 14),\nand an assessment “ ‘of what is administratively possible and\nconvenient,’ ” Holmes , supra , at 268. The parties have asked us to draw the precise\nboundaries of proximate cause under the FHA and to determine on\nwhich side of the line the City’s financial injuries fall. We\ndecline to do so. The Eleventh Circuit grounded its decision on the\ntheory that proximate cause under the FHA is “based on\nforeseeability” alone. 800 F. 3d, at 1282. We therefore lack the\nbenefit of its judgment on how the contrary principles we have just\nstated apply to the FHA. Nor has any other court of appeals weighed\nin on the issue. The lower courts should define, in the first\ninstance, the contours of proximate cause under the FHA and decide\nhow that standard applies to the City’s claims for lost\nproperty-tax revenue and increased municipal expenses. IV The judgments of the Court of Appeals for the\nEleventh Circuit are vacated, and the cases are remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Justice Gorsuch took no part in the\nconsideration or decision of these cases.",

COLORADO certiorari to the supreme court of\ncolorado No. 15–606. Argued October 11, 2016—Decided\nMarch 6, 2017 A Colorado jury convicted petitioner\nPeña-Rodriguez of harassment and unlawful sexual contact. Following\nthe discharge of the jury, two jurors told defense counsel that,\nduring deliberations, Juror H. C. had expressed anti-Hispanic bias\ntoward petitioner and petitioner’s alibi witness. Counsel, with the\ntrial court’s supervision, obtained affidavits from the two jurors\ndescribing a number of biased statements by H. C. The court\nacknowledged H. C.’s apparent bias but denied petitioner’s motion\nfor a new trial on the ground that Colorado Rule of Evidence 606(b)\ngenerally prohibits a juror from testifying as to statements made\nduring deliberations in a proceeding inquiring into the validity of\nthe verdict. The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed, agreeing that\nH. C.’s alleged statements did not fall within an exception to Rule\n606(b). The Colorado Supreme Court also affirmed, relying on Tanner v. United States , 483 U. S. 107 , and Warger v. Shauers , 574 U. S. ___, both of which\nrejected constitutional challenges to the federal no-impeachment\nrule as applied to evidence of juror misconduct or bias. Held : Where a juror makes a clear\nstatement indicating that he or she relied on racial stereotypes or\nanimus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment\nrequires that the no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit\nthe trial court to consider the evidence of the juror’s statement\nand any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.\nPp. 6–21. (a) At common law jurors were forbidden\nto impeach their verdict, either by affidavit or live testimony.\nSome American jurisdictions adopted a more flexible version of the\nno-impeachment bar, known as the “Iowa rule,” which prevented\njurors from testifying only about their own subjective beliefs,\nthoughts, or motives during deliberations. An alternative approach,\nlater referred to as the federal approach, permitted an exception\nonly for events extraneous to the deliberative process. This\nCourt’s early decisions did not establish a clear preference for a\nparticular version of the no-impeachment rule, appearing open to\nthe Iowa rule in United States v. Reid , 12 How. 361,\nand Mattox v. United States , 146 U. S. 140 , but\nrejecting that approach in McDonald v. Pless , 238\nU. S. 264 . The common-law development of the rule reached\na milestone in 1975 when Congress adopted Federal Rule of Evidence\n606(b), which sets out a broad no-impeachment rule, with only\nlimited exceptions. This version of the no-impeachment rule has\nsubstantial merit, promoting full and vigorous discussion by jurors\nand providing considerable assurance that after being discharged\nthey will not be summoned to recount their deliberations or\notherwise harassed. The rule gives stability and finality to\nverdicts. Pp. 6–9. (b) Some version of the no-impeachment\nrule is followed in every State and the District of Columbia, most\nof which follow the Federal Rule. At least 16 jurisdictions have\nrecognized an exception for juror testimony about racial bias in\ndeliberations. Three Federal Courts of Appeals have also held or\nsuggested there is a constitutional exception for evidence of\nracial bias. In addressing the common-law no-impeachment\nrule, this Court noted the possibility of an exception in the\n“gravest and most important cases.” United States v. Reid , supra, at 366; McDonald v. Pless , supra, at 269. The Court has addressed the question whether\nthe Constitution mandates an exception to Rule 606(b) just twice,\nrejecting an exception each time. In Tanner, where the\nevidence showed that some jurors were under the influence of drugs\nand alcohol during the trial, the Court identified “long-recognized\nand very substantial concerns” supporting the no-impeachment rule.\n483 U. S., at 127. The Court also outlined existing,\nsignificant safeguards for the defendant’s right to an impartial\nand competent jury beyond post-trial juror testimony: members of\nthe venire can be examined for impartiality during voir dire ; juror misconduct may be observed the court,\ncounsel, and court personnel during the trial; and jurors\nthemselves can report misconduct to the court before a verdict is\nrendered. In Warger , a civil case where the evidence\nindicated that the jury forewoman failed to disclose a prodefendant\nbias during voir dire , the Court again put substantial\nreliance on existing safeguards for a fair trial. But the Court\nalso warned, as in Reid and McDonald, that the\nno-impeachment rule may admit of exceptions for “juror bias so\nextreme that, almost by definition, the jury trial right has been\nabridged.” 574 U. S., at ___–___, n. 3. Reid , McDonald , and Warger left open the question here:\nwhether the Constitution requires an exception to the\nno-impeachment rule when a juror’s statements indicate that racial\nanimus was a significant motivating factor in his or her finding of\nguilt. Pp. 9–13. (c) The imperative to purge racial\nprejudice from the administration of justice was given new force\nand direction by the ratification of the Civil War Amendments.\n“[T]he central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate\nracial discrimination emanating from official sources in the\nStates.” McLaughlin v. Florida , 379 U. S. 184 .\nTime and again, this Court has enforced the Constitution’s\nguarantee against state-sponsored racial discrimination in the jury\nsystem. The Court has interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to\nprohibit the exclusion of jurors based on race, Strauder v. West Virginia , 100 U. S. 303 –309; struck down laws and\npractices that systematically exclude racial minorities from\njuries, see, e.g., Neal v. Delaware , 103\nU. S. 370 ; ruled that no litigant may exclude a prospective\njuror based on race, see, e.g., Batson v. Kentucky ,\n476 U. S. 79 ; and held that defendants may at times be\nentitled to ask about racial bias during voir dire, see, e.g., Ham v. South Carolina , 409 U. S. 524\n. The unmistakable principle of these precedents is that\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, “odious in all aspects, is\nespecially pernicious in the administration of justice,” Rose v. Mitchell , 443 U. S. 545 , damaging “both\nthe fact and the perception” of the jury’s role as “a vital check\nagainst the wrongful exercise of power by the State,” Powers v. Ohio , 499 U. S. 400 . Pp. 13–15. (d) This case lies at the intersection of\nthe Court’s decisions endorsing the no-impeachment rule and those\nseeking to eliminate racial bias in the jury system. Those lines of\nprecedent need not conflict. Racial bias, unlike the behavior in McDonald , Tanner , or Warger, implicates unique\nhistorical, constitutional, and institutional concerns and, if left\nunaddressed, would risk systemic injury to the administration of\njustice. It is also distinct in a pragmatic sense, for the Tanner safeguards may be less effective in rooting out\nracial bias. But while all forms of improper bias pose challenges\nto the trial process, there is a sound basis to treat racial bias\nwith added precaution. A constitutional rule that racial bias in\nthe justice system must be addressed—including, in some instances,\nafter a verdict has been entered—is necessary to prevent a systemic\nloss of confidence in jury verdicts, a confidence that is a central\npremise of the Sixth Amendment trial right. Pp. 15–17. (e) Before the no-impeachment bar can be\nset aside to allow further judicial inquiry, there must be a\nthreshold showing that one or more jurors made statements\nexhibiting overt racial bias that cast serious doubt on the\nfairness and impartiality of the jury’s deliberations and resulting\nverdict. To qualify, the statement must tend to show that racial\nanimus was a significant motivating factor in the juror’s vote to\nconvict. Whether the threshold showing has been satisfied is\ncommitted to the substantial discretion of the trial court in light\nof all the circumstances, including the content and timing of the\nalleged statements and the reliability of the proffered\nevidence. The practical mechanics of acquiring and\npresenting such evidence will no doubt be shaped and guided by\nstate rules of professional ethics and local court rules, both of\nwhich often limit counsel’s post-trial contact with jurors. The\nexperience of those jurisdictions that have already recognized a\nracial-bias exception to the no-impeachment rule, and the\nexperience of courts going forward, will inform the proper exercise\nof trial judge discretion. The Court need not address what\nprocedures a trial court must follow when confronted with a motion\nfor a new trial based on juror testimony of racial bias or the\nappropriate standard for determining when such evidence is\nsufficient to require that the verdict be set aside and a new trial\nbe granted. Standard and existing safeguards may also help prevent\nracial bias in jury deliberations, including careful voir dire and a trial court’s instructions to jurors\nabout their duty to review the evidence, deliberate together, and\nreach a verdict in a fair and impartial way, free from bias of any\nkind.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–606 _________________ MIGUEL ANGEL PENA-RODRIGUEZ, PETITIONER v. COLORADO on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\ncolorado [March 6, 2017] Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. The jury is a central foundation of our justice\nsystem and our democracy. Whatever its imperfections in a\nparticular case, the jury is a necessary check on governmental\npower. The jury, over the centuries, has been an inspired, trusted,\nand effective instrument for resolving factual disputes and\ndetermining ultimate questions of guilt or innocence in criminal\ncases. Over the long course its judgments find acceptance in the\ncommunity, an acceptance essential to respect for the rule of law.\nThe jury is a tangible implementation of the principle that the law\ncomes from the people. In the era of our Nation’s founding, the right\nto a jury trial already had existed and evolved for centuries,\nthrough and alongside the common law. The jury was considered a\nfundamental safeguard of individual liberty. See The Federalist No.\n83, p. 451 (B. Warner ed. 1818) (A. Hamilton). The right to a jury\ntrial in criminal cases was part of the Constitution as first\ndrawn, and it was restated in the Sixth Amendment. Art. III,\n§2, cl. 3; Amdt. 6. By operation of the Fourteenth Amendment,\nit is applicable to the States. Duncan v. Louisiana ,\n391 U. S. 145 –150 (1968). Like all human institutions, the jury system has\nits flaws, yet experience shows that fair and impartial verdicts\ncan be reached if the jury follows the court’s instructions and\nundertakes deliberations that are honest, candid, robust, and based\non common sense. A general rule has evolved to give substantial\nprotection to verdict final-ity and to assure jurors that, once\ntheir verdict has been entered, it will not later be called into\nquestion based on the comments or conclusions they expressed during\ndeliberations. This principle, itself centuries old, is often\nreferred to as the no-impeachment rule. The instant case presents\nthe question whether there is an exception to the no-impeachment\nrule when, after the jury is discharged, a juror comes forward with\ncompelling evidence that an-other juror made clear and explicit\nstatements indicating that racial animus was a significant\nmotivating factor in his or her vote to convict. I State prosecutors in Colorado brought criminal\ncharges against petitioner, Miguel Angel Peña-Rodriguez, based on\nthe following allegations. In 2007, in the bathroom of a Colorado\nhorse-racing facility, a man sexually assaulted two teenage\nsisters. The girls told their father and identified the man as an\nemployee of the racetrack. The police located and arrested\npetitioner. Each girl separately identified petitioner as the man\nwho had assaulted her. The State charged petitioner with harassment,\nunlawful sexual contact, and attempted sexual assault on a child.\nBefore the jury was empaneled, members of the venire were\nrepeatedly asked whether they believed that they could be fair and\nimpartial in the case. A written questionnaire asked if there was\n“anything about you that you feel would make it difficult for you\nto be a fair juror.” App. 14. The court repeated the question to\nthe panel of prospective jurors and encouraged jurors to speak in\nprivate with the court if they had any concerns about their\nimpartiality. Defense counsel likewise asked whether anyone felt\nthat “this is simply not a good case” for them to be a fair juror. Id., at 34. None of the empaneled jurors expressed any\nreservations based on racial or any other bias. And none asked to\nspeak with the trial judge. After a 3-day trial, the jury found petitioner\nguilty of unlawful sexual contact and harassment, but it failed to\nreach a verdict on the attempted sexual assault charge. When the\njury was discharged, the court gave them this instruction, as\nmandated by Colorado law: “The question may arise whether you may\nnow discuss this case with the lawyers, defendant, or other\npersons. For your guidance the court instructs you that whether you\ntalk to anyone is entirely your own decision. . . . If\nany person persists in discussing the case over your objection, or\nbecomes critical of your service either before or after any\ndiscussion has begun, please report it to me.” Id., at\n85–86. Following the discharge of the jury,\npetitioner’s counsel entered the jury room to discuss the trial\nwith the jurors. As the room was emptying, two jurors remained to\nspeak with counsel in private. They stated that, during\ndeliberations, another juror had expressed anti-Hispanic bias\ntoward petitioner and petitioner’s alibi witness. Petitioner’s\ncounsel reported this to the court and, with the court’s\nsupervision, obtained sworn affidavits from the two jurors. The affidavits by the two jurors described a\nnumber of biased statements made by another juror, identified as\nJuror H. C. According to the two jurors, H. C. told the\nother jurors that he “believed the defendant was guilty because, in\n[H. C.’s] experience as an ex-law enforcement officer, Mexican\nmen had a bravado that caused them to believe they could do\nwhatever they wanted with women.” Id ., at 110. The jurors\nreported that H. C. stated his belief that Mexican men are\nphysically controlling of women because of their sense of\nentitlement, and further stated, “ ‘I think he did it because\nhe’s Mexican and Mexican men take whatever they want.’ ” Id., at 109. According to the jurors, H. C. further\nexplained that, in his experience, “nine times out of ten Mexican\nmen were guilty of being aggressive toward women and young girls.” Id., at 110. Finally, the jurors recounted that Juror\nH. C. said that he did not find petitioner’s alibi witness\ncredible because, among other things, the witness was “ ‘an\nillegal.’ ” Ibid. (In fact, the witness testified\nduring trial that he was a legal resident of the United\nStates.) After reviewing the affidavits, the trial court\nacknowledged H. C.’s apparent bias. But the court denied\npetitioner’s motion for a new trial, noting that “[t]he actual\ndeliberations that occur among the jurors are protected from\ninquiry under [Colorado Rule of Evidence] 606(b).” Id ., at\n90. Like its federal counterpart, Colorado’s Rule 606(b) generally\nprohibits a juror from testifying as to any statement made during\ndeliberations in a proceeding inquiring into the validity of the\nverdict. See Fed. Rule Evid. 606(b). The Colorado Rule reads as\nfollows: “(b) Inquiry into validity of verdict or\nindictment. Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or\nindictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement\noccurring during the course of the jury’s deliberations or to the\neffect of anything upon his or any other juror’s mind or emotions\nas influencing him to assent to or dissent from the verdict or\nindictment or concerning his mental processes in connection\ntherewith. But a juror may testify about (1) whether extraneous\nprejudicial information was improperly brought to the jurors’\nattention, (2) whether any outside influence was improperly brought\nto bear upon any juror, or (3) whether there was a mistake in\nentering the verdict onto the verdict form. A juror’s affidavit or\nevidence of any statement by the juror may not be received on a\nmatter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying.”\nColo. Rule Evid. 606(b) (2016). The verdict deemed final, petitioner was\nsentenced to two years’ probation and was required to register as a\nsex offender. A divided panel of the Colorado Court of Appeals\naffirmed petitioner’s conviction, agreeing that H. C.’s\nalleged statements did not fall within an exception to Rule 606(b)\nand so were inadmissible to undermine the validity of the verdict.\n___ P. 3d ___, 2012 WL 5457362. The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed by a vote of\n4 to 3. 350 P. 3d 287 (2015). The prevailing opinion relied on\ntwo decisions of this Court rejecting constitutional challenges to\nthe federal no-impeachment rule as applied to evidence of juror\nmisconduct or bias. See Tanner v. United States , 483\nU. S. 107 (1987) ; Warger v. Shauers , 574\nU. S. ___ (2014). After reviewing those precedents, the court\ncould find no “dividing line between different types of\njuror bias or misconduct,” and thus no basis for permitting\nimpeachment of the verdicts in petitioner’s trial, notwithstanding\nH. C.’s apparent racial bias. 350 P. 3d, at 293. This\nCourt granted certiorari to decide whether there is a\nconstitutional exception to the no-impeachment rule for instances\nof racial bias. 578 U. S. ___ (2016). Juror H. C.’s bias was based on\npetitioner’s Hispanic identity, which the Court in prior cases has\nreferred to as ethnicity, and that may be an instructive term here.\nSee, e.g., Hernandez v. New York , 500 U. S. 352,\n355 (1991) (plurality opinion). Yet we have also used the language\nof race when discussing the relevant constitutional principles in\ncases involving Hispanic persons. See, e.g., ibid. ; Fisher v. University of Tex. at Austin , 570\nU. S. ___ (2013); Rosales-Lopez v. United\nStates , 451 U. S. 182 –190 (1981) (plurality opinion).\nPetitioner and respondent both refer to race, or to race and\nethnicity, in this more expansive sense in their briefs to the\nCourt. This opinion refers to the nature of the bias as racial in\nkeeping with the primary terminology employed by the parties and\nused in our precedents. II A At common law jurors were forbidden to impeach\ntheir verdict, either by affidavit or live testimony. This rule\noriginated in Vaise v. Delaval , 1 T. R. 11, 99 Eng.\nRep. 944 (K. B. 1785). There, Lord Mansfield excluded juror\ntestimony that the jury had decided the case through a game of\nchance. The Mansfield rule, as it came to be known, prohibited\njurors, after the verdict was entered, from testifying either about\ntheir subjective mental processes or about objective events that\noccurred during deliberations. American courts adopted the Mansfield rule as a\nmatter of common law, though not in every detail. Some\njurisdictions adopted a different, more flexible version of the\nno-impeachment bar known as the “Iowa rule.” Under that rule,\njurors were prevented only from testifying about their own\nsubjective beliefs, thoughts, or motives during deliberations. See Wright v. Illinois & Miss. Tel. Co. , 20 Iowa 195\n(1866). Jurors could, however, testify about objective facts and\nevents occurring during deliberations, in part because other jurors\ncould corroborate that testimony. An alternative approach, later referred to as\nthe federal approach, stayed closer to the original Mansfield rule.\nSee Warger , supra , at ___ (slip op., at 5) . Under this version of the rule, the no-impeachment bar permitted an\nexception only for testimony about events extraneous to the\ndeliberative process, such as reliance on outside\nevidence—newspapers, dictionaries, and the like—or personal\ninvestigation of the facts. This Court’s early decisions did not establish a\nclear preference for a particular version of the no-impeachment\nrule. In United States v. Reid , 12 How. 361 (1852),\nthe Court appeared open to the admission of juror testimony that\nthe jurors had consulted newspapers during deliberations, but in\nthe end it barred the evidence because the newspapers “had not the\nslightest influence” on the verdict. Id., at 366. The Reid Court warned that juror testimony “ought always to be\nreceived with great caution.” Ibid. Yet it added an\nimportant admonition: “cases might arise in which it would be\nimpossible to refuse” juror testimony “without violating the\nplainest principles of justice.” Ibid. In a following case the Court required the\nadmission of juror affidavits stating that the jury consulted\ninformation that was not in evidence, including a prejudicial\nnews-paper article. Mattox v. United States , 146\nU. S. 140, 151 (1892) . The Court suggested, furthermore, that\nthe admission of juror testimony might be governed by a more\nflexible rule, one permitting jury testimony even where it did not\ninvolve consultation of prejudicial extraneous information. Id., at 148–149; see also Hyde v. United\nStates , 225 U. S. 347 –384 (1912) (stating that the more\nflexible Iowa rule “should apply,” but excluding evidence that the\njury reached the verdict by trading certain defendants’ acquittals\nfor others’ convictions). Later, however, the Court rejected the more\nlenient Iowa rule. In McDonald v. Pless , 238\nU. S. 264 (1915) , the Court affirmed the exclusion of juror\ntestimony about objective events in the jury room. There, the jury\nallegedly had calculated a damages award by averaging thenumerical\nsubmissions of each member. Id., at 265–266. As the Court\nexplained, admitting that evidence would have “dangerous\nconsequences”: “no verdict would be safe” and the practice would\n“open the door to the most pernicious arts and tampering with\njurors.” Id. , at 268 (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet\nthe Court reiterated its admonition from Reid , again\ncautioning that the no-impeachment rule might recognize exceptions\n“in the gravest and most important cases” where exclusion of juror\naffidavits might well violate “the plainest principles of justice.”\n238 U. S ., at 269 (quoting Reid , supra ,\nat 366; internal quotation marks omitted). The common-law development of the no-impeachment\nrule reached a milestone in 1975, when Congress adopted the Federal\nRules of Evidence, including Rule 606(b). Congress, like the McDonald Court, rejected the Iowa rule. Instead it endorsed\na broad no-impeachment rule, with only limited exceptions. The version of the rule that Congress adopted\nwas “no accident.” Warger , 574 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 7). The Advisory Committee at first drafted a rule reflecting\nthe Iowa approach, prohibiting admission of juror testimony only as\nit related to jurors’ mental processes in reaching a verdict. The\nDepartment of Justice, however, expressed concern over the\npreliminary rule. The Advisory Committee then drafted the more\nstringent version now in effect, prohibiting all juror testimony,\nwith exceptions only where the jury had considered prejudicial\nextraneous evidence or was subject to other outside influence.\nRules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates, 56\nF. R. D. 183, 265 (1972). The Court adopted this second\nversion and transmitted it to Congress. The House favored the Iowa approach, but the\nSenate expressed concern that it did not sufficiently address the\npublic policy interest in the finality of verdicts. S. Rep.\nNo. 93–1277, pp. 13–14 (1974). Siding with the Senate, the\nConference Committee adopted, Congress enacted, and the President\nsigned the Court’s proposed rule. The substance of the Rule has not\nchanged since 1975, except for a 2006 modification permitting\nevidence of a clerical mistake on the verdict form. See 574\nU. S., at ___. The current version of Rule 606(b) states as\nfollows: “(1) Prohibited Testimony or Other\nEvidence . During an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or\nindictment, a juror may not testify about any statement made or\nincident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the effect\nof anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s\nmental processes concerning the verdict or indictment. The court\nmay not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s\nstatement on these matters. “(2) Exceptions. A juror may testify\nabout whether: “(A) extraneous prejudicial information was\nimproperly brought to the jury’s attention; “(B) an outside influence was improperly\nbrought to bear on any juror; or “(C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict\non the verdict form.” This version of the no-impeachment rule has\nsubstantial merit. It promotes full and vigorous discussion by\nproviding jurors with considerable assurance that after being\ndischarged they will not be summoned to recount their\ndeliberations, and they will not otherwise be harassed or annoyed\nby litigants seeking to challenge the verdict. The rule gives\nstability and finality to verdicts. B Some version of the no-impeachment rule is\nfollowed in every State and the District of Columbia. Variations\nmake classification imprecise, but, as a general matter, it appears\nthat 42 jurisdictions follow the Federal Rule, while 9 follow the\nIowa Rule. Within both classifications there is a diversity of\napproaches. Nine jurisdictions that follow the Federal Rule have\ncodified exceptions other than those listed in Federal Rule 606(b).\nSee Appendix, infra . At least 16 jurisdictions, 11 of which\nfollow the Federal Rule, have recognized an exception to the\nno-impeachment bar under the circumstances the Court faces here:\njuror testimony that racial bias played a part in deliberations. Ibid. According to the parties and amici , only one\nState other than Colorado has addressed this issue and declined to\nrecognize an exception for racial bias. See Commonwealth v. Steele , 599 Pa. 341, 377–379, 961 A. 2d 786, 807–808\n(2012). The federal courts, for their part, are governed\nby Federal Rule 606(b), but their interpretations deserve further\ncomment. Various Courts of Appeals have had occasion to consider a\nracial bias exception and have reached different conclusions. Three\nhave held or suggested there is a constitutional exception for\nevidence of racial bias. See United States v. Villar ,\n586 F. 3d 76, 87–88 (CA1 2009) (holding the Constitution\ndemands a racial-bias exception); United States v. Henley , 238 F. 3d 1111, 1119–1121 (CA9 2001) (finding\npersuasive arguments in favor of an exception but not deciding the\nissue); Shillcutt v. Gagnon , 827 F. 2d 1155,\n1158–1160 (CA7 1987) (observing that in some cases fundamental\nfairness could require an exception). One Court of Appeals has\ndeclined to find an exception, reasoning that other safeguards\ninherent in the trial process suffice to protect defendants’\nconstitutional interests. See United States v. Benally , 546 F. 3d 1230, 1240–1241 (CA10 2008). Another\nhas suggested as much, holding in the habeas context that an\nexception for racial bias was not clearly established but\nindicating in dicta that no such exception exists. See Williams v. Price , 343 F. 3d 223, 237–239 (CA3\n2003) (Alito, J.). And one Court of Appeals has held that evidence\nof racial bias is excluded by Rule 606(b), without addressing\nwhether the Constitution may at times demand an exception. See Martinez v. Food City, Inc. , 658 F. 2d 369,\n373–374 (CA5 1981). C In addressing the scope of the common-law\nno-impeachment rule before Rule 606(b)’s adoption, the Reid and McDonald Courts noted the possibility of an exception to\nthe rule in the “gravest and most important cases.” Reid , 12\nHow., at 366; McDonald , 238 U. S., at 269. Yet since\nthe enactment of Rule 606(b), the Court has addressed the precise\nquestion whether the Constitution mandates an exception to it in\njust two instances. In its first case, Tanner , 483 U. S.\n107 , the Court rejected a Sixth Amendment exception for evidence\nthat some jurors were under the influence of drugs and alcohol\nduring the trial. Id. , at 125. Central to the Court’s\nreasoning were the “long-recognized and very substantial concerns”\nsupporting “the protection of jury deliberations from intrusive\ninquiry.” Id., at 127. The Tanner Court echoed McDonald ’s concern that, if attorneys could use juror\ntestimony to attack verdicts, jurors would be “harassed and beset\nby the defeated party,” thus destroying “all frankness and freedom\nof discussion and conference.” 483 U. S., at 120 (quoting McDonald , supra, at 267–268). The Court was\nconcerned, moreover, that attempts to impeach a verdict would\n“disrupt the finality of the process” and undermine both “jurors’\nwillingness to return an unpopular verdict” and “the community’s\ntrust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople.” 483\nU. S., at 120–121. The Tanner Court outlined existing,\nsignificant safeguards for the defendant’s right to an impartial\nand competent jury beyond post-trial juror testimony. At the outset\nof the trial process, voir dire provides an\nopportun-ity for the court and counsel to examine members of the\nvenire for impartiality. As a trial proceeds, the court, counsel,\nand court personnel have some opportunity to learn of any juror\nmisconduct. And, before the verdict, jurors themselves can report\nmisconduct to the court. These procedures do not undermine the\nstability of a verdict once rendered. Even after the trial,\nevidence of misconduct other than juror testimony can be used to\nattempt to impeach the verdict. Id., at 127. Balancing these\ninterests and safeguards against the defendant’s Sixth Amendment\ninterest in that case, the Court affirmed the exclusion of\naffidavits pertaining to the jury’s inebri-ated state. Ibid. The second case to consider the general issue\npresented here was Warger , 574 U. S. ___. The Court\nagain rejected the argument that, in the circumstances there, the\njury trial right required an exception to the no-impeachment rule. Warger involved a civil case where, after the verdict was\nentered, the losing party sought to proffer evidence that the jury\nforewoman had failed to disclose prodefendant bias during voir dire . As in Tanner , the Court put\nsubstantial reliance on existing safeguards for a fair trial. The\nCourt stated: “Even if jurors lie in voir dire in a way\nthat conceals bias, juror impartiality is adequately assured by the\nparties’ ability to bring to the court’s attention any evidence of\nbias before the verdict is rendered, and to employ nonjuror\nevidence even after the verdict is rendered.” 574 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 10). In Warger , however, the Court did\nreiterate that the no-impeachment rule may admit exceptions. As in Reid and McDonald , the Court warned of “juror bias so\nextreme that, almost by definition, the jury trial right has been\nabridged.” 574 U. S., at ___–___, n. 3 (slip op., at\n10–11, n. 3). “If and when such a case arises,” the Court\nindicated it would “consider whether the usual safeguards are orare\nnot sufficient to protect the integrity of the process.” Ibid. The recognition in Warger that there may\nbe extreme cases where the jury trial right requires an exception\nto the no-impeachment rule must be interpreted in context as a\nguarded, cautious statement. This caution is warranted to avoid\nformulating an exception that might undermine the jury dynamics and\nfinality interests the no-impeachment rule seeks to protect. Today,\nhowever, the Court faces the question that Reid , McDonald , and Warger left open. The Court must decide\nwhether the Constitution requires an exception to the\nno-impeachment rule when a juror’s statements indicate that racial\nanimus was a significant motivating factor in his or her finding of\nguilt. III It must become the heritage of our Nation to\nrise above racial classifications that are so inconsistent with our\ncommitment to the equal dignity of all persons. This imperative to\npurge",

DAVIS, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL\nJUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth\ncircuit No. 15–8049. Argued October 5, 2016—Decided February 22,\n2017 Petitioner Duane Buck was convicted of capital murder in a Texas\ncourt. Under state law, the jury was permitted to impose a death\nsentence only if it found unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat Buck was likely to commit acts of violence in the future.\nBuck’s attorney called a psychologist, Dr. Walter Quijano, to offer\nhis opinion on that issue. Dr. Quijano had been appointed to\nevaluate Buck by the presiding judge and had prepared a report\nsetting out his conclusions. To determine the likelihood that Buck\nwould act violently in the future, Dr. Quijano had considered a\nnumber of statistical factors, including Buck’s race. Although Dr.\nQuijano ultimately concluded that Buck was unlikely to be a future\ndanger, his report also stated that Buck was statistically more\nlikely to act violently because he is black. The report read, in\nrelevant part: “Race. Black: Increased probability.” App. 19a.\nDespite knowing the contents of the report, Buck’s counsel called\nDr. Quijano to the stand, where he testified that race is a factor\n“know[n] to predict future dangerousness.” Id., at 146a. Dr.\nQuijano’s report was admitted into evidence at the close of his\ntestimony. The prosecution questioned Dr. Quijano about his\nconclusions on race and violence during cross-examination, and it\nrelied on his testimony in summation. During deliberations, the\njury requested and received the expert reports admitted into\nevidence, including Dr. Quijano’s. The jury returned a sentence of\ndeath. Buck contends that his attorney’s introduction of this evidence\nviolated his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of\ncounsel. Buck failed to raise this claim in his first state\npostconviction proceeding. While that proceeding was pending, this\nCourt received a petition for certiorari in Saldano v. Texas ,530 U. S. 1212, a case in which Dr. Quijano had\ntestified that the petitioner’s Hispanic heritage weighed in favor\nof a finding of future dangerousness. Texas confessed error on that\nground, and this Court vacated the judgment below. Soon afterward,\nthe Texas Attorney General issued a public statement identifying\nsix similar cases in which Dr. Quijano had testified. Buck’s was\none of them. In the other five cases, the Attorney General\nconfessed error and consented to resentencing. But when Buck filed\na second state habeas petition alleging that his attorney had been\nineffective in introducing Dr. Quijano’s testimony, the State did\nnot confess error, and the court dismissed the petition as an abuse\nof the writ on the ground that Buck had failed to raise the claim\nin his first petition. Buck then sought federal habeas relief under28\nU. S. C. §2254. The State again declined to confess\nerror, and Buck’s ineffective assistance claim was held\nprocedurally defaulted and unreviewable under Coleman v. Thompson ,501 U. S. 722. This Court’s later decisions in Martinez v. Ryan ,566 U. S. 1, and Trevino v. Thaler , 569 U. S. ___, modified the rule of Coleman . Had they been decided before Buck filed his federal\nhabeas petition, Buck’s claim could have been heard on the merits\nprovided he had demonstrated that (1) state postconviction counsel\nhad been constitutionally ineffective in failing to raise the\nclaim, and (2) the claim had some merit. Following the decision in Trevino , Buck sought to reopen his §2254 case under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6). To demonstrate the “extraordinary\ncircumstances” required for relief, Gonzalez v. Crosby ,545 U. S. 524, Buck cited the change in law\neffected by Martinez and Trevino , as well as ten\nother factors, including the introduction of expert testimony\nlinking Buck’s race to violence and the State’s confession of error\nin similar cases. The District Court denied relief. Reasoning that\n“the introduction of any mention of race” during Buck’s sentencing\nwas “ de minimis ,” the court concluded, first, that Buck had\nfailed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances; and second, that\neven if the circumstances were extraordinary, Buck had failed to\ndemonstrate ineffective assistance under Strickland v. Washington ,466 U. S. 668. Buck sought a certificate of\nappealability (COA) from the Fifth Circuit to appeal the denial of\nhis Rule 60(b)(6) motion. The Fifth Circuit denied his application,\nconcluding that he had not shown extraordinary circumstances\njustifying relief from the District Court’s judgment. Held : 1. The Fifth Circuit exceeded the limited scope of the COA\nanalysis. The COA statute sets forth a two-step process: an initial\ndetermination whether a claim is reasonably debatable, and, if so,\nan appeal in the normal course.28 U. S. C. §2253. At the\nfirst stage, the only question is whether the applicant has shown\nthat “jurists of reason could disagree with the district court’s\nresolution of his constitutional claims or . . . could\nconclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement\nto proceed further.” Miller-El v. Cockrell ,537\nU. S. 322. Here, the Fifth Circuit phrased its determination\nin proper terms. But it reached its conclusion only after\nessentially deciding the case on the merits, repeatedly faulting\nBuck for having failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances.\nThe question for the Court of Appeals was not whether Buck had\nshown that his case is extraordinary; it was whether jurists of\nreason could debate that issue. The State points to the Fifth\nCircuit’s thorough consideration of the merits to defend that\ncourt’s approach, but this hurts rather than helps its case.\nPp. 12–15. 2. Buck has demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel\nunder Strickland . Pp. 15–20. (a) To satisfy Strickland , a defendant must first\nshow that counsel performed deficiently. 466 U. S., at 687.\nBuck’s trial counsel knew that Dr. Quijano’s report reflected the\nview that Buck’s race predisposed him to violent conduct and that\nthe principal point of dispute during the penalty phase was Buck’s\nfuture dangerousness. Counsel nevertheless called Dr. Quijano to\nthe stand, specifically elicited testimony about the connection\nbetween race and violence, and put Dr. Quijano’s report into\nevidence. No competent defense attorney would introduce evidence\nthat his client is liable to be a future danger because of his\nrace. Pp. 15–17. (b) Strickland further requires a defendant to\ndemonstrate prejudice—“a reasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would\nhave been different.” 466 U. S., at 694. It is reasonably\nprobable that without Dr. Quijano’s testimony on race and violence,\nat least one juror would have harbored a reasonable doubt on the\nquestion of Buck’s future dangerousness. This issue required the\njury to make a predictive judgment inevitably entailing a degree of\nspeculation. But Buck’s race was not subject to speculation, and\naccording to Dr. Quijano, that immutable characteristic carried\nwith it an increased probability of future violence. Dr. Quijano’s\ntestimony appealed to a powerful racial stereotype and might well\nhave been valued by jurors as the opinion of a medical expert\nbearing the court’s imprimatur. For these reasons, the District\nCourt’s conclusion that any mention of race during the penalty\nphase was de minimis is rejected. So is the State’s argument\nthat Buck was not prejudiced by Dr. Quijano’s testimony because it\nwas introduced by his own counsel, rather than the prosecution.\nJurors understand that prosecutors seek convictions and may\nreasonably be expected to evaluate the government’s evidence in\nlight of its motivations. When damaging evidence is introduced by a\ndefendant’s own lawyer, it is in the nature of an admission against\ninterest, more likely to be taken at face value.\nPp. 17–20. 3. The District Court’s denial of Buck’s Rule 60(b)(6)\nmotion was an abuse of discretion. Pp. 20–26. (a) Relief under Rule 60(b)(6) is available only in\n“extraordinary circumstances.” Gonzalez , 545 U. S., at\n535. Determining whether such circumstances are present may include\nconsideration of a wide range of factors, including “the risk of\ninjustice to the parties” and “the risk of undermining the public’s\nconfidence in the judicial process.” Liljeberg v. Health\nServices Acquisition Corp. ,486 U. S. 847–864. The District\nCourt’s denial of Buck’s motion rested largely on its determination\nthat race played only a de minimis role in his sentencing.\nBut there is a reasonable probability that Buck was sentenced to\ndeath in part because of his race. This is a disturbing departure\nfrom the basic premise that our criminal law punishes people for\nwhat they do, not who they are. That it concerned race amplifies\nthe problem. Relying on race to impose a criminal sanction “poisons\npublic confidence” in the judicial process, Davis v. Ayala , 576 U. S. ___, ___, a concern that supports Rule\n60(b)(6) relief. The extraordinary nature of this case is confirmed\nby the remarkable steps the State itself took in response to Dr.\nQuijano’s testimony in other cases. Although the State attempts to\njustify its decision to treat Buck differently from the other five\ndefendants identified in the Attorney General’s public statement,\nits explanations for distinguishing Buck’s case from Saldano have nothing to do with the Attorney General’s stated reasons for\nconfessing error in that case. Pp. 20–24. (b) Unless Martinez and Trevino, rather than Coleman, would govern Buck’s case were it reopened, his\nclaim would remain unreviewable and Rule 60(b)(6) relief would be\ninappropriate. The State argues that Martinez and Trevino would not govern Buck’s case because they announced\na “new rule” under Teague v. Lane ,489 U. S. 288,\nthat does not apply retroactively to cases (like Buck’s) on\ncollateral review. This argument, however, has been waived: the\nState failed to advance it in District Court, before the Fifth\nCircuit, or in its brief in opposition to Buck’s petition for\ncertiorari. Pp. 24–26. 623 Fed. Appx. 668, reversed and remanded. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in\nwhich Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.\nThomas, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Alito, J.,\njoined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–8049 _________________ DUANE EDWARD BUCK, PETITIONER v. LORIE DAVIS, DIRECTOR,\nTEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS\nDIVISION on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for\nthe fifth circuit [February 22, 2017] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court. A Texas jury convicted petitioner Duane Buck of capital murder.\nUnder state law, the jury could impose a death sentence only if it\nfound that Buck was likely to commit acts of violence in the\nfuture. Buck’s attorney called a psychologist to offer his opinion\non that issue. The psychologist testified that Buck probably would\nnot engage in violent conduct. But he also stated that one of the\nfactors pertinent in assessing a person’s propensity for violence\nwas his race, and that Buck was statistically more likely to act\nviolently because he is black. The jury sentenced Buck to\ndeath. Buck contends that his attorney’s introduction of this evidence\nviolated his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of\ncounsel. This claim has never been heard on the merits in any\ncourt, because the attorney who represented Buck in his first state\npostconviction proceeding failed to raise it. In 2006, a Federal\nDistrict Court relied on that failure—properly, under\nthen-governing law—to hold that Buck’s claim was procedurally\ndefaulted and unreviewable. In 2014, Buck sought to reopen that 2006 judgment by filing a\nmotion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6). He argued\nthat this Court’s decisions in Martinez v. Ryan ,566\nU. S. 1 (2012), and Trevino v. Thaler , 569\nU. S. ___ (2013), had changed the law in a way that provided\nan excuse for his procedural default, permitting him to litigate\nhis claim on the merits. In addition to this change in the law,\nBuck’s motion identified ten other factors that, he said,\nconstituted the “extraordinary circumstances” required to justify\nreopening the 2006 judgment under the Rule. See Gonzalez v. Crosby ,545 U. S. 524,535 (2005). The District Court below denied the motion, and the Fifth\nCircuit declined to issue the certificate of appealability (COA)\nrequested by Buck to appeal that decision. We granted certiorari,\nand now reverse. I A On the morning of July 30, 1995, Duane Buck arrived at the home\nof his former girlfriend, Debra Gardner. He was carrying a rifle\nand a shotgun. Buck entered the home, shot Phyllis Taylor, his\nstepsister, and then shot Gardner’s friend Kenneth Butler. Gardner\nfled the house, and Buck followed. So did Gardner’s young children.\nWhile Gardner’s son and daughter begged for their mother’s life,\nBuck shot Gardner in the chest. Gardner and Butler died of their\nwounds. Taylor survived. Police officers arrived soon after the shooting and placed Buck\nunder arrest. An officer would later testify that Buck was laughing\nat the scene. He remained “happy” and “upbeat” as he was driven to\nthe police station, “[s]miling and laughing” in the back of the\npatrol car. App. 134a–135a, 252a. Buck was tried for capital murder, and the jury convicted.\nDuring the penalty phase of the trial, the jury was charged with\ndeciding two issues. The first was what the parties term the\n“future dangerousness” question. At the time of Buck’s trial, a\nTexas jury could impose the death penalty only if it\nfound—unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt—“a probability that\nthe defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would\nconstitute a continuing threat to society.” Tex. Code Crim. Proc.\nAnn., Art. 37.071, §2(b)(1) (Vernon 1998). The second issue, to be\nreached only if the jury found Buck likely to be a future danger,\nwas whether mitigating circumstances nevertheless warranted a\nsentence of life imprisonment instead of death. See §2(e). The parties focused principally on the first question. The State\ncalled witnesses who emphasized the brutality of Buck’s crime and\nhis evident lack of remorse in its aftermath. The State also called\nanother former girlfriend, Vivian Jackson. She testified that,\nduring their relationship, Buck had routinely hit her and had twice\npointed a gun at her. Finally, the State introduced evidence of\nBuck’s criminal history, including convictions for delivery of\ncocaine and unlawfully carrying a weapon. App. 125a–127a, 185a. Defense counsel answered with a series of lay witnesses,\nincluding Buck’s father and stepmother, who testified that they had\nnever known him to be violent. Counsel also called two\npsychologists to testify as experts. The first, Dr. Patrick\nLawrence, observed that Buck had previously served time in prison\nand had been held in minimum custody. From this he concluded that\nBuck “did not present any problems in the prison setting.” Record\nin No. 4:04–cv–03965 (SD Tex.), Doc. 5–116, pp. 12–13. Dr. Lawrence\nfurther testified that murders within the Texas penal system tend\nto be gang related (there was no evidence Buck had ever been a\nmember of a gang) and that Buck’s offense had been a “crime of\npassion” occurring within the context of a romantic relationship. Id., at 4, 19, 21. Based on these considerations, Dr.\nLawrence determined that Buck was unlikely to be a danger if he\nwere sentenced to life in prison. Id., at 20–21. Buck’s second expert, Dr. Walter Quijano, had been appointed by\nthe presiding judge to conduct a psychological evaluation. Dr.\nQuijano had met with Buck in prison prior to trial and shared a\nreport of his findings with defense counsel. Like Dr. Lawrence, Dr. Quijano thought it significant that\nBuck’s prior acts of violence had arisen from romantic\nrelationships with women; Buck, of course, would not form any such\nrelationships while incarcerated. And Dr. Quijano likewise\nconsidered Buck’s behavioral record in prison a good indicator that\nfuture violence was unlikely. App. 36a, 39a–40a. But there was more to the report. In determining whether Buck\nwas likely to pose a danger in the future, Dr. Quijano considered\nseven “statistical factors.” The fourth factor was “race.” His\nreport read, in relevant part: “4. Race. Black: Increased\nprobability. There is an over-representation of Blacks among the\nviolent offenders.” Id., at 19a. Despite knowing Dr. Quijano’s view that Buck’s race was\ncompetent evidence of an increased probability of future violence,\ndefense counsel called Dr. Quijano to the stand and asked him to\ndiscuss the “statistical factors” he had “looked at in regard to\nthis case.” Id., at 145a–146a. Dr. Quijano responded that\ncertain factors were “know[n] to predict future dangerousness” and,\nconsistent with his report, identified race as one of them. Id., at 146a. “It’s a sad commentary,” he testified, “that\nminorities, Hispanics and black people, are over represented in the\nCriminal Justice System.” Ibid. Through further questioning,\ncounsel elicited testimony concerning factors Dr. Quijano thought\nfavorable to Buck, as well as his ultimate opinion that Buck was\nunlikely to pose a danger in the future. At the close of Dr.\nQuijano’s testimony, his report was admitted into evidence. Id., at 150a–152a. After opening cross-examination with a series of general\nquestions, the prosecutor likewise turned to the report. She asked\nfirst about the statistical factors of past crimes and age, then\nquestioned Dr. Quijano about the roles of sex and race: “You have\ndetermined that the sex factor, that a male is more violent than a\nfemale because that’s just the way it is, and that the race factor,\nblack, increases the future dangerousness for various complicated\nreasons; is that correct?” Id., at 170a. Dr. Quijano\nreplied, “Yes.” Ibid. During closing arguments, defense counsel emphasized that Buck\nhad proved to be “controllable in the prison population,” and that\nhis crime was one of “jealousy, . . . passion and\nemotion” unlikely to be repeated in jail. Id., at 189a–191a.\nThe State stressed the crime’s brutal nature and Buck’s lack of\nremorse, along with the inability of Buck’s own experts to\nguarantee that he would not act violently in the future—a point it\nsupported by reference to Dr. Quijano’s testimony. See id., at 198a–199a (“You heard from Dr. Quijano, . . . who told\nyou that . . . the probability did exist that [Buck]\nwould be a continuing threat to society.”). The jury deliberated over the course of two days. During that\ntime it sent out four notes, one of which requested the “psychology\nreports” that had been admitted into evidence. Id., at 209a.\nThese reports—including Dr. Quijano’s—were provided. The jury\nreturned a sentence of death. B Buck’s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. Buck v. State , No. 72,810 (Tex. Crim. App., Apr. 28,\n1999). His case then entered a labyrinth of state and federal\ncollateral review, where it has wandered for the better part of two\ndecades. Buck filed his first petition for a writ of habeas corpus in\nTexas state court in 1999. The four claims advanced in his\npetition, however, were all frivolous or noncognizable. See Ex parte Buck , No. 699684–A (Dist. Ct. Harris Cty.,\nTex., July 11, 2003), pp. 6–7. The petition failed to mention\ndefense counsel’s introduction of expert testimony that Buck’s race\nincreased his propensity for violence. But Dr. Quijano had testified in other cases, too, and in 1999,\nwhile Buck’s first habeas petition was pending, one of those cases\nreached this Court. The petitioner, Victor Hugo Saldano, argued\nthat his death sentence had been tainted by Dr. Quijano’s testimony\nthat Saldano’s Hispanic heritage “was a factor weighing in the\nfavor of future dangerousness.” App. 302a. Texas confessed error on\nthat ground and asked this Court to grant Saldano’s petition for\ncertiorari, vacate the state court judgment, and remand the case.\nIn June 2000, the Court did so. Saldano v. Texas ,530\nU. S. 1212. Within days, the Texas Attorney General, John Cornyn, issued a\npublic statement concerning the cases in which Dr. Quijano had\ntestified. The statement affirmed that “it is inappropriate to\nallow race to be considered as a factor in our criminal justice\nsystem.” App. 213a. In keeping with that principle, the Attorney\nGeneral explained that his office had conducted a “thorough audit”\nand “identified eight more cases in which testimony was offered by\nDr. Quijano that race should be a factor for the jury to consider\nin making its determination about the sentence in a capital murder\ntrial.” Ibid. Six of those cases were “similar to that of\nVictor Hugo Saldano”; in those cases, letters had been sent to\ncounsel apprising them of the Attorney General’s findings. Id., at 213a–214a. The statement closed by identifying the\ndefendants in those six cases. Buck was one of them. Id., at\n215a–217a. By the close of 2002, the Attorney General had confessed\nerror, waived any avail-able procedural defenses, and consented to\nresentencing in the cases of five of those six defendants. See Alba v. Johnson , 232 F. 3d 208 (CA5 2000) (Table);\nMemorandum and Order in Blue v. Johnson , No.\n4:99–cv–00350 (SD Tex.), pp. 15–17; Order in Garcia v. Johnson , No. 1:99–cv–00134 (ED Tex.), p. 1; Order in Broxton v. Johnson , No. 4:00–cv–01034 (SD Tex.), pp.\n10–11; Final Judgment in Gonzales v. Cockrell , No.\n7:99–cv–00072 (WD Tex.), p. 1. Not, however, in Buck’s. In 2002, Buck’s attorney filed a new\nstate habeas petition alleging that trial counsel had rendered\nineffective assistance by introducing Dr. Quijano’s testimony. The\nState was not represented by the Attorney General in this\nproceeding—the Texas Attorney General represents state respondents\nin federal habeas cases, but not state habeas cases—and it did not\nconfess error. Because Buck’s petition was successive, the Texas\nCourt of Criminal Appeals dismissed it as an abuse of the writ. Ex parte Buck , Nos. 57,004–01, 57,004–02 (Tex. Crim.\nApp., Oct. 15, 2003) ( per curiam ). Buck turned to the federal courts. He filed a petition for\nhabeas corpus under28 U. S. C. §2254 in October 2004, by\nwhich time Attorney General Cornyn had left office. See Buck v. Dretke , 2006 WL 8411481, *2 (SD Tex., July 24, 2006).\nBuck sought relief on the ground that trial counsel’s introduction\nof Dr. Quijano’s testimony was constitutionally ineffective. The\nState responded that the state court had dismissed Buck’s\nineffective assistance claim because Buck had failed to press it in\nhis first petition, raising it for the first time in a procedurally\nimproper second petition. The State argued that such reliance on an\nestablished state rule of procedure was an adequate and independent\nstate ground precluding federal review. Texas acknowledged that it\nhad waived similar procedural defenses in Saldano’s case. But it\nargued that Buck’s case was different because “[i]n Saldano’s case\nDr. Quijano testified for the State ”; in Buck’s, “it was\nBuck who called Dr. Quijano to testify.” Answer and Motion for\nSummary Judgment in No. 4:04–cv–03965 (SD Tex.), p. 20. Buck countered that, notwithstanding his procedural default, the\nDistrict Court should reach the merits of his claim because a\nfailure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice. Buck did\nnot argue that his default should be excused on a showing of\n“cause” and “prejudice”—that is, cause for the default, and\nprejudice from the denial of a federal right. And for good reason:\nAt the time Buck filed his §2254 petition, our decision in Coleman v. Thompson ,501 U. S. 722–753 (1991),\nmade clear that an attorney’s failure to raise an ineffective\nassistance claim during state postconviction review could not\nconstitute cause. The District Court rejected Buck’s miscarriage of\njustice argument and held that, because of his procedural default,\nhis ineffective assistance claim was unreviewable. Buck v. Dretke , 2006 WL 8411481, at *8. Buck unsuccessfully sought\nreview of the District Court’s ruling. See Buck v. Thaler , 345 Fed. Appx. 923 (CA5 2009) ( per\ncuriam ) (denying application for a COA), cert. denied,559\nU. S. 1072 (2010). In 2011, Buck sought to reopen his case, arguing that the\nprosecution had violated the Equal Protection and Due Process\nClauses by asking Dr. Quijano about the relationship between race\nand future violence on cross-examination and referring to his\ntestimony during summation. Buck also argued that the State’s\ndecision to treat him differently from the other defendants\naffected by Dr. Quijano’s testimony justified relieving him of the\nDistrict Court’s adverse judgment. The Fifth Circuit disagreed, see Buck v. Thaler , 452 Fed. Appx. 423, 427–428 (CA5\n2011) ( per curiam ), and we denied certiorari, Buck v. Thaler ,565 U. S. 1022 (2011). Buck,\nstill barred by Coleman from avoiding the consequences of\nhis procedural default, did not pursue his ineffective assistance\nclaim. C In 2012, this Court “modif[ied] the unqualified statement in Coleman that an attorney’s ignorance or inadvertence in a\npostconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a\nprocedural default.” Martinez , 566 U. S., at 9. We held\nthat when a state formally limits the adjudication of claims of\nineffective assistance of trial counsel to collateral review, a\nprisoner may establish cause for procedural default if (1) “the\nstate courts did not appoint counsel in the initial-review\ncollateral proceeding,” or “appointed counsel in [that] proceeding\n. . . was ineffective under the standards of Strickland v. Washington ,466 U. S. 668 (1984)”;\nand (2) “the underlying . . . claim is a substantial one,\nwhich is to say that . . . the claim has some merit.” Id., at 14. By its terms, Martinez did not bear on Buck’s ineffective\nassistance claim. At the time of Buck’s conviction and appeal,\nTexas did not formally require criminal defendants to reserve such\nclaims for collateral review. In Tre-vino , however, the\nCourt concluded that the exception an-nounced in Martinez extended to state systems that, as a practical matter, deny\ncriminal defendants “a meaningful opportunity” to press ineffective\nassistance claims on direct appeal. 569 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 13). The Court further concluded that the system in Texas,\nwhere petitioner had been convicted, was such a system. Ibid. The upshot: Had Martinez and Trevino been decided before Buck filed his §2254 petition, a federal court\ncould have reviewed Buck’s ineffective assistance claim if he\ndemonstrated that (1) state postconviction counsel had been\nconstitutionally ineffective in failing to raise it, and (2) the\nclaim had “some merit.” Martinez , 566 U. S., at 14. D When Trevino was decided, Buck’s third state habeas\npetition was pending in Texas court. That petition was denied in\nNovember 2013. Ex parte Buck , 418 S. W. 3d 98\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2013) ( per curiam ). Two months later,\nBuck returned to federal court, where he filed a motion to reopen\nhis §2254 case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6). Rule\n60(b) enumerates specific circumstances in which a party may be\nrelieved of the effect of a judgment, such as mistake, newly\ndiscovered evidence, fraud, and the like. The Rule concludes with a\ncatchall category—subdivision (b)(6)—providing that a court may\nlift a judgment for “any other reason that justifies relief.”\nRelief is available under subdivision (b)(6), however, only in\n“extraordinary circumstances,” and the Court has explained that\n“[s]uch circumstances will rarely occur in the habeas context.” Gonzalez , 545 U. S., at 535. In his motion, Buck identified 11 factors that, in his view,\njustified reopening the judgment. These included his attorney’s\nintroduction of expert testimony linking Buck’s race to violence,\nthe central issue at sentencing; the prosecution’s questions about\nrace and violence on cross-examination and reliance on Dr.\nQuijano’s testimony in summation; the State’s confession of error\nin other cases in which Dr. Quijano testified, but its refusal to\nconcede error in Buck’s case; and the change in law effected by Martinez and Trevino , which, if they had been decided\nearlier, would have permitted federal review of Buck’s defaulted\nclaim. App. 283a–285a. The District Court denied relief on two grounds. First, the\ncourt concluded that Buck had failed to demonstrate extraordinary\ncircumstances. To that end, the court observed that a change in\ndecisional law is rarely extraordinary by itself. Buck v. Stephens , 2014 WL 11310152, *4 (SD Tex., Aug. 29, 2014). It\nfurther determined that the State’s “promise” not to oppose\nresentencing did not count for much, reasoning that “Buck’s case is\ndifferent in critical respects from the cases in which Texas\nconfessed error” in that Buck’s lawyer, not the prosecutor, had\nfirst elicited the objectionable testimony. Id., at *4–*5.\nThe court also dismissed the contention that the nature of Dr.\nQuijano’s testimony argued for reopening the case. Although “the\nintroduction of any mention of race was,” in the court’s view,\n“ill[ ]advised at best and repugnant at worst,” it was also “ de\nminimis ”: Dr. Quijano had discussed the connection between race\nand violence only twice. Id., at *5. The court accordingly\nconcluded that Buck had failed to make out the predicate for Rule\n60(b)(6) relief. Second, the court determined that—even if the circumstances were extraordinary—Buck’s claim would fail on the merits.\nThe court noted that under Strickland , Buck was obliged to\nshow that counsel’s performance was both deficient and prejudicial.\nThe court held that Buck’s lawyer had indeed performed deficiently\nin calling Dr. Quijano to give testimony that “len[t] credence to\nany potential latent racial prejudice held by the jury.” 2014 WL\n11310152, at *6. But, the court concluded, Buck had failed to\ndemonstrate prejudice. It observed that Buck’s crime had been\n“horrific.” Ibid. And the court had already concluded that\n“the introduction of any mention of race was . . . de\nminimis .” Id., at *5. For those reasons, it held, Buck\nhad failed to show a reasonable probability that he would not have\nbeen sentenced to death but for Dr. Quijano’s testimony about race\nand violence. Buck sought to appeal the denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion. He\naccordingly filed an application for a COA with the Fifth Circuit.\nTo obtain a COA, Buck was required to make “a substantial showing\nof the denial of a constitutional right.”[ 1 ]*28\nU. S. C. §2253(c)(2). The Fifth Circuit denied a COA, concluding that Buck’s case was\n“not extraordinary at all in the habeas context.” Buck v. Stephens , 623 Fed. Appx. 668, 673 (2015). The panel agreed\nwith the District Court that Martinez and Trevino were not significant factors in the analysis. It characterized most\nof the other factors Buck had identified as “variations on the\nmerits” of his claim, which was “at least unremarkable as far as\n[ineffective assistance] claims go.” 623 Fed. Appx., at 673. The\npanel likewise rejected Buck’s argument that he was entitled to\nrelief because the State had issued a press release indicating that\nhis case would be treated like Saldano’s, and then had confessed\nerror in the other cases identified as similar in the statement,\nbut not in Buck’s. Id., at 674. Because Buck had “not shown\nextraordinary circumstances that would permit relief under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6),” the panel “den[ied] the\napplication for a COA.” Id., at 669. Buck’s motion for rehearing en banc was denied over two\ndissenting votes. Buck v. Stephens , 630 Fed. Appx.\n251 (CA5 2015) ( per curiam ). We granted certiorari. Buck v. Stephens , 578 U. S. ___ (2016). II A state prisoner whose petition for a writ of habeas corpus is\ndenied by a federal district court does not enjoy an absolute right\nto appeal. Federal law requires that he first obtain a COA from a\ncircuit justice or judge.28 U. S. C. §2253(c)(1). A COA\nmay issue “only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of\nthe denial of a constitutional right.” §2253(c)(2). Until the\nprisoner secures a COA, the Court of Appeals may not rule on the\nmerits of his case. Miller-El v. Cockrell ,537\nU. S. 322 (2003). The COA i",

    "fulltext": " SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES NORTH CAROLINA, et al., APPELLANTS v. SANDRA LITTLE COVINGTON, et al. on appeal from the united states district\ncourt for the middle district of north carolina No. 17–1364. Decided June 28, 2018 Per Curiam. This appeal arises from a remedial redistricting\norder entered by the District Court in a racial gerrymandering case\nwe have seen before. The case concerns the redistricting of state\nlegislative districts by the North Carolina General Assembly in\n2011, in response to the 2010 census. A group of plaintiff voters,\nappellees here, alleged that the General Assembly racially\ngerrymandered their districts when—in an ostensible effort to\ncomply with the requirements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965—it\ndrew 28 State Senate and State House of Representatives districts\ncomprising majorities of black voters. The District Court granted\njudgment to the plaintiffs, and we summarily affirmed that\njudgment. See Covington v. North Carolina , 316\nF. R. D. 117 (MDNC 2016), summarily aff’d, 581 U. S.\n___ (2017). At the same time, however, we vacated the\nDistrict Court’s remedial order, which directed the General\nAssembly to adopt new districting maps, shortened by one year the\nterms of the legislators currently serving in the gerrymandered\ndistricts, called for special elections in those districts, and\nsuspended two provisions of the North Carolina Constitution. See North Carolina v. Covington , 581 U. S. ___, ___\n(2017) ( per curiam ) (slip op., at 1–2). The District Court\nordered all of this, we noted, after undertaking only the “most\ncursory” review of the equitable balance involved in court-ordered\nspecial elections. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 3). Having\nfound that the District Court’s discretion “ ‘was barely\nexercised,’ ” we remanded the case for further remedial\nproceedings. Ibid. (quoting Winter v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc. , 555 U. S. 7, 27\n(2008)). On remand, the District Court ordered the\nGeneral Assembly to draw remedial maps for the State House and\nState Senate within a month, and to file those maps in the District\nCourt for approval. The General Assembly complied after directing\nits map drawers to, among other things, make “[r]easonable efforts\n. . . to avoid pairing incumbent members of the House\n[and] Senate” and not to use “[d]ata identifying the race of\nindividuals or voters” in the drawing of the new districts. 283\nF. Supp. 3d 410, 417–418 (MDNC 2018) ( per curiam ).\nThe plaintiffs filed objections to the new maps. They argued that\nfour legislative districts—Senate Districts 21 and 28 and House\nDistricts 21 and 57—still segregated voters on the basis of race.\nThe plaintiffs also objected to the General Assembly’s decision to\nredraw five State House districts situated in Wake and Mecklenburg\nCounties. They argued that those five districts “did not violate\nthe [U. S.] Constitution, [and] did not abut a district\nviolating the [U. S.] Constitution.” Id., at 443. Thus,\nthey contended, the revision of the borders of those districts\nconstituted mid-decade redistricting in violation of the North\nCarolina Constitution. See Art. II, §5(4); Granville County\nCommr’s v. Ballard , 69 N. C. 18, 20–21 (1873). After some consideration of these objections,\nthe District Court appointed a Special Master to redraw the lines\nof the districts to which the plaintiffs objected, along with any\nnonadjacent districts to the extent “necessary” to comply with\ndistricting criteria specified by the District Court. App. to\nJuris. Statement 106–107. Those criteria included adherence to the\n“county groupings” used by the legislature in its remedial plan and\nto North Carolina’s “Whole County Provision as interpreted by the\nNorth Carolina Supreme Court.” Id., at 108. The District\nCourt further instructed the Special Master to make “reasonable\nefforts to adhere to . . . state policy objectives” by\ncreating relatively compact districts and by avoiding split\nmunicipalities and precincts. Id., at 108–109. The District\nCourt also permitted the Special Master to “adjust district lines\nto avoid pairing any incumbents who have not publicly announced\ntheir intention not to run in 2018” and to “consider data\nidentifying the race of individuals or voters to the extent\nnecessary to ensure that his plan cures the unconstitutional racial\ngerrymanders.” Id., at 109–111. Upon receipt of the Special Master’s report, the\nDistrict Court sustained the plaintiffs’ objections and adopted the\nSpecial Master’s recommended reconfiguration of the state\nlegislative maps. See 283 F. Supp. 3d, at 414. With\nrespect to Senate Districts 21 and 28 and House Districts 21 and\n57, the District Court found that those districts, as redrawn by\nthe legislature, “retain[ed] the core shape” of districts that it\nhad earlier found to be unconstitutional. Id., at 436; see id., at 439, 440, 441–442. The District Court noted, for\ninstance, that the legislature’s remedial plan for Senate District\n21 copied the prior plan’s “horseshoe-shaped section of the city of\nFayetteville,” which “include[d] Fayetteville’s predominantly black\n[voting districts] and blocks and exclude[d] Fayetteville’s\npredominantly white [voting districts] and blocks.” Id., at\n436. Although the defendants explained that the new district was\ndesigned to “ ‘preserve the heart of Fayetteville,’ ” the\nDistrict Court found that they had “fail[ed] to provide any\nexplanation or evidence as to why ‘preserving the heart of\nFayetteville’ required the exclusion of numerous majority-white\nprecincts in downtown Fayetteville from the remedial district.” Ibid. (alterations omitted). Likewise, the District Court\nfound that the legislature’s remedial version of Senate District\n28, though it “encompasse[d] only a portion of [the city of]\nGreensboro,” nevertheless “encompasse[d] all of the majority\nblack [voting districts] within Greensboro,” while “exclud[ing]\npredominantly white sections of Greensboro,” and “reach[ing] out of\nGreensboro’s city limits to capture predominantly African-American\nareas in eastern Guilford County.” Id., at 438. By choosing\nto preserve the shape of the district’s “ ‘anchor’ ” in\neastern Greensboro, the District Court found, the General Assembly\nhad “ensured that the district would retain a high [black voting\nage population], thereby perpetuating the effects of the racial\ngerrymander.” Id., at 438–439. The District Court made similar findings with\nrespect to the legislature’s remedial House Districts 21 and 57.\nHouse District 21, it found, “(1) preserve[d] the core shape of\n. . . the previously unconstitutional district, (2)\ninclude[d] all but one of the majority-black [voting districts] in\nthe two counties through which it [ran], (3) divide[d] a\nmunicipality and precinct along racial lines, [and] (4) ha[d] an\nirregular shape that corresponde[d] to the racial make-up of the\ngeographic area.” Id., at 439–440. In light of this and\nother evidence, the District Court concluded that House District 21\n“continue[d] to be a racial gerrymander.” Id., at 440. House\nDistrict 57, the District Court found, likewise inexplicably\n“divide[d] the city of Greensboro along racial lines,” id., at 442, and otherwise preserved features of the previously\ninvalidated 2011 maps. The District Court thus concluded that the\nGeneral Assembly’s remedial plans as to those districts were\nunconstitutional. Ibid. The District Court then sustained the\nplaintiffs’ remaining objection that several House districts in\nWake and Mecklenburg Counties had been redrawn unnecessarily in\nviolation of the North Carolina Constitution’s prohibition on\nmid-decade redistricting. See id., at 443 (citing\nArt. II, §5(4)). The court reasoned that the prohibition\n“preclude[d] the General Assembly from engaging in mid-decade\nredistricting” except to the extent “required by federal law or a\njudicial order.” 283 F. Supp. 3d, at 443. It noted\nfurther that, “[w]hen a court must draw remedial districts itself,\nthis means that a court may redraw only those districts necessary\nto remedy the constitutional violation,” ibid. (citing Upham v. Seamon , 456 U. S. 37, 40–41 (1982)\n( per curiam )), and that “ Upham requires that a\nfederal district court’s remedial order not unnecessarily interfere\nwith state redistricting choices,” 283 F. Supp. 3d, at\n443. This remedial principle informed the District Court’s\nconclusion that “the General Assembly [had] exceeded its authority\nunder [the District Court’s remedial] order by disregarding the\nmid-decade redistricting prohibition,” since the legislature had\nfailed to “put forward any evidence showing that revising any of the five Wake and Mecklenburg County House districts\nchallenged by Plaintiffs was necessary to remedy the racially\ngerrymandered districts in those two counties.” Id., at\n444. Finally, the District Court adopted the Special\nMaster’s recommended replacement plans for the districts to which\nthe plaintiffs had objected. In adopting those recommendations, the\nDistrict Court turned away the defendants’ argument that they were\nbuilt on “specific . . . quota[s]” of black voters in\neach reconstituted district. Id., at 448–449. The District\nCourt instead credited the Special Master’s submission that his\n“ ‘remedial districts were drawn not with any racial target in\nmind, but in order to maximize compactness, preserve precinct\nboundaries, and respect political subdivision lines,’ ” and\nthat the remedial map was the product of “ ‘explicitly\nrace-neutral criteria.’ ” Id., at 449. The District\nCourt directed the defendants to implement the Special Master’s\nrecommended district lines and to conduct elections\naccordingly. The defendants applied to this Court for a stay\nof the District Court’s order pending appeal. We granted a stay\nwith respect to implementation of the Special Master’s remedial\ndistricts in Wake and Mecklenburg Counties, but otherwise denied\nthe application. See 583 U. S. ___ (2018). The defendants\ntimely appealed directly to this Court as provided under 28\nU. S. C. §1253. We have jurisdiction, and now summarily\naffirm in part and reverse in part the order of the District\nCourt. *  *  * The defendants first argue that the District\nCourt lacked jurisdiction even to enter a remedial order in this\ncase. In their view, “[w]here, as here, a lawsuit challenges the\nvalidity of a statute,” the case becomes moot “when the statute is\nrepealed.” Juris. Statement 17. Thus, according to the defendants,\nthe plaintiffs’ racial gerrymandering claims ceased to exist when\nthe North Carolina General Assembly enacted remedial plans for the\nState House and State Senate and repealed the old plans. The defendants misunderstand the nature of the\nplaintiffs’ claims. Those claims, like other racial gerrymandering\nclaims, arise from the plaintiffs’ allegations that they have been\n“separate[d] . . . into different districts on the basis\nof race.” Shaw v. Reno , 509 U. S. 630, 649\n(1993). Resolution of such claims will usually turn upon\n“circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other\ndistricting principles, was the legislature’s dominant and\ncontrolling rationale in drawing” the lines of legislative\ndistricts. Miller v. Johnson , 515 U. S. 900, 913\n(1995). But it is the segregation of the plaintiffs—not the\nlegislature’s line-drawing as such—that gives rise to their claims.\nIt is for this reason, among others, that the plaintiffs have\nstanding to challenge racial gerrymanders only with respect to\nthose legislative districts in which they reside. See Alabama\nLegislative Black Caucus v. Alabama , 575 U. S. ___,\n___ (2015) (slip op., at 6). Here, in the remedial posture in which\nthis case is presented, the plaintiffs’ claims that they were\norganized into legislative districts on the basis of their race did\nnot become moot simply because the General Assembly drew new\ndistrict lines around them. To the contrary, they argued in the\nDistrict Court that some of the new districts were mere\ncontinuations of the old, gerrymandered districts. Because the\nplaintiffs asserted that they remained segre- gated on the basis of\nrace, their claims remained the subject of a live dispute, and the\nDistrict Court properly retained jurisdiction. Second, the defendants argue that the District\nCourt erred when it “conclu[ded] that the General Assembly engaged\nin racial gerrymandering by declining to consider race.” Juris.\nStatement 20. They assert that “there is no dispute that the\nGeneral Assembly did not consider race at all when\ndesigning the 2017 [remedial plans]—not as a predominant motive, a\nsecondary motive, or otherwise,” and that such “undisputed fact\nshould have been the end of the plaintiffs’ racial gerrymandering\nchallenges.” Id., at 21–22. This argument suffers from the same conceptual\nflaws as the first. While it may be undisputed that the 2017\nlegislature instructed its map drawers not to look at race when\ncrafting a remedial map, what is also undisputed—because the\ndefendants do not attempt to rebut it in their jurisdictional\nstatement or in their brief opposing the plaintiffs’ motion to\naffirm—is the District Court’s detailed, district-by-district\nfactfinding respecting the legislature’s remedial Senate Districts\n21 and 28 and House Districts 21 and 57. That factfinding, as discussed above, turned up\nsufficient circumstantial evidence that race was the predominant\nfactor governing the shape of those four districts. See, e.g., 283 F. Supp. 3d, at 436. As this Court has\npreviously explained, a plaintiff can rely upon either\n“circumstantial evidence of a district’s shape and demographics or\nmore direct evidence going to legislative purpose” in proving a\nracial gerrymandering claim. Miller , supra, at 916.\nThe defendants’ insistence that the 2017 legislature did not look\nat racial data in drawing remedial districts does little to\nundermine the District Court’s conclusion—based on evidence\nconcerning the shape and demographics of those districts—that the\ndistricts unconstitutionally sort voters on the basis of race. 283\nF. Supp. 3d, at 442. Third, the defendants argue that the District\nCourt abused its discretion by arranging for the Special Master to\ndraw up an alternative remedial map instead of giving the General\nAssembly—which “stood ready and willing to promptly carry out its\nsovereign duty”—another chance at a remedial map. Juris. Statement\n33. Yet the District Court had its own duty to cure illegally\ngerrymandered districts through an orderly process in advance of\nelections. See Purcell v. Gonzalez , 549 U. S. 1,\n4–5 (2006) ( per curiam ). Here the District Court determined\nthat “providing the General Assembly with a second bite at the\napple” risked “further draw[ing] out these proceedings and\npotentially interfer[ing] with the 2018 election cycle.” 283\nF. Supp. 3d, at 448, n. 10. We conclude that the\nDistrict Court’s appointment of a Special Master in this case was\nnot an abuse of discretion. Neither was the District Court’s decision to\nadopt the Special Master’s recommended remedy for the racially\ngerrymandered districts. The defendants argue briefly that the\nDistrict Court’s adoption of that recommendation was error because\nthe Special Master’s remedial plan was “expressly race-conscious”\nand succeeded in “compel[ling] the State to employ racial quotas of\nplaintiffs’ choosing.” Juris. Statement 34–35. Yet this Court has\nlong recognized “[t]he distinction between being aware of racial\nconsiderations and being motivated by them.” Miller , supra , at 916. The District Court’s allowance that the\nSpecial Master could “consider data identifying the race of\nindividuals or voters to the extent necessary to ensure that his\nplan cures the unconstitutional racial gerrymanders,” App. to\nJuris. Statement 111, does not amount to a warrant for “racial\nquotas.” In any event, the defendants’ assertions on this question\nmake no real attempt to counter the District Court’s agreement with\nthe Special Master that “ ‘no racial targets were sought or\nachieved’ ” in drawing the remedial districts. 283\nF. Supp. 3d, at 449. All of the foregoing is enough to convince us\nthat the District Court’s order should be affirmed insofar as it\nprovided a court-drawn remedy for Senate Districts 21 and 28 and\nHouse Districts 21 and 57. The same cannot be said, however, of the\nDistrict Court’s actions concerning the legislature’s redrawing of\nHouse districts in Wake and Mecklenburg Counties. There the\nDistrict Court proceeded from a mistaken view of its adjudicative\nrole and its relationship to the North Carolina General\nAssembly. The only injuries the plaintiffs established in\nthis case were that they had been placed in their legislative\ndistricts on the basis of race. The District Court’s remedial\nauthority was accordingly limited to ensuring that the plaintiffs\nwere relieved of the burden of voting in racially gerrymandered\nlegislative districts. See DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno , 547 U. S. 332, 353 (2006). But the District\nCourt’s revision of the House districts in Wake and Mecklenburg\nCounties had nothing to do with that. Instead, the District Court\nredrew those districts because it found that the legislature’s\nrevision of them violated the North Carolina Constitution’s ban on\nmid-decade redistricting, not federal law. Indeed, the District\nCourt understood that ban to apply unless such redistricting was\n“required by federal law or judicial order.” 283\nF. Supp. 3d, at 443. The District Court’s enforcement of\nthe ban was thus premised on the conclusion that the General\nAssembly’s action was not “required” by federal law. The District Court’s decision to override the\nlegislature’s remedial map on that basis was clear error. “[S]tate\nlegislatures have primary jurisdiction over legislative\nreapportionment,” White v. Weiser , 412 U. S.\n783, 795 (1973) (internal quotation marks omitted), and a\nlegislature’s “freedom of choice to devise substitutes for an\napportionment plan found unconstitutional, either as a whole or in\npart, should not be restricted beyond the clear commands” of\nfederal law, Burns v. Richardson , 384 U. S. 73,\n85 (1966). A district court is “not free . . . to\ndisregard the political program of” a state legislature on other\nbases. Upham , 456 U. S., at 43. Once the District Court\nhad ensured that the racial gerrymanders at issue in this case were\nremedied, its proper role in North Carolina’s legislative\ndistricting process was at an end. The order of the District Court is affirmed in\npart and reversed in part. It is so ordered.",

Melin certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eighth circuit No. 16–1432. Argued March 19, 2018—Decided\nJune 11, 2018 The legal system has long used default rules\nto resolve estate litigation in a way that conforms to decedents’\npresumed intent. In 2002, Minnesota enacted a statute establishing\none such default rule. The statute provides that “the dissolution\nor annulment of a marriage revokes any revocable . . .\nbeneficiary designation . . . made by an individual to\nthe individual’s former spouse.” Minn. Stat. §524.2–804, subd. 1.\nUnder the statute, if one spouse has made the other the beneficiary\nof a life insurance policy or similar asset, their divorce\nautomatically revokes that designation so that the insurance\nproceeds will instead go to the contingent beneficiary or the\npolicyholder’s estate upon his death. The law does this on the\ntheory that the policyholder would want that result. But if he does\nnot, he may rename the ex-spouse as beneficiary. Mark Sveen and respondent Kaye Melin were\nmarried in 1997. The next year, Sveen purchased a life insurance\npolicy, naming Melin as the primary beneficiary and designating his\ntwo children from a prior marriage, petitioners Ashley and Antone\nSveen, as contingent beneficiaries. The Sveen-Melin marriage ended\nin 2007, but the divorce decree made no mention of the insurance\npolicy and Sveen took no action to revise his beneficiary\ndesignations. After Sveen passed away in 2011, Melin and the Sveen\nchildren made competing claims to the insurance proceeds. The\nSveens argued that under Minnesota’s revocation-on-divorce law,\ntheir father’s divorce canceled Melin’s beneficiary designation,\nleaving them as the rightful recipients. Melin claimed that because\nthe law did not exist when the policy was purchased and she was\nnamed as the primary beneficiary, applying the later-enacted law to\nthe policy violates the Constitution’s Contracts Clause. The\nDistrict Court awarded the insurance money to the Sveens, but the\nEighth Circuit reversed, holding that the retroactive application\nof Minnesota’s law violates the Contracts Clause. Held : The retroactive application\nof Minnesota’s statute does not violate the Contracts Clause. That\nClause restricts the power of States to disrupt contractual\narrangements, but it does not prohibit all laws affecting\npre-existing contracts, see El Paso v. Simmons, 379\nU. S. 497, 506–507. The two-step test for determining when\nsuch a law crosses the constitutional line first asks whether the\nstate law has “operated as a substantial impairment of a\ncontractual relationship.” Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, 438 U. S. 234, 244. In answering that\nquestion, the Court has considered the extent to which the law\nundermines the contractual bargain, interferes with a party’s\nreasonable expectations, and prevents the party from safeguarding\nor reinstating his rights. See id., at 246; El Paso ,\n379 U. S., at 514–515; Texaco, Inc. v. Short, 454 U. S. 516, 531. If such factors show a substantial\nimpairment, the inquiry turns to whether the state law is drawn in\nan “appropriate” and “reasonable” way to advance “a significant and\nlegitimate public purpose.” Energy Reserves Group, Inc. v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 459 U. S. 400,\n411–412. The Court stops after the first step here,\nbecause three aspects of Minnesota’s law, taken together, show that\nthe law does not substantially impair pre-existing contractual\narrangements. First, the law is designed to reflect a\npolicyholder’s intent—and so to support, rather than impair, the\ncontractual scheme. It applies a prevalent legislative presumption\nthat a divorcee would not want his former partner to benefit from\nhis life insurance policy and other will substitutes. Thus the law\noften honors, not undermines, the intent of the only contracting\nparty to care about the beneficiary term. Second, the law is\nunlikely to disturb any policyholder’s expectations at the time of\ncontracting, because an insured cannot reasonably rely on a\nbeneficiary designation staying in place after a divorce. Divorce\ncourts have wide discretion to divide property upon dissolution of\na marriage, including by revoking spousal beneficiary designations\nin life insurance policies or by mandating that such designations\nremain. Because a life insurance purchaser cannot know what will\nhappen to that policy in the event of a divorce, his reliance\ninterests are next to nil. And that fact cuts against providing\nprotection under the Contracts Clause. Last, the law supplies a\nmere default rule, which the policyholder can undo in a moment. If\nthe law’s presumption about what an insured wants after divorcing\nis wrong, the insured may overthrow it simply by sending a\nchange-of-beneficiary form to his insurer. This Court has long held that laws imposing\nsuch minimal paperwork burdens do not violate the Contracts Clause.\nIt has repeatedly sustained so-called recording statutes, which\nextinguish contractual interests unless timely recorded at\ngovernment offices. See Jackson v. Lamphire , 3 Pet.\n280; Vance v. Vance, 108 U. S. 514; Texaco,\nInc. v. Short, 454 U. S. 516. The Court has also\nupheld laws mandating other kinds of notifications or filings\nagainst Contracts Clause attack. See Curtis v. Whitney, 13 Wall. 68; Gilfillan v. Union Canal Co.\nof Pa., 109 U. S. 401; Conley v. Barton, 260\nU. S. 677. The Minnesota law places no greater obligation on a\ncontracting party than these laws—while imposing a lesser penalty\nfor noncompliance. Filing a change-of-beneficiary form is as easy\nas satisfying the paperwork requirements that this Court’s prior\ncases approved. And if an insured wants his ex-spouse to stay as\nbeneficiary but does not send in his form, the result is only that\nthe insurance money is redirected to his contingent beneficiaries,\nnot that his contractual rights are extinguished.\nPp. 6–14. 853 F. 3d 410, reversed and remanded. Kagan, J., delivered the opinion of the Court,\nin which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg,\nBreyer, Alito, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined. Gorsuch, J., filed a\ndissenting opinion.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 16–1432 _________________ ASHLEY SVEEN, et al., PETITIONERS v. KAYE MELIN on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eighth circuit [June 11, 2018] Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. A Minnesota law provides that “the dissolution\nor annulment of a marriage revokes any revocable[ ]\nbeneficiary designation[ ] made by an individual to the\nindividual’s former spouse.” Minn. Stat. §524.2–804, subd. 1\n(2016). That statute establishes a default rule for use when\nMinnesotans divorce. If one spouse has made the other the\nbeneficiary of a life insurance policy or similar asset, their\ndivorce automatically revokes that designation—on the theory that\nthe policyholder would want that result. But if he does not, the\npolicyholder may rename the ex-spouse as beneficiary. We consider here whether applying Minnesota’s\nautomatic-revocation rule to a beneficiary designation made before\nthe statute’s enactment violates the Contracts Clause of the\nConstitution. We hold it does not. I All good trust-and-estate lawyers know that\n“[d]eath is not the end; there remains the litigation over the\nestate.” 8 The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce 365 (1911). That\nepigram, beyond presaging this case, helps explain the statute at\nits center. The legal system has long used default rules to\nresolve estate litigation in a way that conforms to decedents’\npresumed intent. At common law, for example, marriage automatically\nrevoked a woman’s prior will, while marriage and the birth\nof a child revoked a man’s. See 4 J. Kent, Commentaries on American\nLaw 507, 512 (1830). The testator could then revive the old will or\nexecute a new one. But if he (or she) did neither, the laws of\nintestate succession (generally prioritizing children and current\nspouses) would control the estate’s distribution. See 95\nC. J. S., Wills §448, pp. 409–410 (2011); R. Sitkoff\n& J. Dukeminier, Wills, Trusts, and Estates 63 (10th ed. 2017).\nCourts reasoned that the average person would prefer that\nallocation to the one in the old will, given the intervening life\nevents. See T. Atkinson, Handbook of the Law of Wills 423 (2d ed.\n1953). If he’d only had the time, the thought went, he would have\nreplaced that will himself. Changes in society brought about changes in the\nlaws governing revocation of wills. In addition to removing gender\ndistinctions, most States abandoned the common-law rule canceling\nwhole wills executed before a marriage or birth. In its place, they\nenacted statutes giving a new spouse or child a specified share of\nthe decedent’s estate while leaving the rest of his will intact.\nSee Sitkoff & Dukeminier, Wills, Trusts, and Estates, at 240.\nBut more important for our purposes, climbing divorce rates led\nalmost all States by the 1980s to adopt another kind of\nautomatic-revocation law. So-called revocation-on-divorce statutes\ntreat an individual’s divorce as voiding a testamentary bequest to\na former spouse. Like the old common-law rule, those laws rest on a\n“judgment about the typical testator’s probable intent.” Id., at 239. They presume, in other words, that the average\nJoe does not want his ex inheriting what he leaves behind. Over time, many States extended their\nrevocation-on-divorce statutes from wills to “will substitutes,”\nsuch as revocable trusts, pension accounts, and life insurance\npolicies. See Langbein, The Nonprobate Revolution and the Future of\nthe Law of Succession, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1108, 1109 (1984)\n(describing nonprobate assets). In doing so, States followed the\nlead of the Uniform Probate Code, a model statute amended in 1990\nto include a provision revoking on divorce not just testamentary\nbequests but also beneficiary designations to a former spouse. See\n§§2–804(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U. L. A. 330, 330–331 (2013).\nThe new section, the drafters wrote, aimed to “unify the law of\nprobate and nonprobate transfers.” §2–804, Comment, id ., at\n333. The underlying idea was that the typical decedent would no\nmore want his former spouse to benefit from his pension plan or\nlife insurance than to inherit under his will. A wealth transfer\nwas a wealth transfer—and a former spouse (as compared with, say, a\ncurrent spouse or child) was not likely to be its desired\nrecipient. So a decedent’s failure to change his beneficiary\nprobably resulted from “inattention,” not “intention.” Statement of\nthe Joint Editorial Bd. for Uniform Probate Code, 17 Am. College\nTrust & Est. Counsel 184 (1991). Agreeing with that assumption,\n26 States have by now adopted revocation-on-divorce laws\nsubstantially similar to the Code’s.[ 1 ] Minnesota is one. Under prior Minnesota law, a divorce alone did\nnot affect a beneficiary designation—but a particular divorce\ndecree could do so. Take first the simple case: Joe names his wife\nAnn as beneficiary of his insurance policy, later gets divorced,\nbut never changes the designation. Upon his death, Ann would\nreceive the insurance proceeds—even if Joe had just forgotten to\nredirect the money. In other words, the insurance contract’s\nbeneficiary provision would govern after the divorce, exactly as it\nwould have before. See Larsen v. Northwestern Nat. Life\nIns. Co. , 463 N. W. 2d 777, 779 (Minn. App. 1990). But now\nintroduce a complication, in the form of a court addressing a\nspousal designation in a divorce decree. In Minnesota, as across\nthe nation, divorce courts have always had “broad discretion in\ndividing property upon dissolution of a marriage.” Maurer v. Maurer , 623 N. W. 2d 604, 606 (Minn. 2001); see 24 Am.\nJur. 2d, Divorce and Separation §456 (2008). In exercising that\npower, a court could revoke a beneficiary designation to a\nsoon-to-be ex-spouse; or conversely, a court could mandate that the\nold designation remain. See, e.g., Paul v. Paul , 410 N. W. 2d 329, 330 (Minn. App. 1987); O’Brien v. O’Brien , 343 N. W. 2d 850, 853 (Minn.\n1984). Either way, the court, rather than the insured, would decide\nwhether the ex-spouse would stay the beneficiary. In contrast to the old law, Minnesota’s new\nrevocation-on-divorce statute starts from another baseline: the\ncancellation, rather than continuation, of a beneficiary\ndesignation. Enacted in 2002 to track the Code, the law provides\nthat “the dissolution or annulment of a marriage revokes any\nrevocable[ ] disposition, beneficiary designation, or\nappointment of property made by an individual to the individual’s\nformer spouse in a governing instrument.” Minn. Stat. §524.2–804,\nsubd. 1. The term “governing instrument” is defined to include an\n“insurance or annuity policy,” along with a will and other will\nsubstitutes. §524.1–201. So now when Joe and Ann divorce, the\nclause naming Ann as Joe’s insurance beneficiary is automatically\nrevoked. If nothing else occurs before Joe’s death, his insurance\nproceeds go to any contingent beneficiary named in the policy\n(perhaps his daughter Emma) or, failing that, to his estate. See\n§524.2–804, subd. 2. Something else, however, may well happen. As\nunder Minnesota’s former law, a divorce decree may alter the\nnatural state of things. So in our example, the court could direct\nthat Ann remain as Joe’s insurance beneficiary, despite the normal\nrevocation rule. See §524.2–804, subd. 1 (providing that a “court\norder” trumps the rule). And just as important, the policyholder\nhimself may step in to override the revocation. Joe, for example,\ncould agree to a marital settlement ensuring Ann’s continued status\nas his beneficiary. See ibid. (providing that such an\nagreement controls). Or else, and more simply, he could notify his\ninsurance company at any time that he wishes to restore Ann to that\nposition. But enough of our hypothetical divorcees: It is\ntime they give way to Mark Sveen and Kaye Melin, whose marriage and\ndivorce led to this case. In 1997, Sveen and Melin wed. The next\nyear, Sveen purchased a life insurance policy. He named Melin as\nthe primary beneficiary, while designating his two children from a\nprior marriage, Ashley and Antone Sveen, as the contingent\nbeneficiaries. The Sveen-Melin marriage ended in 2007. The divorce\ndecree made no mention of the insurance policy. And Sveen took no\naction, then or later, to revise his beneficiary designations. In\n2011, he passed away. In this action, petitioners the Sveen children\nand respondent Melin make competing claims to the insurance\nproceeds. The Sveens contend that under Minnesota’s\nrevocation-on-divorce law, their father’s divorce canceled Melin’s\nbeneficiary designation and left the two of them as the rightful\nrecipients. Melin notes in reply that the Minnesota law did not yet\nexist when her former husband bought his insurance policy and named\nher as the primary beneficiary. And she argues that applying the\nlater-enacted law to the policy would violate the Constitution’s\nContracts Clause, which prohibits any state “Law impairing the\nObligation of Contracts.” Art. I, §10, cl. 1. The District Court rejected Melin’s argument and\nawarded the insurance money to the Sveens. See Civ. No. 14–5015 (D\nMinn., Jan. 7, 2016), App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a–16a. But the Court\nof Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed. It held that a\n“revocation-upon-divorce statute like [Minnesota’s] violates the\nContract Clause when applied retroactively.” 853 F. 3d 410,\n412 (2017). We granted certiorari, 583 U. S. ___\n(2017), to resolve a split of authority over whether the Contracts\nClause prevents a revocation-on-divorce law from applying to a\npre-existing agreement’s beneficiary designation.[ 2 ] We now reverse the decision below. II The Contracts Clause restricts the power of\nStates to disrupt contractual arrangements. It provides that “[n]o\nstate shall . . . pass any . . . Law impairing\nthe Obligation of Contracts.” U. S. Const., Art. I, §10,\ncl. 1. The origins of the Clause lie in legislation enacted after\nthe Revolutionary War to relieve debtors of their obligations to\ncreditors. See Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis , 480 U. S. 470, 502–503 (1987). But the\nClause applies to any kind of contract. See Allied Structural\nSteel Co. v. Spannaus , 438 U. S. 234, 244–245, n.\n16 (1978). That includes, as here, an insurance policy. At the same time, not all laws affecting\npre-existing contracts violate the Clause. See El Paso v. Simmons , 379 U. S. 497, 506–507 (1965). To determine\nwhen such a law crosses the constitutional line, this Court has\nlong applied a two-step test. The threshold issue is whether the\nstate law has “operated as a substantial impairment of a\ncontractual relationship.” Allied Structural Steel Co. , 438\nU. S., at 244. In answering that question, the Court has\nconsidered the extent to which the law undermines the contractual\nbargain, interferes with a party’s reasonable expectations, and\nprevents the party from safeguarding or reinstating his rights. See id., at 246; El Paso , 379 U. S., at 514–515; Texaco, Inc. v. Short , 454 U. S. 516, 531\n(1982). If such factors show a substantial impairment, the inquiry\nturns to the means and ends of the legislation. In particular, the\nCourt has asked whether the state law is drawn in an “appropriate”\nand “reasonable” way to advance “a significant and legitimate\npublic purpose.” Energy Reserves Group, Inc. v. Kansas\nPower & Light Co. , 459 U. S. 400, 411–412 (1983). Here, we may stop after step one because\nMinnesota’s revocation-on-divorce statute does not substantially\nimpair pre-existing contractual arrangements. True enough that in\nrevoking a beneficiary designation, the law makes a significant\nchange. As Melin says, the “whole point” of buying life insurance\nis to provide the proceeds to the named beneficiary. Brief for\nRespondent 16. But three aspects of Minnesota’s law, taken\ntogether, defeat Melin’s argument that the change it effected\n“severely impaired” her ex-husband’s contract. Ibid . First,\nthe statute is designed to reflect a policyholder’s intent—and so\nto support, rather than impair, the contractual scheme. Second, the\nlaw is unlikely to disturb any policyholder’s expectations because\nit does no more than a divorce court could always have done. And\nthird, the statute supplies a mere default rule, which the\npolicyholder can undo in a moment. Indeed, Minnesota’s revocation\nstatute stacks up well against laws that this Court upheld against\nContracts Clause challenges as far back as the early\n1800s.[ 3 ] We now consider in\ndetail each of the features that make this so. To begin, the Minnesota statute furthers the\npolicyholder’s intent in many cases—indeed, the drafters reasonably\nthought in the typical one. As earlier described, legislatures have\nlong made judgments about a decedent’s likely testamentary intent\nafter large life changes—a marriage, a birth, or a divorce. See supra, at 2. And on that basis, they have long enacted\nstatutes revoking earlier-made wills by operation of law.\nLegislative presumptions about divorce are now especially\nprevalent—probably because they accurately reflect the intent of\nmost divorcing parties. Although there are exceptions, most\ndivorcees do not aspire to enrich their former partners. (And that\nis true even when an ex-spouse has custody of shared children,\ngiven the many ways to provide them with independent support.) The\nMinnesota statute (like the model code it tracked) applies that\nunderstanding to beneficiary designations in life insurance\npolicies and other will substitutes. See supra, at 3–5.\nMelin rightly notes that this extension raises a brand-new\nconstitutional question because “an insurance policy is a contract\nunder the Contracts Clause, and a will is not.” Brief for\nRespondent 44 (internal quotation marks omitted). But in answering\nthat question, it matters that the old legislative presumption\nequally fits the new context: A person would as little want his\nex-spouse to benefit from his insurance as to collect under his\nwill. Or said otherwise, the insured’s failure to change the\nbeneficiary after a divorce is more likely the result of neglect\nthan choice. And that means the Minnesota statute often honors, not\nundermines, the intent of the only contracting party to care about\nthe beneficiary term. The law no doubt changes how the insurance\ncontract operates. But does it impair the contract? Quite the\nopposite for lots of policyholders. And even when presumed and actual intent\ndiverge, the Minnesota law is unlikely to upset a policyholder’s\nexpectations at the time of contracting. That is because an insured\ncannot reasonably rely on a beneficiary designation remaining in\nplace after a divorce. As noted above, divorce courts have wide\ndiscretion to divide property between spouses when a marriage ends.\nSee supra, at 4. The house, the cars, the sporting equipment\nare all up for grabs. See Judgment and Decree in 14–cv–5015 (D\nMinn.), p. 51 (awarding Melin, among other things, a snowmobile and\nall-terrain vehicle). And (what matters here) so too are the\nspouses’ life insurance policies, with their beneficiary\nprovisions. Although not part of the Sveen-Melin divorce decree,\nthey could have been; as Melin acknowledges, they sometimes are.\nSee supra, at 4; Brief for Respondent 38. Melin counters\nthat the Contracts Clause applies only to legislation, not to\njudicial decisions. See id., at 38–39; see also post ,\nat 9 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting). That is true, but of no moment. The\npower of divorce courts over insurance policies is relevant here\nbecause it affects whether a party can reasonably expect a\nbeneficiary designation to survive a marital breakdown. We venture\nto guess that few people, when purchasing life insurance, give a\nthought to what will happen in the event of divorce. But even if\nsomeone out there does, he can conclude only that . . .\nhe cannot possibly know. So his reliance interests are next to nil.\nAnd as this Court has held before, that fact cuts against providing\nprotection under the Contracts Clause. See, e.g., El\nPaso , 379 U. S., at 514–515. Finally, a policyholder can reverse the effect\nof the Minnesota statute with the stroke of a pen. The law puts in\nplace a presumption about what an insured wants after divorcing.\nBut if the presumption is wrong, the insured may overthrow it. And\nhe may do so by the simple act of sending a change-of-beneficiary\nform to his insurer. (Or if he wants to commit himself forever,\nlike Ulysses binding himself to the mast, he may agree to a divorce\nsettlement continuing his ex-spouse’s beneficiary status. See supra , at 5.) That action restores his former spouse to the\nposition she held before the divorce—and in so doing, cancels the\nstate law’s operation. The statute thus reduces to a paperwork\nrequirement (and a fairly painless one, at that): File a form and\nthe statutory default rule gives way to the original beneficiary\ndesignation. In cases going back to the 1800s, this Court has\nheld that laws imposing such minimal paperwork burdens do not\nviolate the Contracts Clause. One set of decisions addresses\nso-called recording statutes, which extinguish contractual\ninterests unless timely recorded at government offices. In Jackson v. Lamphire , 3 Pet. 280 (1830), for example,\nthe Court rejected a Contracts Clause challenge to a New York law\ngranting title in property to a later rather than earlier purchaser\nwhenever the earlier had failed to record his deed. It made no\ndifference, the Court held, whether the unrecorded deed was “dated\nbefore or after the passage” of the statute; in neither event did\nthe law’s modest recording condition “impair[ ] the obligation\nof contracts.” Id., at 290. Likewise, in Vance v. Vance , 108 U. S. 514 (1883), the Court upheld a statute\nrendering unrecorded mortgages unenforceable against third\nparties—even when the mortgages predated the law. We reasoned that\nthe law gave “due regard to existing contracts” because it demanded\nonly that the mortgagee make a “public registration,” and gave him\nseveral months to do so. Id., at 517, 518. And more\nrecently, in Texaco, Inc. v. Short , 454 U. S.\n516 (1982), the Court held that a statute terminating pre-existing\nmineral interests unless the owner filed a “statement of claim” in\na county office did not “unconstitutionally impair” a contract. Id., at 531. The filing requirement was “minimal,” we\nexplained, and compliance with it would effectively “safeguard any\ncontractual obligations or rights.” Ibid. So too, the Court has long upheld against\nContracts Clause attack laws mandating other kinds of notifications\nor filings. In Curtis v. Whitney , 13 Wall. 68 (1872),\nfor example, the Court approved a statute retroactively affecting\nbuyers of “certificates” for land offered at tax sales. The law\nrequired the buyer to notify the tax-delinquent property owner, who\ncould then put up the funds necessary to prevent the land’s final\nsale. If the buyer failed to give the notice, he could not take the\nland—and if he provided the notice, his chance of gaining the land\ndeclined. Still, the Court made short work of the Contracts Clause\nclaim. Not “every statute which affects the value of a contract,”\nthe Court stated, “impair[s] its obligation.” Id., at 70.\nBecause the law’s notice rule was “easy [to] compl[y] with,” it did\nnot raise a constitutional problem. Id., at 71. Similarly,\nin Gilfillan v. Union Canal Co. of Pa. , 109\nU. S. 401 (1883), the Court sustained a state law providing\nthat an existing bondholder’s failure to reject a settlement\nproposal in writing would count as consent to the deal. The law\noperated to reduce the interest received by an investor who did not\nrespond. Yet the Court rebuffed the ensuing Contracts Clause suit.\n“If [the bondholder did] not wish to abandon his old rights and\naccept the new,” the Court explained, “all he ha[d] to do [was] to\nsay so in writing.” Id., at 406. And one last: In Conley v. Barton , 260 U. S. 677 (1923), the\nCourt held that the Contracts Clause did not bar a State from\ncompelling existing mortgagees to complete affidavits before\nfinally foreclosing on properties. The law effectively added a\npaperwork requirement to the mortgage contracts’ foreclosure terms.\nBut the Court said it was “only [a] condition, easily complied\nwith, which the law, for its purposes, requires.” Id., at\n681. The Minnesota statute places no greater\nobligation on a contracting party—while imposing a lesser penalty\nfor noncompliance. Even supposing an insured wants his life\ninsurance to benefit his ex-spouse, filing a change-of-beneficiary\nform with an insurance company is as “easy” as, say, providing a\nlandowner with notice or recording a deed. Curtis , 13 Wall.,\nat 71. Here too, with only “minimal” effort, a person can\n“safeguard” his contractual preferences. Texaco , 454\nU. S., at 531. And here too, if he does not “wish to abandon\nhis old rights and accept the new,” he need only “say so in\nwriting.” Gilfillan, 109 U. S., at 406. What’s more, if\nthe worst happens—if he wants his ex-spouse to stay as beneficiary\nbut does not send in his form—the consequence pales in comparison\nwith the losses incurred in our earlier cases. When a person\nignored a recording obligation, for example, he could forfeit the\nsum total of his contractual rights—just ask the plaintiffs in Jackson and Vance. But when a policyholder in\nMinnesota does not redesignate his ex-spouse as beneficiary, his\nright to insurance does not lapse; the upshot is just that his\ncontingent beneficiaries (here, his children) receive the money.\nSee supra, at 5. That redirection of proceeds is not\nnothing; but under our precedents, it gives the policyholder—who,\nagain, could have “easily” and entirely escaped the law’s effect—no\nright to complain of a Contracts Clause violation. Conley ,\n260 U. S., at 681. In addressing those precedents, Melin mainly\nurges us to distinguish between two ways a law can affect a\ncontract. The Minnesota law, Melin claims, “operate[s] on the\ncontract itself” by “directly chang[ing] an express term” (the\ninsured’s beneficiary designation). Brief for Respondent 51; Tr. of\nOral Arg. 57. In contrast, Melin continues, the recording statutes\n“impose[ ] a consequence” for failing to abide by a\n“procedural” obligation extraneous to the agreement (the State’s\nrecording or notification rule). Brief for Respondent 51; Tr. of\nOral Arg. 58. The difference, in her view, parallels the line\nbetween rights and remedies: The Minnesota law explicitly alters a\nperson’s entitlement under the contract, while the recording laws\ninterfere with his ability to enforce that entitlement against\nothers. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 57–59; see also post , at 9–10\n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting). But we see no meaningful distinction among all\nthese laws. The old statutes also “act[ed] on the contract” in a\nsignificant way. Tr. of Oral Arg. 59. They added a paperwork\nobligation nowhere found in the original agreement—“record the\ndeed,” say, or “notify the landowner.” And they informed a\ncontracting party that unless he complied, he could not gain the\nbenefits of his bargain. Or viewed conversely, the Minnesota\nstatute also “impose[s] a consequence” for not satisfying a burden\noutside the contract. Brief for Respondent 51. For as we have\nshown, that law overrides a beneficiary designation only when the\ninsured fails to send in a form to his insurer. See supra, at 10. Of course, the statutes (both old and new) vary in their\nspecific mechanisms. But they all make contract benefits contingent\non some simple filing—or more positively spun, enable a party to\nsafeguard those benefits by taking an action. And that feature is\nwhat the Court, again and again, has found dispositive. Nor does Melin’s attempt to distinguish the\ncases gain force when framed in terms of rights and remedies.\nFirst, not all the old statutes, as a formal matter, confined the\nconsequence of noncompliance to the remedial sphere. In Gilfillan , for example, the result of failing to give\nwritten consent to a settlement was to diminish the interest rate a\nbondholder got, not to prevent him from enforcing a claim against\nothers. And second, even when the consequence formally related to\nenforcement—for example, precluding an earlier purchaser from\ncontesting a later one’s title—the laws in fact wiped out\nsubstantive rights. Failure to record or notify, as noted earlier,\nwould mean that the contracting party lost what (according to his\nagreement) was his land or mortgage or mineral interest. See supra, at 12–13. In Texaco , we replied to an argument\nlike Melin’s by saying that when the results of “eliminating a\nremedy” and “extinguishing a right” are “identical,” the Contracts\nClause “analysis is the same.” 454 U. S., at 528; see El\nPaso , 379 U. S., at 506–507. That statement rebuts Melin’s\nclaim too. Once again: Just like Minnesota’s statute, the laws\ndiscussed above hinged core contractual benefits on compliance with\nnoncontractual paperwork burdens. When all is said and done, that\nlikeness controls. For those reasons, we reverse the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered . Notes 1 See Ala. Code §30–4–17\n(2016); Alaska Stat. §13.12.804 (2016); Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n§14–2804 (2012); Colo. Rev. Stat. §15–11–804 (2017); Fla.

A.\nPhilip Randolph Institute et al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the sixth circuit No. 16–980. Argued January 10, 2018—Decided\nJune 11, 2018 The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA)\naddresses the removal of ineligible voters from state voting rolls,\n52 U. S. C. §20501(b), including those who are ineligible\n“by reason of” a change in residence, §20507(a)(4). The Act\nprescribes requirements that a State must meet in order to remove a\nname on change-of-residence grounds, §§20507(b), (c), (d). The most\nrelevant of these are found in subsection (d), which provides that\na State may not remove a name on change-of-residence grounds unless\nthe registrant either (A) confirms in writing that he or she has\nmoved or (B) fails to return a preaddressed, postage prepaid\n“return card” containing statutorily prescribed content and then\nfails to vote in any election during the period covering the next\ntwo general federal elections. In addition to these specific\nchange-of-residence requirements, the NVRA also contains a general\n“Failure-to-Vote Clause,” §20507(b)(2), consisting of two parts. It\nfirst provides that a state removal program “shall not result in\nthe removal of the name of any person . . . by\nreason of the person’s failure to vote.” Second, as added by the\nHelp America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), it specifies that “nothing in\n[this prohibition] may be construed to prohibit a State from using\nthe procedures” described above—sending a return card and removing\nregistrants who fail to return the card and fail to vote for the\nrequisite time. Since one of the requirements for removal under\nsubsection (d) is the failure to vote, the explanation added by\nHAVA makes clear that the Failure-to-Vote Clause’s prohibition on\nremoval “by reason of the person’s failure to vote” does not\ncategorically preclude using nonvoting as part of a test for\nremoval. Another provision makes this point even more clearly by\nproviding that “no registrant may be removed solely by\nreason of a failure to vote.” §21083(a)(4)(A) (emphasis added). Respondents contend that Ohio’s process for\nremoving voters on change-of-residence grounds violates this\nfederal law. The Ohio process at issue relies on the failure to\nvote for two years as a rough way of identifying voters who may\nhave moved. It sends these nonvoters a preaddressed, postage\nprepaid return card, asking them to verify that they still reside\nat the same address. Voters who do not return the card and fail to vote in any election for four more years are presumed to\nhave moved and are removed from the rolls. Held :The process that Ohio uses to\nremove voters on change-of-residence grounds does not violate the\nFailure-to-Vote Clause or any other part of the NVRA.\nPp. 8–21. (a) Ohio’s law does not violate the\nFailure-to-Vote Clause. Pp. 8–16. (1) Ohio’s removal process follows\nsubsection (d) to the letter: It does not remove a registrant on\nchange-of-residence grounds unless the registrant is sent and fails\nto mail back a return card and then fails to vote for an additional\nfour years. See §20507(d)(1)(B). Pp. 8–9. (2) Nonetheless, respondents argue that\nOhio’s process violates subsection (b)’s Failure-to-Vote Clause by\nusing a person’s failure to vote twice over: once as the trigger\nfor sending return cards and again as one of the two requirements\nfor removal. But Congress could not have meant for the\nFailure-to-Vote Clause to cannibalize subsection (d) in that way.\nInstead, the Failure-to-Vote Clause, both as originally enacted in\nthe NVRA and as amended by HAVA, simply forbids the use of\nnonvoting as the sole criterion for removing a registrant,\nand Ohio does not use it that way. The phrase “by reason of” in the\nFailure-to-Vote Clause denotes some form of causation, see Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. , 557 U. S.\n167, 176, and in context sole causation is the only type of\ncausation that harmonizes the Failure-to-Vote Clause and subsection\n(d). Any other reading would mean that a State that follows\nsubsection (d) nevertheless can violate the Failure-to-Vote Clause.\nWhen Congress enacted HAVA, it made this point explicit by adding\nto the Failure-to-Vote Clause an explanation of how the clause is\nto be read, i.e. , in a way that does not contradict\nsubsection (d). Pp. 9–12. (3) Respondents’ and the dissent’s\nalternative reading is inconsistent with both the text of the\nFailure-to-Vote Clause and the clarification of its meaning in\n§21083(a)(4). Among other things, their reading would make HAVA’s\nnew language worse than redundant, since no sensible person would\nread the Failure-to-Vote Clause as prohibiting what subsections (c)\nand (d) expressly allow. Nor does the Court’s interpretation render\nthe Failure-to-Vote Clause superfluous; the clause retains meaning\nbecause it prohibits States from using nonvoting both as the ground\nfor removal and as the sole evidence for another ground for removal\n( e.g. , as the sole evidence that someone has died).\nPp. 12–15. (4) Respondents’ additional argument—that\nso many registered voters discard return cards upon receipt that\nthe failure to send cards back is worthless as evidence that an\naddressee has moved—is based on a dubious empirical conclusion that\nconflicts with the congressional judgment found in subsection (d).\nCongress clearly did not think that the failure to send back a\nreturn card was of no evidentiary value, having made that conduct\none of the two requirements for removal under subsection (d).\nPp. 15–16. (b) Nor has Ohio violated other NVRA\nprovisions. Pp. 16–21. (1) Ohio removes the registrants at issue\non a permissible ground: change of residence. The failure to return\na notice and the failure to vote simply serve as evidence that a registrant has moved, not as the ground itself for removal.\nPp. 16–17. (2) The NVRA contains no “reliable\nindicator” prerequisite to sending notices, requiring States to\nhave good information that someone has moved before sending them a\nreturn card. So long as the trigger for sending such notices is\n“uniform, nondiscriminatory, and in compliance with the Voting\nRights Act,” §20507(b)(1), States may use whatever trigger they\nthink best, including the failure to vote. Pp. 17–19. (3)  Ohio has not violated the NVRA’s\n“reasonable effort” provision, §20507(a)(4). Even assuming that\nthis provision authorizes federal courts to go beyond the\nrestrictions set out in subsections (b), (c), and (d) and strike\ndown a state law that does not meet some standard of\n“reasonableness,” Ohio’s process cannot be unreasonable because it\nuses the change-of-residence evidence that Congress said it could:\nthe failure to send back a notice coupled with the failure to vote\nfor the requisite period. Ohio’s process is accordingly lawful.\nPp. 19–21. 838 F. 3d 699, reversed. Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court,\nin which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Thomas, and Gorsuch,\nJJ., joined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion. Breyer, J.,\nfiled a dissenting opinion, in which Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and\nKagan, JJ., joined. Sotomayor, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 16–980 _________________ JON HUSTED, OHIO SECRETARY OF STATE,\nPETITIONER v. A. PHILIP RANDOLPH INSTITUTE, et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit [June 11, 2018] Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. It has been estimated that 24 million voter\nregistrations in the United States—about one in eight—are either\ninvalid or significantly inaccurate. Pew Center on the States,\nElection Initiatives Issue Brief (Feb. 2012). And about 2.75\nmillion people are said to be registered to vote in more than one\nState. Ibid. At issue in today’s case is an Ohio law that\naims to keep the State’s voting lists up to date by removing the\nnames of those who have moved out of the district where they are\nregistered. Ohio uses the failure to vote for two years as a rough\nway of identifying voters who may have moved, and it then sends a\npreaddressed, postage prepaid card to these individuals asking them\nto verify that they still reside at the same address. Voters who do\nnot return this card and fail to vote in any election for\nfour more years are presumed to have moved and are removed from the\nrolls. We are asked to decide whether this program complies with\nfederal law. I A Like other States, Ohio requires voters to\nreside in the district in which they vote. Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n§3503.01(A) (West Supp. 2017); see National Conference of State\nLegislatures, Voting by Nonresidents and Non- citizens (Feb. 27,\n2015). When voters move out of that district, they become\nineligible to vote there. See §3503.01(A). And since more than 10%\nof Americans move every year,[ 1 ] deleting the names of those who have moved away is no\nsmall undertaking. For many years, Congress left it up to the\nStates to maintain accurate lists of those eligible to vote in\nfederal elections, but in 1993, with the enactment of the National\nVoter Registration Act (NVRA), Congress intervened. The NVRA\n“erect[s] a complex superstructure of federal regulation atop state\nvoter-registration systems.” Arizona v. Inter Tribal\nCouncil of Ariz., Inc. , 570 U. S. 1, 5 (2013). The Act has\ntwo main objectives: increasing voter registration and removing\nineligible persons from the States’ voter registration rolls. See\n§2, 107Stat. 77, 52 U. S. C. §20501(b). To achieve the latter goal, the NVRA requires\nStates to “conduct a general program that makes a reasonable effort\nto remove the names” of voters who are ineligible “by reason of”\ndeath or change in residence. §20507(a)(4). The Act also prescribes\nrequirements that a State must meet in order to remove a name on\nchange-of-residence grounds. §§20507(b), (c), (d). The most important of these requirements is a\nprior notice obligation. Before the NVRA, some States removed\nregistrants without giving any notice. See J. Harris, Nat. Munic.\nLeague, Model Voter Registration System 45 (rev. 4th ed. 1957). The\nNVRA changed that by providing in §20507(d)(1) that a State may not\nremove a registrant’s name on change-of-residence grounds unless\neither (A) the registrant confirms in writing that he or she has\nmoved or (B) the registrant fails to return a preaddressed, postage\nprepaid “return card” containing statutorily prescribed content.\nThis card must explain what a registrant who has not moved needs to\ndo in order to stay on the rolls, i.e. , either return the\ncard or vote during the period covering the next two general\nfederal elections. §20507(d)(2)(A). And for the benefit of those\nwho have moved, the card must contain “information concerning how\nthe registrant can continue to be eligible to vote.”\n§20507(d)(2)(B). If the State does not send such a card or\notherwise get written notice that the person has moved, it may not\nremove the registrant on change-of-residence grounds. See\n§20507(d)(1).[ 2 ] While the NVRA is clear about the need to send a\n“return card” (or obtain written confirmation of a move) before\npruning a registrant’s name, no provision of federal law specifies\nthe circumstances under which a return card may be sent.\nAccordingly, States take a variety of approaches. See Nat. Assn. of\nSecretaries of State (NASS) Report: Maintenance of State Voter\nRegistration Lists 5–6 (Dec. 2017). The NVRA itself sets out one\noption. A State may send these cards to those who have submitted\n“change-of-address information” to the United States Postal\nService. §20507(c)(1). Thirty-six States do at least that. See NASS\nReport, supra , at 5, and n. v (listing States). Other\nStates send notices to every registered voter at specified\nintervals (say, once a year). See, e.g. , Iowa Code §48 A.\n28.3 (2012); S. C. Code Ann. §§7–5–330(F), 7–5–340(2)–(3)\n(2017 Cum. Supp.); see also S. Rep. No. 103–6, p. 46 (1993).\nStill other States, including Ohio, take an intermediate approach,\nsee NASS Report, supra , at 5–6, such as sending notices to\nthose who have turned in their driver’s licenses, e.g. , Ind.\nCode §§3–7–38.2–2(b)(2), (c)(4) (2004), or sending notices to those\nwho have not voted for some period of time, see, e.g. , Ga.\nCode Ann. §21–2–234 (Supp. 2017); Ohio Rev. Code Ann.\n§3503.21(B)(2); Okla. Admin. Code §230:15–11–19(a)(3) (2016); Pa.\nStat. Ann., Tit. 25, §1901(b)(3) (Purdon 2007); Wis. Stat. Ann.\n§6.50(1) (2017 West Cum. Supp.). When a State receives a return card confirming\nthat a registrant has left the district, the State must remove the\nvoter’s name from the rolls. §§20507(d)(1)(A), (3). And if the\nState receives a card stating that the registrant has not moved,\nthe registrant’s name must be kept on the list. See\n§20507(d)(2)(A). What if no return card is mailed back? Congress\nobviously anticipated that some voters who received cards would\nfail to return them for any number of reasons, and it addressed\nthis contingency in §20507(d), which, for convenience, we will\nsimply call “subsection (d).” Subsection (d) treats the failure to\nreturn a card as some evidence —but by no means conclusive\nproof—that the voter has moved. Instead, the voter’s name is kept\non the list for a period covering two general elections for federal\noffice (usually about four years). Only if the registrant fails to\nvote during that period and does not otherwise confirm that he or\nshe still lives in the district ( e.g. , by updating address\ninformation online) may the registrant’s name be removed.\n§20507(d)(2)(A); see §§20507(d)(1)(B), (3). In addition to these specific\nchange-of-residence requirements, the NVRA also imposes two general\nlimitations that are applicable to state removal programs. First,\nall such programs must be “uniform, nondiscriminatory, and in\ncompliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.” §20507(b)(1).\nSecond, the NVRA contains what we will call the “Failure-to-Vote\nClause.” See §20507(b)(2). At present, this clause contains two parts. The\nfirst is a prohibition that was included in the NVRA when it was\noriginally enacted in 1993. It provides that a state program “shall\nnot result in the removal of the name of any person . . .\nby reason of the person’s failure to vote.” Ibid. The second\npart, added by the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), 116Stat.\n1666, explains the meaning of that prohibition. This explanation\nsays that “nothing in [the prohibition] may be construed to\nprohibit a State from using the procedures described in\n[§§20507](c) and (d) to remove an individual from the official list\nof eligible voters.” §20507(b)(2). These referenced subsections, §§20507(c) and\n(d), are the provisions allowing the removal of registrants who\neither submitted change-of-address information to the Postal\nService (subsection (c)) or did not mail back a return card and did\nnot vote during a period covering two general federal elections\n(subsection (d)). And since one of the requirements for removal\nunder subsection (d) is the failure to vote during this period, the\nexplanation added by HAVA in 2002 makes it clear that the statutory\nphrase “by reason of the person’s failure to vote” in the\nFailure-to-Vote Clause does not categorically preclude the use of\nnonvoting as part of a test for removal. Another provision of HAVA makes this point more\ndirectly. After directing that “registrants who have not responded\nto a notice and . . . have not voted in 2 consecutive\ngeneral elections for Federal office shall be removed,” it adds\nthat “no registrant may be removed solely by reason of a\nfailure to vote.” §21083(a)(4)(A) (emphasis added). B Since 1994, Ohio has used two procedures to\nidentify and remove voters who have lost their residency\nqualification. First, the State utilizes the Postal Service\noption set out in the NVRA. The State sends notices to registrants\nwhom the Postal Service’s “national change of address service”\nidentifies as having moved. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §3503.21(B)(1).\nThis procedure is undisputedly lawful. See 52 U. S. C.\n§20507(c)(1). But because according to the Postal Service\n“[a]s many as 40 percent of people who move do not inform the\nPostal Service,”[ 3 ] Ohio does\nnot rely on this information alone. In its so-called Supplemental\nProcess, Ohio “identif[ies] electors whose lack of voter activity\nindicates they may have moved.” Record 401 (emphasis deleted).\nUnder this process, Ohio sends notices to registrants who have “not\nengage[d] in any voter activity for a period of two consecutive\nyears.” Id. , at 1509. “Voter activity” includes “casting a\nballot” in any election—whether general, primary, or special and\nwhether federal, state, or local. See id. , at 1507. (And\nOhio regularly holds elections on both even and odd years.)\nMoreover, the term “voter activity” is broader than simply voting.\nIt also includes such things as “sign[ing] a petition,” “filing a\nvoter registration form, and updating a voting address with a\nvariety of [state] entities.” Id. , at 295, 357. After sending these notices, Ohio removes\nregistrants from the rolls only if they “fai[l] to respond” and\n“continu[e] to be inactive for an additional period of four\nconsecutive years, including two federal general elections.” Id. , at 1509; see Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §3503.21(B)(2).\nFederal law specifies that a registration may be canceled if the\nregistrant does not vote “in an election during the period”\ncovering two general federal elections after notice,\n§20507(d)(1)(B)(ii), but Ohio rounds up to “four consecutive years”\nof nonvoting after notice, Record 1509. Thus, a person remains on\nthe rolls if he or she votes in any election during that\nperiod—which in Ohio typically means voting in any of the at least\nfour elections after notice. Combined with the two years of\nnonvoting before notice is sent, that makes a total of six years of\nnonvoting before removal. Ibid. C A pair of advocacy groups and an Ohio resident\n(respondents here) think that Ohio’s Supplemental Process violates\nthe NVRA and HAVA. They sued petitioner, Ohio’s Secretary of State,\nseeking to enjoin this process. Respondents alleged, first, that\nOhio removes voters who have not actually moved, thus purging the\nrolls of eligible voters. They also contended that Ohio\nviolates the NVRA’s Failure-to-Vote Clause because the failure to\nvote plays a prominent part in the Ohio removal scheme: Failure to\nvote for two years triggers the sending of a return card, and if\nthe card is not returned, failure to vote for four more years\nresults in removal. The District Court rejected both of these\narguments and entered judgment for the Secretary. It held that\nOhio’s Supplemental Process “mirror[s] the procedures established\nby the NVRA” for removing people on change-of-residence grounds and\ndoes not violate the Failure-to-Vote Clause because it does not\nremove anyone “ solely for [their] failure to vote.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 43a, 57a, 69a–70a. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the\nSixth Circuit reversed. 838 F. 3d 699 (2016). It focused on\nrespondents’ second argument, holding that Ohio violates the\nFailure-to-Vote Clause because it sends change-of-residence notices\n“based ‘solely’ on a person’s failure to vote.” Id. , at 711.\nIn dissent, Judge Siler explained why he saw the case as a simple\none: “The State cannot remove the registrant’s name from the rolls\nfor a failure to vote only, and Ohio does not do [that].” Id. , at 716. We granted certiorari, 581 U. S. ___\n(2017), and now reverse. II A As noted, subsection (d), the provision of the\nNVRA that directly addresses the procedures that a State must\nfollow before removing a registrant from the rolls on\nchange-of-residence grounds, provides that a State may remove a\nregistrant who “(i) has failed to respond to a notice” and “(ii)\nhas not voted or appeared to vote . . . during the pe-\nriod beginning on the date of the notice and ending on the day\nafter the date of the second general election for Fed- eral office\nthat occurs after the date of the notice” (about four years). 52\nU. S. C. §20507(d)(1)(B). Not only are States allowed to\nremove registrants who satisfy these requirements, but federal law\nmakes this removal mandatory. §20507(d)(3); see also\n§21083(a)(4)(A). Ohio’s Supplemental Process follows subsection\n(d) to the letter. It is undisputed that Ohio does not remove a\nregistrant on change-of-residence grounds unless the registrant is\nsent and fails to mail back a return card and then fails to vote\nfor an additional four years. B Respondents argue (and the Sixth Circuit held)\nthat, even if Ohio’s process complies with subsection (d), it\nnevertheless violates the Failure-to-Vote Clause—the clause that\ngenerally prohibits States from removing people from the rolls “by\nreason of [a] person’s failure to vote.” §20507(b)(2); see also\n§21083(a)(4)(A). Respondents point out that Ohio’s Supplemental\nProcess uses a person’s failure to vote twice: once as the trigger\nfor sending return cards and again as one of the requirements for\nremoval. Respondents conclude that this use of nonvoting is\nillegal. We reject this argument because the\nFailure-to-Vote Clause, both as originally enacted in the NVRA and\nas amended by HAVA, simply forbids the use of nonvoting as the\nsole criterion for removing a registrant, and Ohio does not use\nit that way. Instead, as permitted by subsection (d), Ohio removes\nregistrants only if they have failed to vote and have failed\nto respond to a notice. When Congress clarified the meaning of the\nNVRA’s Failure-to-Vote Clause in HAVA, here is what it said:\n“[C]onsistent with the [NVRA], . . . no registrant may be\nremoved solely by reason of a failure to vote.”\n§21083(a)(4)(A) (emphasis added). The meaning of these words is\nstraightforward. “Solely” means “alone.” Webster’s Third New\nInternational Dictionary 2168 (2002); American Heritage Dictionary\n1654 (4th ed. 2000). And “by reason of” is a “quite formal” way of\nsaying “[b]ecause of.” C. Ammer, American Heritage Dictionary of\nIdioms 67 (2d ed. 2013). Thus, a State violates the Failure-to-Vote\nClause only if it removes registrants for no reason other than\ntheir failure to vote. This explanation of the meaning of the\nFailure-to-Vote Clause merely makes explicit what was implicit in\nthe clause as originally enacted. At that time, the clause simply\nsaid that a state program “shall not result in the removal of the\nname of any person from the [rolls for federal elections] by reason\nof the person’s failure to vote.” 107Stat. 83. But that prohibition\nhad to be read together with subsection (d), which authorized\nremoval if a registrant did not send back a return card and also\nfailed to vote during a period covering two successive general\nelections for federal office. If possible, “[w]e must interpret the\nstatute to give effect to both provisions,” Ricci v. DeStefano , 557 U. S. 557, 580 (2009), and here, that is\nquite easy. The phrase “by reason of” denotes some form of\ncausation. See Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. ,\n557 U. S. 167, 176 (2009). Thus, the Failure-to-Vote Clause\napplies when nonvoting, in some sense, causes a registrant’s name\nto be removed, but the law recognizes several types of causation.\nWhen a statutory provision includes an undefined causation\nrequirement, we look to context to decide whether the statute\ndemands only but-for cause as opposed to proximate cause or sole\ncause. See Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection\nCorporation , 503 U. S. 258, 265–268 (1992). Cf. CSX\nTransp., Inc. v. McBride , 564 U. S. 685, 692–693\n(2011). Which form of causation is required by the\nFailure-to-Vote Clause? We can readily rule out but-for causation.\nIf “by reason of” in the Failure-to-Vote Clause meant but-for\ncausation, a State would violate the clause if the failure to vote\nplayed a necessary part in the removal of a name from the list. Burrage v. United States , 571 U. S. 204, 211\n(2014). But the removal process expressly authorized by subsection\n(d) allows a State to remove a registrant if the registrant, in\naddition to failing to send back a return card, fails to vote\nduring a period covering two general federal elections. So if the\nFailure-to-Vote Clause were read in this way, it would cannibalize\nsubsection (d). Interpreting the Failure-to-Vote Clause as\nincorporating a proximate cause requirement would lead to a similar\nproblem. Proximate cause is an elusive concept, see McBride , supra , at 692–693, but no matter how the term is understood,\nit is hard to escape the conclusion that the failure to vote is a\nproximate cause of removal under subsection (d). If a registrant,\nhaving failed to send back a return card, also fails to vote during\nthe period covering the next two general federal elections, removal\nis the direct, foreseeable, and closely connected consequence. See Paroline v. United States , 572 U. S. 434,\n444–445 (2014); Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indemnity\nCo. , 553 U. S. 639, 654 (2008). By process of elimination, we are left with sole\ncausation. This reading harmonizes the Failure-to-Vote Clause and\nsubsection (d) because the latter provision does not authorize\nremoval solely by reason of a person’s failure to vote. Instead,\nsubsection (d) authorizes removal only if a registrant also fails\nto mail back a return card. For these reasons, we conclude that the\nFailure-to-Vote Clause, as originally enacted, referred to sole\ncausation. And when Congress enacted HAVA, it made this point\nexplicit. It added to the Failure-to-Vote Clause itself an\nexplanation of how it is to be read, i.e. , in a way that\ndoes not contradict subsection (d). And in language that cannot be\nmisunderstood, it reiterated what the clause means: “[R]egistrants\nwho have not responded to a notice and who have not voted in 2\nconsecutive general elections for Federal office shall be removed\nfrom the official list of eligible voters, except that no\nregistrant may be removed solely by reason of a failure to\nvote.” §21083(a)(4)(A) (emphasis added). In this way, HAVA\ndispelled any doubt that a state removal program may use the\nfailure to vote as a factor (but not the sole factor) in removing\nnames from the list of registered voters. That is exactly what Ohio’s Supplemental Process\ndoes. It does not strike any registrant solely by reason of the\nfailure to vote. Instead, as expressly permitted by federal law, it\nremoves registrants only when they have failed to vote and have failed to respond to a change-of-residence notice. C Respondents and the dissent advance an\nalternative interpretation of the Failure-to-Vote Clause, but that\nreading is inconsistent with both the text of the clause and the\nclarification of its meaning in §21083(a)(4)(A). Respondents argue\nthat the clause allows States to consider nonvoting only to the\nextent that subsection (d) requires—that is, only after a\nregistrant has failed to mail back a notice. Any other use of the\nfailure to vote, including as the trigger for mailing a notice,\nthey claim, is proscribed. In essence, respondents read the\nlanguage added to the clause by HAVA—“except that nothing in this\nparagraph may be construed to prohibit a State from using the\nprocedures described in subsections (c) and (d)”—as an exception to\nthe general rule forbidding the use of nonvoting. See Brief for\nRespondents 37. And the Sixth Circuit seemed to find this point\ndispositive, reasoning that “ ‘exceptions in statutes must be\nstrictly construed.’ ” 838 F. 3d, at 708 (quoting Detroit Edison Co. v. SEC , 119 F. 2d 730, 739\n(CA6 1941)). We reject this argument for three reasons.\nFirst, it distorts what the new language added by HAVA actually\nsays. The new language does not create an exception to a general\nrule against the use of nonvoting. It does not say that the failure\nto vote may not be used “except that this paragraph does not\nprohibit a State from using the procedures described in subsections\n(c) and (d).” Instead, it says that “nothing in this paragraph may be construed ” to have that effect. §20507(b)(2)\n(emphasis added). Thus, it sets out not an exception, but a rule of\ninterpretation. It does not narrow the language that precedes it;\nit clarifies what that language means. That is precisely what\nCongress said when it enacted HAVA: It added the “may not be\nconstrued” provision to “[c]larif[y],” not to alter, the\nprohibition’s scope. §903, 116Stat. 1728. Second, under respondents’ reading, HAVA’s new\nlanguage is worse than superfluous. Even without the added\nlanguage, no sensible person would read the Failure-to-Vote Clause\nas prohibiting what subsections (c) and (d) expressly allow. Yet\naccording to respondents, that is all that the new language\naccomplishes. So at a minimum, it would be redundant. But the implications of this reading are\nactually worse than that. There is no reason to create an exception\nto a prohibition unless the prohibition would otherwise forbid what\nthe exception allows. So if the new language were an exception, it\nwould seem to follow that prior to HAVA, the Failure-to-Vote Clause did outlaw what subsections (c) and (d) specifically\nauthorize. And that, of course, would be nonsensical. Third, respondents’ reading of the language that\nHAVA added to the Failure-to-Vote Clause makes it hard to\nunderstand why Congress prescribed in another section of the same\nAct, i.e. , §21083(a)(4)(A), that “no registrant may be\nremoved solely by reason of a failure to vote.” As interpreted by\nrespondents, the amended Failure-to-Vote Clause prohibits any use\nof nonvoting with just two narrow exceptions—the uses allowed by\nsubsections (c) and (d). So, according to respondents, the amended\nFailure-to-Vote Clause prohibits much more than §21083(a)(4)(A).\nThat provision, in addition to allowing the use of nonvoting in\naccordance with subsections (c) and (d), also permits the use of\nnonvoting in any other way that does not treat nonvoting as the\nsole basis for removal. There is no plausible reason why Congress would\nenact the provision that respondents envision. As interpreted by\nrespondents, HAVA would be like a law that contains one provision\nmaking it illegal to drive with a blood alcohol level of 0.08 or\nhigher and another provision making it illegal to drive with a\nblood alcohol level of 0.10 or higher. The second provision would\nnot only be redundant; it would be confusing and downright\nsilly. Our reading, on the other hand, gives the new\nlanguage added to the Failure-to-Vote Clause “real and substantial\neffect.” Husky Int’l Electronics, Inc. v. Ritz , 578\nU. S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). It clarifies the meaning of the prohibition against\nremoval by reason of nonvoting, a matter that troubled some States\nprior to HAVA’s enactment. See, e.g. , FEC Report on the NVRA\nto the 106th Congress 19 (1999). Respondents and the dissent separately claim\nthat the Failure-to-Vote Clause must be read to bar the use of\nnonvoting as a trigger for sending return cards because otherwise\nit would be “superfluous.” Post , at 17 (opinion of Breyer,\nJ.); see Brief for Respondents 29. After all, subsection (d)\nalready prohibits States from removing registrants because of a\nfailure to vote alone. See §20507(d)(1). To have meaning\nindependent of subsection (d), respondents reason, the\nFailure-to-Vote Clause must prohibit other uses of the failure to\nvote, including its use as a trigger for sending out notices. This argument is flawed because the\nFailure-to-Vote Clause has plenty of work to do under our reading.\nMost important, it prohibits the once-common state practice of\nremoving registered voters simply because they failed to vote for\nsome period of time. Not too long ago, “[c]ancellation for failure\nto vote [was] the principal means used . . . to purge the\n[voter] lists.” Harris, Model Voter Registration System, at 44.\nStates did not use a person’s failure to vote as evidence that the\nperson had died or moved but as an independent ground for removal.\nSee ibid. [ 4 ] Ohio was\none such State. Its Constitution provided that “[a]ny elector who\nfails to vote in at least one election during any period of four\nconsecutive years shall cease to be an elector unless he again\nregisters to vote.” Art. V, §1 (1977). In addition, our reading prohibits States from\nusing the failure to vote as the sole cause for removal on any ground, not just because of a change of residence.\nRecall that subsection (d)’s removal process app",
    "textpassage": "\"Ohio’s Supplemental Process follows subsection (d) to the letter. It is undisputed that Ohio does not remove a registrant on change-of-residence grounds unless the registrant is sent and fails to mail back a return card and then fails to vote for an additional four years.\""

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd., et al. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission et al. certiorari to the court of appeals of\ncolorado No. 16–111. Argued December 5, 2017—Decided\nJune 4, 2018 Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd., is a Colorado\nbakery owned and operated by Jack Phillips, an expert baker and\ndevout Christian. In 2012 he told a same-sex couple that he would\nnot create a cake for their wedding celebration because of his\nreligious opposition to same-sex marriages—marriages that Colorado\ndid not then recognize—but that he would sell them other baked\ngoods, e.g., birthday cakes. The couple filed a charge with\nthe Colorado Civil Rights Commission (Commission) pursuant to the\nColorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA), which prohibits, as\nrelevant here, discrimination based on sexual orientation in a\n“place of business engaged in any sales to the public and any place\noffering services . . . to the public.” Under CADA’s\nadministrative review system, the Colorado Civil Rights Division\nfirst found probable cause for a violation and referred the case to\nthe Commission. The Commission then referred the case for a formal\nhearing before a state Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), who ruled in\nthe couple’s favor. In so doing, the ALJ rejected Phillips’ First\nAmendment claims: that requiring him to create a cake for a\nsame-sex wedding would violate his right to free speech by\ncompelling him to exercise his artistic talents to express a\nmessage with which he disagreed and would violate his right to the\nfree exercise of religion. Both the Commission and the Colorado\nCourt of Appeals affirmed. Held : The Commission’s actions in\nthis case violated the Free Exercise Clause. Pp. 9–18. (a) The laws and the Constitution can,\nand in some instances must, protect gay persons and gay couples in\nthe exercise of their civil rights, but religious and philosophical\nobjections to gay marriage are protected views and in some\ninstances protected forms of expression. See Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___. While it is unexceptional\nthat Colorado law can protect gay persons in acquiring products and\nservices on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other\nmembers of the public, the law must be applied in a manner that is\nneutral toward religion. To Phillips, his claim that using his\nartistic skills to make an expressive statement, a wedding\nendorsement in his own voice and of his own creation, has a\nsignificant First Amendment speech component and implicates his\ndeep and sincere religious beliefs. His dilemma was understandable\nin 2012, which was before Colorado recognized the validity of gay\nmarriages performed in the State and before this Court issued United States v. Windsor , 570 U. S. 744, or Obergefell . Given the State’s position at the time, there is\nsome force to Phillips’ argument that he was not unreasonable in\ndeeming his decision lawful. State law at the time also afforded\nstorekeepers some latitude to decline to create specific messages\nthey considered offensive. Indeed, while the instant enforcement\nproceedings were pending, the State Civil Rights Division concluded\nin at least three cases that a baker acted lawfully in declining to\ncreate cakes with decorations that demeaned gay persons or gay\nmarriages. Phillips too was entitled to a neutral and respectful\nconsideration of his claims in all the circumstances of the case.\nPp. 9–12. (b) That consideration was compromised,\nhowever, by the Commission’s treatment of Phillips’ case, which\nshowed elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the\nsincere religious beliefs motivating his objection. As the record\nshows, some of the commissioners at the Commission’s formal, public\nhearings endorsed the view that religious beliefs cannot\nlegitimately be carried into the public sphere or commercial\ndomain, disparaged Phillips’ faith as despicable and characterized\nit as merely rhetorical, and compared his invocation of his\nsincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the\nHolocaust. No commissioners objected to the comments. Nor were they\nmentioned in the later state-court ruling or disavowed in the\nbriefs filed here. The comments thus cast doubt on the fairness and\nimpartiality of the Commission’s adjudication of Phillips’\ncase. Another indication of hostility is the\ndifferent treatment of Phillips’ case and the cases of other bakers\nwith objections to anti-gay messages who prevailed before the\nCommission. The Commission ruled against Phillips in part on the\ntheory that any message on the requested wedding cake would be\nattributed to the customer, not to the baker. Yet the Division did\nnot address this point in any of the cases involving requests for\ncakes depicting anti-gay marriage symbolism. The Division also\nconsidered that each bakery was willing to sell other products to\nthe prospective customers, but the Commission found Phillips’\nwillingness to do the same irrelevant. The State Court of Appeals’\nbrief discussion of this disparity of treatment does not answer\nPhillips’ concern that the State’s practice was to disfavor the\nreligious basis of his objection. Pp. 12–16. (c) For these reasons, the Commission’s\ntreatment of Phillips’ case violated the State’s duty under the\nFirst Amendment not to base laws or regulations on hostility to a\nreligion or religious viewpoint. The government, consistent with\nthe Constitution’s guarantee of free exercise, cannot impose\nregulations that are hostile to the religious beliefs of affected\ncitizens and cannot act in a manner that passes judgment upon or\npresupposes the illegitimacy of religious beliefs and practices. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508\nU. S. 520. Factors relevant to the assessment of governmental\nneutrality include “the historical background of the decision under\nchallenge, the specific series of events leading to the enactment\nor official policy in question, and the legislative or\nadministrative history, including contemporaneous statements made\nby members of the decisionmaking body.” Id ., at 540. In view\nof these factors, the record here demonstrates that the\nCommission’s consideration of Phillips’ case was neither tolerant\nnor respectful of his religious beliefs. The Commission gave “every\nappearance,” id ., at 545, of adjudicating his religious\nobjection based on a negative normative “evaluation of the\nparticular justification” for his objection and the religious\ngrounds for it, id ., at 537, but government has no role in\nexpressing or even suggesting whether the religious ground for\nPhillips’ conscience-based objection is legitimate or illegitimate.\nThe inference here is thus that Phillips’ religious objection was\nnot considered with the neutrality required by the Free Exercise\nClause. The State’s interest could have been weighed against\nPhillips’ sincere religious objections in a way consistent with the\nrequisite religious neutrality that must be strictly observed. But\nthe official expressions of hostility to religion in some of the\ncommissioners’ comments were inconsistent with that requirement,\nand the Commission’s disparate consideration of Phillips’ case\ncompared to the cases of the other bakers suggests the same.\nPp. 16–18. 370 P. 3d 272, reversed.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 16–111 _________________ MASTERPIECE CAKESHOP, LTD., et al.,\nPETITIONERS v. COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION,\net al. on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals\nof colorado [June 4, 2018] Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. In 2012 a same-sex couple visited Masterpiece\nCakeshop, a bakery in Colorado, to make inquiries about ordering a\ncake for their wedding reception. The shop’s owner told the couple\nthat he would not create a cake for their wedding because of his\nreligious opposition to same-sex marriages—marriages the State of\nColorado itself did not recognize at that time. The couple filed a\ncharge with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission alleging\ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in violation of\nthe Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act. The Commission determined that the shop’s\nactions violated the Act and ruled in the couple’s favor. The\nColorado state courts affirmed the ruling and its enforcement\norder, and this Court now must decide whether the Commission’s\norder violated the Constitution. The case presents difficult questions as to the\nproper reconciliation of at least two principles. The first is the\nauthority of a State and its governmental entities to protect the\nrights and dignity of gay persons who are, or wish to be, married\nbut who face discrimination when they seek goods or services. The\nsecond is the right of all persons to exercise fundamental freedoms\nunder the First Amendment, as applied to the States through the\nFourteenth Amendment. The freedoms asserted here are both the freedom\nof speech and the free exercise of religion. The free speech aspect\nof this case is difficult, for few persons who have seen a\nbeautiful wedding cake might have thought of its creation as an\nexercise of protected speech. This is an instructive example,\nhowever, of the proposition that the application of constitutional\nfreedoms in new contexts can deepen our understanding of their\nmeaning. One of the difficulties in this case is that the\nparties disagree as to the extent of the baker’s refusal to provide\nservice. If a baker refused to design a special cake with words or\nimages celebrating the marriage—for instance, a cake showing words\nwith religious meaning—that might be different from a refusal to\nsell any cake at all. In defining whether a baker’s creation can be\nprotected, these details might make a difference. The same difficulties arise in determining\nwhether a baker has a valid free exercise claim. A baker’s refusal\nto attend the wedding to ensure that the cake is cut the right way,\nor a refusal to put certain religious words or decorations on the\ncake, or even a refusal to sell a cake that has been baked for the\npublic generally but includes certain religious words or symbols on\nit are just three examples of possibilities that seem all but\nendless. Whatever the confluence of speech and free\nexercise principles might be in some cases, the Colorado Civil\nRights Commission’s consideration of this case was inconsistent\nwith the State’s obligation of religious neutrality. The reason and\nmotive for the baker’s refusal were based on his sincere religious\nbeliefs and convictions. The Court’s precedents make clear that the\nbaker, in his capacity as the owner of a business serving the\npublic, might have his right to the free exercise of religion\nlimited by generally applicable laws. Still, the delicate question\nof when the free exercise of his religion must yield to an\notherwise valid exercise of state power needed to be determined in\nan adjudication in which religious hostility on the part of the\nState itself would not be a factor in the balance the State sought\nto reach. That requirement, however, was not met here. When the\nColorado Civil Rights Commission considered this case, it did not\ndo so with the religious neutrality that the Constitution\nrequires. Given all these considerations, it is proper to\nhold that whatever the outcome of some future controversy involving\nfacts similar to these, the Commission’s actions here violated the\nFree Exercise Clause; and its order must be set aside. I A Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd., is a bakery in\nLakewood, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. The shop offers a variety\nof baked goods, ranging from everyday cookies and brownies to\nelaborate custom-designed cakes for birthday parties, weddings, and\nother events. Jack Phillips is an expert baker who has owned\nand operated the shop for 24 years. Phillips is a devout Christian.\nHe has explained that his “main goal in life is to be obedient to”\nJesus Christ and Christ’s “teachings in all aspects of his life.”\nApp. 148. And he seeks to “honor God through his work at\nMasterpiece Cakeshop.” Ibid. One of Phillips’ religious\nbeliefs is that “God’s intention for marriage from the beginning of\nhistory is that it is and should be the union of one man and one\nwoman.” Id. , at 149. To Phillips, creating a wedding cake\nfor a same-sex wedding would be equivalent to participating in a\ncelebration that is contrary to his own most deeply held\nbeliefs. Phillips met Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins when\nthey entered his shop in the summer of 2012. Craig and Mullins were\nplanning to marry. At that time, Colorado did not recognize\nsame-sex marriages, so the couple planned to wed legally in\nMassachusetts and afterwards to host a reception for their family\nand friends in Denver. To prepare for their celebration, Craig and\nMullins visited the shop and told Phillips that they were\ninterested in ordering a cake for “our wedding.” Id. , at 152\n(emphasis de- leted). They did not mention the design of the cake\nthey envisioned. Phillips informed the couple that he does not\n“create” wedding cakes for same-sex weddings. Ibid. He\nexplained, “I’ll make your birthday cakes, shower cakes, sell you\ncookies and brownies, I just don’t make cakes for same sex\nweddings.” Ibid . The couple left the shop without further\ndiscussion. The following day, Craig’s mother, who had\naccompanied the couple to the cakeshop and been present for their\ninteraction with Phillips, telephoned to ask Phillips why he had\ndeclined to serve her son. Phillips explained that he does not\ncreate wedding cakes for same-sex weddings because of his religious\nopposition to same-sex marriage, and also because Colorado (at that\ntime) did not recognize same-sex marriages. Id. , at 153. He\nlater explained his belief that “to create a wedding cake for an\nevent that celebrates something that directly goes against the\nteachings of the Bible, would have been a personal endorsement and\nparticipation in the ceremony and relationship that they were\nentering into.” Ibid . (emphasis deleted). B For most of its history, Colorado has\nprohibited discrimination in places of public accommodation. In\n1885, less than a decade after Colorado achieved statehood, the\nGeneral Assembly passed “An Act to Protect All Citizens in Their\nCivil Rights,” which guaranteed “full and equal enjoyment” of\ncertain public facilities to “all citizens,” “regardless of race,\ncolor or previous condition of servitude.” 1885 Colo. Sess. Laws\npp. 132–133. A decade later, the General Assembly expanded the\nrequirement to apply to “all other places of public accommodation.”\n1895 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 61, p. 139. Today, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act\n(CADA) carries forward the state’s tradition of prohibiting\ndiscrimination in places of public accommodation. Amended in 2007\nand 2008 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation as well as other protected characteristics, CADA in\nrelevant part provides as follows: “It is a discriminatory practice and unlawful\nfor a person, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from, or\ndeny to an individual or a group, because of disability, race,\ncreed, color, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national\norigin, or ancestry, the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,\nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of\na place of public accommodation.” Colo. Rev. Stat. §24–34–601(2)(a)\n(2017). The Act defines “public accommodation” broadly\nto include any “place of business engaged in any sales to the\npublic and any place offering services . . . to the\npublic,” but excludes “a church, synagogue, mosque, or other place\nthat is principally used for religious purposes.”\n§24–34–601(1). CADA establishes an administrative system for\nthe resolution of discrimination claims. Complaints of\ndiscrimination in violation of CADA are addressed in the first\ninstance by the Colorado Civil Rights Division. The Division\ninvestigates each claim; and if it finds probable cause that CADA\nhas been violated, it will refer the matter to the Colorado Civil\nRights Commission. The Commission, in turn, decides whether to\ninitiate a formal hearing before a state Administrative Law Judge\n(ALJ), who will hear evidence and argument before issuing a written\ndecision. See §§24–34–306, 24–4–105(14). The decision of the ALJ\nmay be appealed to the full Commission, a seven-member appointed\nbody. The Commission holds a public hearing and deliberative\nsession before voting on the case. If the Commission determines\nthat the evidence proves a CADA violation, it may impose remedial\nmeasures as provided by statute. See §24–34–306(9). Available\nremedies include, among other things, orders to cease-and-desist a\ndiscriminatory policy, to file regular compliance reports with the\nCommission, and “to take affirmative action, including the posting\nof notices setting forth the substantive rights of the public.”\n§24–34–605. Colorado law does not permit the Commission to assess\nmoney damages or fines. §§24–34–306(9), 24–34–605. C Craig and Mullins filed a discrimination\ncomplaint against Masterpiece Cakeshop and Phillips in August 2012,\nshortly after the couple’s visit to the shop. App. 31. The\ncomplaint alleged that Craig and Mullins had been denied “full and\nequal service” at the bakery because of their sexual orientation, id. , at 35, 48, and that it was Phillips’ “standard business\npractice” not to provide cakes for same-sex weddings, id. ,\nat 43. The Civil Rights Division opened an\ninvestigation. The investigator found that “on multiple occasions,”\nPhillips “turned away potential customers on the basis of their\nsexual orientation, stating that he could not create a cake for a\nsame-sex wedding ceremony or reception” because his religious\nbeliefs prohibited it and because the potential customers “were\ndoing something illegal” at that time. Id. , at 76. The\ninvestigation found that Phillips had declined to sell custom\nwedding cakes to about six other same-sex couples on this basis. Id. , at 72. The investigator also recounted that, according\nto affidavits submitted by Craig and Mullins, Phillips’ shop had\nrefused to sell cupcakes to a lesbian couple for their commitment\ncelebration because the shop “had a policy of not selling baked\ngoods to same-sex couples for this type of event.” Id. , at\n73. Based on these findings, the Division found probable cause that\nPhillips violated CADA and referred the case to the Civil Rights\nCommission. Id. , at 69. The Commission found it proper to conduct a\nformal hearing, and it sent the case to a State ALJ. Finding no\ndispute as to material facts, the ALJ entertained cross-motions for\nsummary judgment and ruled in the couple’s favor. The ALJ first\nrejected Phillips’ argument that declining to make or create a\nwedding cake for Craig and Mullins did not violate Colorado law. It\nwas undisputed that the shop is subject to state public\naccommodations laws. And the ALJ determined that Phillips’ actions\nconstituted prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex- ual\norientation, not simply opposition to same-sex marriage as Phillips\ncontended. App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a–72a. Phillips raised two constitutional claims before\nthe ALJ. He first asserted that applying CADA in a way that would\nrequire him to create a cake for a same-sex wedding would violate\nhis First Amendment right to free speech by compelling him to\nexercise his artistic talents to express a message with which he\ndisagreed. The ALJ rejected the contention that preparing a wedding\ncake is a form of protected speech and did not agree that creating\nCraig and Mullins’ cake would force Phillips to adhere to “an\nideological point of view.” Id. , at 75a. Applying CADA to\nthe facts at hand, in the ALJ’s view, did not interfere with\nPhillips’ freedom of speech. Phillips also contended that requiring him to\ncreate cakes for same-sex weddings would violate his right to the\nfree exercise of religion, also protected by the First Amendment.\nCiting this Court’s precedent in Employment Div., Dept. of Human\nResources of Ore. v. Smith , 494 U. S. 872 (1990),\nthe ALJ determined that CADA is a “valid and neutral law of general\napplicability” and therefore that applying it to Phillips in this\ncase did not violate the Free Exercise Clause. Id ., at 879;\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 82a–83a. The ALJ thus ruled against Phillips\nand the cakeshop and in favor of Craig and Mullins on both\nconstitutional claims. The Commission affirmed the ALJ’s decision in\nfull. Id. , at 57a. The Commission ordered Phillips to “cease\nand desist from discriminating against . . . same-sex couples by\nrefusing to sell them wedding cakes or any product [they] would\nsell to heterosexual couples.” Ibid. It also ordered\nadditional remedial measures, including “comprehensive staff\ntraining on the Public Accommodations section” of CADA “and changes\nto any and all company policies to comply with . . . this\nOrder.” Id. , at 58a. The Commission additionally required\nPhillips to prepare “quarterly compliance reports” for a period of\ntwo years documenting “the number of patrons denied service” and\nwhy, along with “a statement describing the remedial actions\ntaken.” Ibid. Phillips appealed to the Colorado Court of\nAppeals, which affirmed the Commission’s legal determinations and\nremedial order. The court rejected the argument that the\n“Commission’s order unconstitutionally compels” Phillips and the\nshop “to convey a celebratory message about same sex marriage.” Craig v. Masterpiece Cakeshop, Inc. , 370 P. 3d\n272, 283 (2015). The court also rejected the argument that the\nCommission’s order violated the Free Exercise Clause. Relying on\nthis Court’s precedent in Smith , supra , at 879, the\ncourt stated that the Free Exercise Clause “does not relieve an\nindividual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law\nof general applicability” on the ground that following the law\nwould interfere with religious practice or belief. 370 P. 3d,\nat 289. The court concluded that requiring Phillips to comply with\nthe statute did not violate his free exercise rights. The Colorado\nSupreme Court declined to hear the case. Phillips sought review here, and this Court\ngranted certiorari. 582 U. S. ___ (2017). He now renews his\nclaims under the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the First\nAmendment. II A Our society has come to the recognition that\ngay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or\nas inferior in dignity and worth. For that reason the laws and the\nConstitution can, and in some instances must, protect them in the\nexercise of their civil rights. The exercise of their freedom on\nterms equal to others must be given great weight and respect by the\ncourts. At the same time, the religious and philosophical\nobjections to gay marriage are protected views and in some\ninstances protected forms of expression. As this Court observed in Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___ (2015),\n“[t]he First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and\npersons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the\nprinciples that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and\nfaiths.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 27). Nevertheless, while\nthose religious and philosophical objections are protected, it is a\ngeneral rule that such objections do not allow business owners and\nother actors in the economy and in society to deny protected\npersons equal access to goods and services under a neutral and\ngenerally applicable public accommodations law. See Newman v. Piggy Park Enterprises, Inc. , 390 U. S. 400, 402, n.\n5 (1968) ( per curiam ); see also Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston,\nInc. , 515 U. S. 557, 572 (1995) (“Provisions like these\nare well within the State’s usual power to enact when a legislature\nhas reason to believe that a given group is the target of\ndiscrimination, and they do not, as a general matter, violate the\nFirst or Fourteenth Amendments”). When it comes to weddings, it can be assumed\nthat a member of the clergy who objects to gay marriage on moral\nand religious grounds could not be compelled to perform the\nceremony without denial of his or her right to the free exercise of\nreligion. This refusal would be well understood in our\nconstitutional order as an exercise of religion, an exercise that\ngay persons could recognize and accept without serious diminishment\nto their own dignity and worth. Yet if that exception were not\nconfined, then a long list of persons who provide goods and\nservices for marriages and weddings might refuse to do so for gay\npersons, thus resulting in a community-wide stigma inconsistent\nwith the history and dynamics of civil rights laws that ensure\nequal access to goods, services, and public accommodations. It is unexceptional that Colorado law can\nprotect gay persons, just as it can protect other classes of\nindividuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they\nchoose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other\nmembers of the public. And there are no doubt innumerable goods and\nservices that no one could argue implicate the First Amendment.\nPetitioners conceded, moreover, that if a baker refused to sell any\ngoods or any cakes for gay weddings, that would be a different\nmatter and the State would have a strong case under this Court’s\nprecedents that this would be a denial of goods and services that\nwent beyond any protected rights of a baker who offers goods and\nservices to the general public and is subject to a neutrally\napplied and generally applicable public accommodations law. See Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 4–7, 10. Phillips claims, however, that a narrower issue\nis presented. He argues that he had to use his artistic skills to\nmake an expressive statement, a wedding endorsement in his own\nvoice and of his own creation. As Phillips would see the case, this\ncontention has a significant First Amendment speech component and\nimplicates his deep and sincere religious beliefs. In this context\nthe baker likely found it difficult to find a line where the\ncustomers’ rights to goods and services became a demand for him to\nexercise the right of his own personal expression for their\nmessage, a message he could not express in a way consistent with\nhis religious beliefs. Phillips’ dilemma was particularly\nunderstandable given the background of legal principles and\nadministration of the law in Colorado at that time. His decision\nand his actions leading to the refusal of service all occurred in\nthe year 2012. At that point, Colorado did not recognize the\nvalidity of gay marriages performed in its own State. See Colo.\nConst., Art. II, §31 (2012); 370 P. 3d, at 277. At the\ntime of the events in question, this Court had not issued its\ndecisions either in United States v. Windsor , 570\nU. S. 744 (2013), or Obergefell . Since the State itself\ndid not allow those marriages to be performed in Colorado, there is\nsome force to the argument that the baker was not unreasonable in\ndeeming it lawful to decline to take an action that he understood\nto be an expression of support for their validity when that\nexpression was contrary to his sincerely held religious beliefs, at\nleast insofar as his refusal was limited to refusing to create and\nexpress a message in support of gay marriage, even one planned to\ntake place in another State. At the time, state law also afforded\nstorekeepers some latitude to decline to create specific messages\nthe storekeeper considered offensive. Indeed, while enforcement\nproceedings against Phillips were ongoing, the Colorado Civil\nRights Division itself endorsed this proposition in cases involving\nother bakers’ creation of cakes, concluding on at least three\noccasions that a baker acted lawfully in declining to create cakes\nwith decorations that demeaned gay persons or gay marriages. See Jack v. Gateaux, Ltd. , Charge No. P20140071X (Mar.\n24, 2015); Jack v. Le Bakery Sensual, Inc. , Charge\nNo. P20140070X (Mar. 24, 2015); Jack v. Azucar\nBakery , Charge No. P20140069X (Mar. 24, 2015). There were, to be sure, responses to these\narguments that the State could make when it contended for a\ndifferent result in seeking the enforcement of its generally\napplicable state regulations of businesses that serve the public.\nAnd any decision in favor of the baker would have to be\nsufficiently constrained, lest all purveyors of goods and services\nwho object to gay marriages for moral and religious reasons in\neffect be allowed to put up signs saying “no goods or services will\nbe sold if they will be used for gay marriages,” something that\nwould impose a serious stigma on gay persons. But, nonetheless,\nPhillips was entitled to the neutral and respectful consideration\nof his claims in all the circumstances of the case. B The neutral and respectful consideration to\nwhich Phillips was entitled was compromised here, however. The\nCivil Rights Commission’s treatment of his case has some elements\nof a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious\nbeliefs that motivated his objection. That hostility surfaced at the Commission’s\nformal, public hearings, as shown by the record. On May 30, 2014,\nthe seven-member Commission convened publicly to consider Phillips’\ncase. At several points during its meeting, commissioners endorsed\nthe view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into\nthe public sphere or commercial domain, implying that religious\nbeliefs and persons are less than fully welcome in Colorado’s\nbusiness community. One commissioner suggested that Phillips can\nbelieve “what he wants to believe,” but cannot act on his religious\nbeliefs “if he decides to do business in the state.” Tr. 23. A few\nmoments later, the commissioner restated the same position: “[I]f a\nbusinessman wants to do business in the state and he’s got an issue\nwith the—the law’s impacting his personal belief system, he needs\nto look at being able to compromise.” Id ., at 30. Standing\nalone, these statements are susceptible of different\ninterpretations. On the one hand, they might mean simply that a\nbusiness cannot refuse to provide services based on sexual\norientation, regardless of the proprietor’s personal views. On the\nother hand, they might be seen as inappropriate and dismissive\ncomments showing lack of due consideration for Phillips’ free\nexercise rights and the dilemma he faced. In view of the comments\nthat followed, the latter seems the more likely. On July 25, 2014, the Commission met again. This\nmeeting, too, was conducted in public and on the record. On this\noccasion another commissioner made specific reference to the\nprevious meeting’s discussion but said far more to disparage\nPhillips’ beliefs. The commissioner stated: “I would also like to reiterate what we said in\nthe hearing or the last meeting. Freedom of religion and religion\nhas been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout\nhistory, whether it be slavery, whether it be the holocaust,\nwhether it be—I mean, we—we can list hundreds of situations where\nfreedom of religion has been used to justify discrimination. And to\nme it is one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people\ncan use to—to use their religion to hurt others.” Tr. 11–12. To describe a man’s faith as “one of the most\ndespicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use” is to disparage\nhis religion in at least two distinct ways: by describing it as\ndespicable, and also by characterizing it as merely\nrhetorical—something insubstantial and even insincere. The\ncommissioner even went so far as to compare Phillips’ invocation of\nhis sincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the\nHolocaust. This sentiment is inappropriate for a Commission charged\nwith the solemn responsibility of fair and neutral enforcement of\nColorado’s antidiscrimination law—a law that protects\ndiscrimination on the basis of religion as well as sexual\norientation. The record shows no objection to these comments\nfrom other commissioners. And the later state-court ruling\nreviewing the Commission’s decision did not mention those comments,\nmuch less",

Colorado Civil Rights Commission et al. certiorari to the court of appeals of\ncolorado No. 16–111. Argued December 5, 2017—Decided\nJune 4, 2018 Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd., is a Colorado\nbakery owned and operated by Jack Phillips, an expert baker and\ndevout Christian. In 2012 he told a same-sex couple that he would\nnot create a cake for their wedding celebration because of his\nreligious opposition to same-sex marriages—marriages that Colorado\ndid not then recognize—but that he would sell them other baked\ngoods, e.g., birthday cakes. The couple filed a charge with\nthe Colorado Civil Rights Commission (Commission) pursuant to the\nColorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA), which prohibits, as\nrelevant here, discrimination based on sexual orientation in a\n“place of business engaged in any sales to the public and any place\noffering services . . . to the public.” Under CADA’s\nadministrative review system, the Colorado Civil Rights Division\nfirst found probable cause for a violation and referred the case to\nthe Commission. The Commission then referred the case for a formal\nhearing before a state Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), who ruled in\nthe couple’s favor. In so doing, the ALJ rejected Phillips’ First\nAmendment claims: that requiring him to create a cake for a\nsame-sex wedding would violate his right to free speech by\ncompelling him to exercise his artistic talents to express a\nmessage with which he disagreed and would violate his right to the\nfree exercise of religion. Both the Commission and the Colorado\nCourt of Appeals affirmed. Held : The Commission’s actions in\nthis case violated the Free Exercise Clause. Pp. 9–18. (a) The laws and the Constitution can,\nand in some instances must, protect gay persons and gay couples in\nthe exercise of their civil rights, but religious and philosophical\nobjections to gay marriage are protected views and in some\ninstances protected forms of expression. See Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___. While it is unexceptional\nthat Colorado law can protect gay persons in acquiring products and\nservices on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other\nmembers of the public, the law must be applied in a manner that is\nneutral toward religion. To Phillips, his claim that using his\nartistic skills to make an expressive statement, a wedding\nendorsement in his own voice and of his own creation, has a\nsignificant First Amendment speech component and implicates his\ndeep and sincere religious beliefs. His dilemma was understandable\nin 2012, which was before Colorado recognized the validity of gay\nmarriages performed in the State and before this Court issued United States v. Windsor , 570 U. S. 744, or Obergefell . Given the State’s position at the time, there is\nsome force to Phillips’ argument that he was not unreasonable in\ndeeming his decision lawful. State law at the time also afforded\nstorekeepers some latitude to decline to create specific messages\nthey considered offensive. Indeed, while the instant enforcement\nproceedings were pending, the State Civil Rights Division concluded\nin at least three cases that a baker acted lawfully in declining to\ncreate cakes with decorations that demeaned gay persons or gay\nmarriages. Phillips too was entitled to a neutral and respectful\nconsideration of his claims in all the circumstances of the case.\nPp. 9–12. (b) That consideration was compromised,\nhowever, by the Commission’s treatment of Phillips’ case, which\nshowed elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the\nsincere religious beliefs motivating his objection. As the record\nshows, some of the commissioners at the Commission’s formal, public\nhearings endorsed the view that religious beliefs cannot\nlegitimately be carried into the public sphere or commercial\ndomain, disparaged Phillips’ faith as despicable and characterized\nit as merely rhetorical, and compared his invocation of his\nsincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the\nHolocaust. No commissioners objected to the comments. Nor were they\nmentioned in the later state-court ruling or disavowed in the\nbriefs filed here. The comments thus cast doubt on the fairness and\nimpartiality of the Commission’s adjudication of Phillips’\ncase. Another indication of hostility is the\ndifferent treatment of Phillips’ case and the cases of other bakers\nwith objections to anti-gay messages who prevailed before the\nCommission. The Commission ruled against Phillips in part on the\ntheory that any message on the requested wedding cake would be\nattributed to the customer, not to the baker. Yet the Division did\nnot address this point in any of the cases involving requests for\ncakes depicting anti-gay marriage symbolism. The Division also\nconsidered that each bakery was willing to sell other products to\nthe prospective customers, but the Commission found Phillips’\nwillingness to do the same irrelevant. The State Court of Appeals’\nbrief discussion of this disparity of treatment does not answer\nPhillips’ concern that the State’s practice was to disfavor the\nreligious basis of his objection. Pp. 12–16. (c) For these reasons, the Commission’s\ntreatment of Phillips’ case violated the State’s duty under the\nFirst Amendment not to base laws or regulations on hostility to a\nreligion or religious viewpoint. The government, consistent with\nthe Constitution’s guarantee of free exercise, cannot impose\nregulations that are hostile to the religious beliefs of affected\ncitizens and cannot act in a manner that passes judgment upon or\npresupposes the illegitimacy of religious beliefs and practices. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508\nU. S. 520. Factors relevant to the assessment of governmental\nneutrality include “the historical background of the decision under\nchallenge, the specific series of events leading to the enactment\nor official policy in question, and the legislative or\nadministrative history, including contemporaneous statements made\nby members of the decisionmaking body.” Id ., at 540. In view\nof these factors, the record here demonstrates that the\nCommission’s consideration of Phillips’ case was neither tolerant\nnor respectful of his religious beliefs. The Commission gave “every\nappearance,” id ., at 545, of adjudicating his religious\nobjection based on a negative normative “evaluation of the\nparticular justification” for his objection and the religious\ngrounds for it, id ., at 537, but government has no role in\nexpressing or even suggesting whether the religious ground for\nPhillips’ conscience-based objection is legitimate or illegitimate.\nThe inference here is thus that Phillips’ religious objection was\nnot considered with the neutrality required by the Free Exercise\nClause. The State’s interest could have been weighed against\nPhillips’ sincere religious objections in a way consistent with the\nrequisite religious neutrality that must be strictly observed. But\nthe official expressions of hostility to religion in some of the\ncommissioners’ comments were inconsistent with that requirement,\nand the Commission’s disparate consideration of Phillips’ case\ncompared to the cases of the other bakers suggests the same.\nPp. 16–18. 370 P. 3d 272, reversed. Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Breyer, Alito, Kagan, and\nGorsuch, JJ., joined. Kagan, J., filed a concurring opinion, in\nwhich Breyer, J., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 16–111 _________________ MASTERPIECE CAKESHOP, LTD., et al.,\nPETITIONERS v. COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION,\net al. on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals\nof colorado [June 4, 2018] Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. In 2012 a same-sex couple visited Masterpiece\nCakeshop, a bakery in Colorado, to make inquiries about ordering a\ncake for their wedding reception. The shop’s owner told the couple\nthat he would not create a cake for their wedding because of his\nreligious opposition to same-sex marriages—marriages the State of\nColorado itself did not recognize at that time. The couple filed a\ncharge with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission alleging\ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in violation of\nthe Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act. The Commission determined that the shop’s\nactions violated the Act and ruled in the couple’s favor. The\nColorado state courts affirmed the ruling and its enforcement\norder, and this Court now must decide whether the Commission’s\norder violated the Constitution. The case presents difficult questions as to the\nproper reconciliation of at least two principles. The first is the\nauthority of a State and its governmental entities to protect the\nrights and dignity of gay persons who are, or wish to be, married\nbut who face discrimination when they seek goods or services. The\nsecond is the right of all persons to exercise fundamental freedoms\nunder the First Amendment, as applied to the States through the\nFourteenth Amendment. The freedoms asserted here are both the freedom\nof speech and the free exercise of religion. The free speech aspect\nof this case is difficult, for few persons who have seen a\nbeautiful wedding cake might have thought of its creation as an\nexercise of protected speech. This is an instructive example,\nhowever, of the proposition that the application of constitutional\nfreedoms in new contexts can deepen our understanding of their\nmeaning. One of the difficulties in this case is that the\nparties disagree as to the extent of the baker’s refusal to provide\nservice. If a baker refused to design a special cake with words or\nimages celebrating the marriage—for instance, a cake showing words\nwith religious meaning—that might be different from a refusal to\nsell any cake at all. In defining whether a baker’s creation can be\nprotected, these details might make a difference. The same difficulties arise in determining\nwhether a baker has a valid free exercise claim. A baker’s refusal\nto attend the wedding to ensure that the cake is cut the right way,\nor a refusal to put certain religious words or decorations on the\ncake, or even a refusal to sell a cake that has been baked for the\npublic generally but includes certain religious words or symbols on\nit are just three examples of possibilities that seem all but\nendless. Whatever the confluence of speech and free\nexercise principles might be in some cases, the Colorado Civil\nRights Commission’s consideration of this case was inconsistent\nwith the State’s obligation of religious neutrality. The reason and\nmotive for the baker’s refusal were based on his sincere religious\nbeliefs and convictions. The Court’s precedents make clear that the\nbaker, in his capacity as the owner of a business serving the\npublic, might have his right to the free exercise of religion\nlimited by generally applicable laws. Still, the delicate question\nof when the free exercise of his religion must yield to an\notherwise valid exercise of state power needed to be determined in\nan adjudication in which religious hostility on the part of the\nState itself would not be a factor in the balance the State sought\nto reach. That requirement, however, was not met here. When the\nColorado Civil Rights Commission considered this case, it did not\ndo so with the religious neutrality that the Constitution\nrequires. Given all these considerations, it is proper to\nhold that whatever the outcome of some future controversy involving\nfacts similar to these, the Commission’s actions here violated the\nFree Exercise Clause; and its order must be set aside. I A Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd., is a bakery in\nLakewood, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. The shop offers a variety\nof baked goods, ranging from everyday cookies and brownies to\nelaborate custom-designed cakes for birthday parties, weddings, and\nother events. Jack Phillips is an expert baker who has owned\nand operated the shop for 24 years. Phillips is a devout Christian.\nHe has explained that his “main goal in life is to be obedient to”\nJesus Christ and Christ’s “teachings in all aspects of his life.”\nApp. 148. And he seeks to “honor God through his work at\nMasterpiece Cakeshop.” Ibid. One of Phillips’ religious\nbeliefs is that “God’s intention for marriage from the beginning of\nhistory is that it is and should be the union of one man and one\nwoman.” Id. , at 149. To Phillips, creating a wedding cake\nfor a same-sex wedding would be equivalent to participating in a\ncelebration that is contrary to his own most deeply held\nbeliefs. Phillips met Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins when\nthey entered his shop in the summer of 2012. Craig and Mullins were\nplanning to marry. At that time, Colorado did not recognize\nsame-sex marriages, so the couple planned to wed legally in\nMassachusetts and afterwards to host a reception for their family\nand friends in Denver. To prepare for their celebration, Craig and\nMullins visited the shop and told Phillips that they were\ninterested in ordering a cake for “our wedding.” Id. , at 152\n(emphasis de- leted). They did not mention the design of the cake\nthey envisioned. Phillips informed the couple that he does not\n“create” wedding cakes for same-sex weddings. Ibid. He\nexplained, “I’ll make your birthday cakes, shower cakes, sell you\ncookies and brownies, I just don’t make cakes for same sex\nweddings.” Ibid . The couple left the shop without further\ndiscussion. The following day, Craig’s mother, who had\naccompanied the couple to the cakeshop and been present for their\ninteraction with Phillips, telephoned to ask Phillips why he had\ndeclined to serve her son. Phillips explained that he does not\ncreate wedding cakes for same-sex weddings because of his religious\nopposition to same-sex marriage, and also because Colorado (at that\ntime) did not recognize same-sex marriages. Id. , at 153. He\nlater explained his belief that “to create a wedding cake for an\nevent that celebrates something that directly goes against the\nteachings of the Bible, would have been a personal endorsement and\nparticipation in the ceremony and relationship that they were\nentering into.” Ibid . (emphasis deleted). B For most of its history, Colorado has\nprohibited discrimination in places of public accommodation. In\n1885, less than a decade after Colorado achieved statehood, the\nGeneral Assembly passed “An Act to Protect All Citizens in Their\nCivil Rights,” which guaranteed “full and equal enjoyment” of\ncertain public facilities to “all citizens,” “regardless of race,\ncolor or previous condition of servitude.” 1885 Colo. Sess. Laws\npp. 132–133. A decade later, the General Assembly expanded the\nrequirement to apply to “all other places of public accommodation.”\n1895 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 61, p. 139. Today, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act\n(CADA) carries forward the state’s tradition of prohibiting\ndiscrimination in places of public accommodation. Amended in 2007\nand 2008 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation as well as other protected characteristics, CADA in\nrelevant part provides as follows: “It is a discriminatory practice and unlawful\nfor a person, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from, or\ndeny to an individual or a group, because of disability, race,\ncreed, color, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national\norigin, or ancestry, the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,\nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of\na place of public accommodation.” Colo. Rev. Stat. §24–34–601(2)(a)\n(2017). The Act defines “public accommodation” broadly\nto include any “place of business engaged in any sales to the\npublic and any place offering services . . . to the\npublic,” but excludes “a church, synagogue, mosque, or other place\nthat is principally used for religious purposes.”\n§24–34–601(1). CADA establishes an administrative system for\nthe resolution of discrimination claims. Complaints of\ndiscrimination in violation of CADA are addressed in the first\ninstance by the Colorado Civil Rights Division. The Division\ninvestigates each claim; and if it finds probable cause that CADA\nhas been violated, it will refer the matter to the Colorado Civil\nRights Commission. The Commission, in turn, decides whether to\ninitiate a formal hearing before a state Administrative Law Judge\n(ALJ), who will hear evidence and argument before issuing a written\ndecision. See §§24–34–306, 24–4–105(14). The decision of the ALJ\nmay be appealed to the full Commission, a seven-member appointed\nbody. The Commission holds a public hearing and deliberative\nsession before voting on the case. If the Commission determines\nthat the evidence proves a CADA violation, it may impose remedial\nmeasures as provided by statute. See §24–34–306(9). Available\nremedies include, among other things, orders to cease-and-desist a\ndiscriminatory policy, to file regular compliance reports with the\nCommission, and “to take affirmative action, including the posting\nof notices setting forth the substantive rights of the public.”\n§24–34–605. Colorado law does not permit the Commission to assess\nmoney damages or fines. §§24–34–306(9), 24–34–605. C Craig and Mullins filed a discrimination\ncomplaint against Masterpiece Cakeshop and Phillips in August 2012,\nshortly after the couple’s visit to the shop. App. 31. The\ncomplaint alleged that Craig and Mullins had been denied “full and\nequal service” at the bakery because of their sexual orientation, id. , at 35, 48, and that it was Phillips’ “standard business\npractice” not to provide cakes for same-sex weddings, id. ,\nat 43. The Civil Rights Division opened an\ninvestigation. The investigator found that “on multiple occasions,”\nPhillips “turned away potential customers on the basis of their\nsexual orientation, stating that he could not create a cake for a\nsame-sex wedding ceremony or reception” because his religious\nbeliefs prohibited it and because the potential customers “were\ndoing something illegal” at that time. Id. , at 76. The\ninvestigation found that Phillips had declined to sell custom\nwedding cakes to about six other same-sex couples on this basis. Id. , at 72. The investigator also recounted that, according\nto affidavits submitted by Craig and Mullins, Phillips’ shop had\nrefused to sell cupcakes to a lesbian couple for their commitment\ncelebration because the shop “had a policy of not selling baked\ngoods to same-sex couples for this type of event.” Id. , at\n73. Based on these findings, the Division found probable cause that\nPhillips violated CADA and referred the case to the Civil Rights\nCommission. Id. , at 69. The Commission found it proper to conduct a\nformal hearing, and it sent the case to a State ALJ. Finding no\ndispute as to material facts, the ALJ entertained cross-motions for\nsummary judgment and ruled in the couple’s favor. The ALJ first\nrejected Phillips’ argument that declining to make or create a\nwedding cake for Craig and Mullins did not violate Colorado law. It\nwas undisputed that the shop is subject to state public\naccommodations laws. And the ALJ determined that Phillips’ actions\nconstituted prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex- ual\norientation, not simply opposition to same-sex marriage as Phillips\ncontended. App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a–72a. Phillips raised two constitutional claims before\nthe ALJ. He first asserted that applying CADA in a way that would\nrequire him to create a cake for a same-sex wedding would violate\nhis First Amendment right to free speech by compelling him to\nexercise his artistic talents to express a message with which he\ndisagreed. The ALJ rejected the contention that preparing a wedding\ncake is a form of protected speech and did not agree that creating\nCraig and Mullins’ cake would force Phillips to adhere to “an\nideological point of view.” Id. , at 75a. Applying CADA to\nthe facts at hand, in the ALJ’s view, did not interfere with\nPhillips’ freedom of speech. Phillips also contended that requiring him to\ncreate cakes for same-sex weddings would violate his right to the\nfree exercise of religion, also protected by the First Amendment.\nCiting this Court’s precedent in Employment Div., Dept. of Human\nResources of Ore. v. Smith , 494 U. S. 872 (1990),\nthe ALJ determined that CADA is a “valid and neutral law of general\napplicability” and therefore that applying it to Phillips in this\ncase did not violate the Free Exercise Clause. Id ., at 879;\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 82a–83a. The ALJ thus ruled against Phillips\nand the cakeshop and in favor of Craig and Mullins on both\nconstitutional claims. The Commission affirmed the ALJ’s decision in\nfull. Id. , at 57a. The Commission ordered Phillips to “cease\nand desist from discriminating against . . . same-sex couples by\nrefusing to sell them wedding cakes or any product [they] would\nsell to heterosexual couples.” Ibid. It also ordered\nadditional remedial measures, including “comprehensive staff\ntraining on the Public Accommodations section” of CADA “and changes\nto any and all company policies to comply with . . . this\nOrder.” Id. , at 58a. The Commission additionally required\nPhillips to prepare “quarterly compliance reports” for a period of\ntwo years documenting “the number of patrons denied service” and\nwhy, along with “a statement describing the remedial actions\ntaken.” Ibid. Phillips appealed to the Colorado Court of\nAppeals, which affirmed the Commission’s legal determinations and\nremedial order. The court rejected the argument that the\n“Commission’s order unconstitutionally compels” Phillips and the\nshop “to convey a celebratory message about same sex marriage.” Craig v. Masterpiece Cakeshop, Inc. , 370 P. 3d\n272, 283 (2015). The court also rejected the argument that the\nCommission’s order violated the Free Exercise Clause. Relying on\nthis Court’s precedent in Smith , supra , at 879, the\ncourt stated that the Free Exercise Clause “does not relieve an\nindividual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law\nof general applicability” on the ground that following the law\nwould interfere with religious practice or belief. 370 P. 3d,\nat 289. The court concluded that requiring Phillips to comply with\nthe statute did not violate his free exercise rights. The Colorado\nSupreme Court declined to hear the case. Phillips sought review here, and this Court\ngranted certiorari. 582 U. S. ___ (2017). He now renews his\nclaims under the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the First\nAmendment. II A Our society has come to the recognition that\ngay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or\nas inferior in dignity and worth. For that reason the laws and the\nConstitution can, and in some instances must, protect them in the\nexercise of their civil rights. The exercise of their freedom on\nterms equal to others must be given great weight and respect by the\ncourts. At the same time, the religious and philosophical\nobjections to gay marriage are protected views and in some\ninstances protected forms of expression. As this Court observed in Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___ (2015),\n“[t]he First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and\npersons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the\nprinciples that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and\nfaiths.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 27). Nevertheless, while\nthose religious and philosophical objections are protected, it is a\ngeneral rule that such objections do not allow business owners and\nother actors in the economy and in society to deny protected\npersons equal access to goods and services under a neutral and\ngenerally applicable public accommodations law. See Newman v. Piggy Park Enterprises, Inc. , 390 U. S. 400, 402, n.\n5 (1968) ( per curiam ); see also Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston,\nInc. , 515 U. S. 557, 572 (1995) (“Provisions like these\nare well within the State’s usual power to enact when a legislature\nhas reason to believe that a given group is the target of\ndiscrimination, and they do not, as a general matter, violate the\nFirst or Fourteenth Amendments”). When it comes to weddings, it can be assumed\nthat a member of the clergy who objects to gay marriage on moral\nand religious grounds could not be compelled to perform the\nceremony without denial of his or her right to the free exercise of\nreligion. This refusal would be well understood in our\nconstitutional order as an exercise of religion, an exercise that\ngay persons could recognize and accept without serious diminishment\nto their own dignity and worth. Yet if that exception were not\nconfined, then a long list of persons who provide goods and\nservices for marriages and weddings might refuse to do so for gay\npersons, thus resulting in a community-wide stigma inconsistent\nwith the history and dynamics of civil rights laws that ensure\nequal access to goods, services, and public accommodations. It is unexceptional that Colorado law can\nprotect gay persons, just as it can protect other classes of\nindividuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they\nchoose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other\nmembers of the public. And there are no doubt innumerable goods and\nservices that no one could argue implicate the First Amendment.\nPetitioners conceded, moreover, that if a baker refused to sell any\ngoods or any cakes for gay weddings, that would be a different\nmatter and the State would have a strong case under this Court’s\nprecedents that this would be a denial of goods and services that\nwent beyond any protected rights of a baker who offers goods and\nservices to the general public and is subject to a neutrally\napplied and generally applicable public accommodations law. See Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 4–7, 10. Phillips claims, however, that a narrower issue\nis presented. He argues that he had to use his artistic skills to\nmake an expressive statement, a wedding endorsement in his own\nvoice and of his own creation. As Phillips would see the case, this\ncontention has a significant First Amendment speech component and\nimplicates his deep and sincere religious beliefs. In this context\nthe baker likely found it difficult to find a line where the\ncustomers’ rights to goods and services became a demand for him to\nexercise the right of his own personal expression for their\nmessage, a message he could not express in a way consistent with\nhis religious beliefs. Phillips’ dilemma was particularly\nunderstandable given the background of legal principles and\nadministration of the law in Colorado at that time. His decision\nand his actions leading to the refusal of service all occurred in\nthe year 2012. At that point, Colorado did not recognize the\nvalidity of gay marriages performed in its own State. See Colo.\nConst., Art. II, §31 (2012); 370 P. 3d, at 277. At the\ntime of the events in question, this Court had not issued its\ndecisions either in United States v. Windsor , 570\nU. S. 744 (2013), or Obergefell . Since the State itself\ndid not allow those marriages to be performed in Colorado, there is\nsome force to the argument that the baker was not unreasonable in\ndeeming it lawful to decline to take an action that he understood\nto be an expression of support for their validity when that\nexpression was contrary to his sincerely held religious beliefs, at\nleast insofar as his refusal was limited to refusing to create and\nexpress a message in support of gay marriage, even one planned to\ntake place in another State. At the time, state law also afforded\nstorekeepers some latitude to decline to create specific messages\nthe storekeeper considered offensive. Indeed, while enforcement\nproceedings against Phillips were ongoing, the Colorado Civil\nRights Division itself endorsed this proposition in cases involving\nother bakers’ creation of cakes, concluding on at least three\noccasions that a baker acted lawfully in declining to create cakes\nwith decorations that demeaned gay persons or gay marriages. See Jack v. Gateaux, Ltd. , Charge No. P20140071X (Mar.\n24, 2015); Jack v. Le Bakery Sensual, Inc. , Charge\nNo. P20140070X (Mar. 24, 2015); Jack v. Azucar\nBakery , Charge No. P20140069X (Mar. 24, 2015). There were, to be sure, responses to these\narguments that the State could make when it contended for a\ndifferent result in seeking the enforcement of its generally\napplicable state regulations of businesses that serve the public.\nAnd any decision in favor of the baker would have to be\nsufficiently constrained, lest all purveyors of goods and services\nwho object to gay marriages for moral and religious reasons in\neffect be allowed to put up signs saying “no goods or services will\nbe sold if they will be used for gay marriages,” something that\nwould impose a serious stigma on gay persons. But, nonetheless,\nPhillips was entitled to the neutral and respectful consideration\nof his claims in all the circumstances of the case. B The neutral and respectful consideration to\nwhich Phillips was entitled was compromised here, however. The\nCivil Rights Commission’s treatment of his case has some elements\nof a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious\nbeliefs that motivated his objection. That hostility surfaced at the Commission’s\nformal, public hearings, as shown by the record. On May 30, 2014,\nthe seven-member Commission convened publicly to consider Phillips’\ncase. At several points during its meeting, commissioners endorsed\nthe view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into\nthe public sphere or commercial domain, implying that religious\nbeliefs and persons are less than fully welcome in Colorado’s\nbusiness community. One commissioner suggested that Phillips can\nbelieve “what he wants to believe,” but cannot act on his religious\nbeliefs “if he decides to do business in the state.” Tr. 23. A few\nmoments later, the commissioner restated the same position: “[I]f a\nbusinessman wants to do business in the state and he’s got an issue\nwith the—the law’s impacting his personal belief system, he needs\nto look at being able to compromise.” Id ., at 30. Standing\nalone, these statements are susceptible of different\ninterpretations. On the one hand, they might mean simply that a\nbusiness cannot refuse to provide services based on sexual\norientation, regardless of the proprietor’s personal views. On the\nother hand, they might be seen as inappropriate and dismissive\ncomments showing lack of due consideration for Phillips’ free\nexercise rights and the dilemma he faced. In view of the comments\nthat followed, the latter seems the more likely. On July 25, 2014, the Commission met again. This\nmeeting, too, was conducted in public and on the record. On this\noccasion another commissioner made specific reference to the\nprevious meeting’s discussion but said far more to disparage\nPhillips’ beliefs. The commissioner stated: “I would also like to reiterate what we said in\nthe hearing or the last meeting. Freedom of religion and religion\nhas been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout\nhistory, whether it be slavery, whether it be the holocaust,\nwhether it be—I mean, we—we can list hundreds of situations where\nfreedom of religion has been used to justify discrimination. And to\nme it is one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people\ncan use to—to use their religion to hurt others.” Tr. 11–12. To describe a man’s faith as “one of the most\ndespicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use” is to disparage\nhis religion in at least two distinct ways: by describing it as\ndespicable, and also by characterizing it as merely\nrhetorical—something insubstantial and even insincere. The\ncommissioner even went so far as to compare Phillips’ invocation of\nhis sincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the\nHolocaust. This sentiment is inappropriate for a Commission charged\nwith the solemn responsibility of fair and neutral enforcement of\nColorado’s antidiscrimination law—a law that protects\ndiscrimination on the basis of religion as well as sexual\norientation. The record shows no objection to these comments\nfrom other commissioners. And the later state-court ruling\nreviewing the Commission’s decision did not mention those comments,\nmuch less",

Colorado Civil Rights Commission et al. certiorari to the court of appeals of\ncolorado No. 16–111. Argued December 5, 2017—Decided\nJune 4, 2018 Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd., is a Colorado\nbakery owned and operated by Jack Phillips, an expert baker and\ndevout Christian. In 2012 he told a same-sex couple that he would\nnot create a cake for their wedding celebration because of his\nreligious opposition to same-sex marriages—marriages that Colorado\ndid not then recognize—but that he would sell them other baked\ngoods, e.g., birthday cakes. The couple filed a charge with\nthe Colorado Civil Rights Commission (Commission) pursuant to the\nColorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA), which prohibits, as\nrelevant here, discrimination based on sexual orientation in a\n“place of business engaged in any sales to the public and any place\noffering services . . . to the public.” Under CADA’s\nadministrative review system, the Colorado Civil Rights Division\nfirst found probable cause for a violation and referred the case to\nthe Commission. The Commission then referred the case for a formal\nhearing before a state Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), who ruled in\nthe couple’s favor. In so doing, the ALJ rejected Phillips’ First\nAmendment claims: that requiring him to create a cake for a\nsame-sex wedding would violate his right to free speech by\ncompelling him to exercise his artistic talents to express a\nmessage with which he disagreed and would violate his right to the\nfree exercise of religion. Both the Commission and the Colorado\nCourt of Appeals affirmed. Held : The Commission’s actions in\nthis case violated the Free Exercise Clause. Pp. 9–18. (a) The laws and the Constitution can,\nand in some instances must, protect gay persons and gay couples in\nthe exercise of their civil rights, but religious and philosophical\nobjections to gay marriage are protected views and in some\ninstances protected forms of expression. See Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___, ___. While it is unexceptional\nthat Colorado law can protect gay persons in acquiring products and\nservices on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other\nmembers of the public, the law must be applied in a manner that is\nneutral toward religion. To Phillips, his claim that using his\nartistic skills to make an expressive statement, a wedding\nendorsement in his own voice and of his own creation, has a\nsignificant First Amendment speech component and implicates his\ndeep and sincere religious beliefs. His dilemma was understandable\nin 2012, which was before Colorado recognized the validity of gay\nmarriages performed in the State and before this Court issued United States v. Windsor , 570 U. S. 744, or Obergefell . Given the State’s position at the time, there is\nsome force to Phillips’ argument that he was not unreasonable in\ndeeming his decision lawful. State law at the time also afforded\nstorekeepers some latitude to decline to create specific messages\nthey considered offensive. Indeed, while the instant enforcement\nproceedings were pending, the State Civil Rights Division concluded\nin at least three cases that a baker acted lawfully in declining to\ncreate cakes with decorations that demeaned gay persons or gay\nmarriages. Phillips too was entitled to a neutral and respectful\nconsideration of his claims in all the circumstances of the case.\nPp. 9–12. (b) That consideration was compromised,\nhowever, by the Commission’s treatment of Phillips’ case, which\nshowed elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the\nsincere religious beliefs motivating his objection. As the record\nshows, some of the commissioners at the Commission’s formal, public\nhearings endorsed the view that religious beliefs cannot\nlegitimately be carried into the public sphere or commercial\ndomain, disparaged Phillips’ faith as despicable and characterized\nit as merely rhetorical, and compared his invocation of his\nsincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the\nHolocaust. No commissioners objected to the comments. Nor were they\nmentioned in the later state-court ruling or disavowed in the\nbriefs filed here. The comments thus cast doubt on the fairness and\nimpartiality of the Commission’s adjudication of Phillips’\ncase. Another indication of hostility is the\ndifferent treatment of Phillips’ case and the cases of other bakers\nwith objections to anti-gay messages who prevailed before the\nCommission. The Commission ruled against Phillips in part on the\ntheory that any message on the requested wedding cake would be\nattributed to the customer, not to the baker. Yet the Division did\nnot address this point in any of the cases involving requests for\ncakes depicting anti-gay marriage symbolism. The Division also\nconsidered that each bakery was willing to sell other products to\nthe prospective customers, but the Commission found Phillips’\nwillingness to do the same irrelevant. The State Court of Appeals’\nbrief discussion of this disparity of treatment does not answer\nPhillips’ concern that the State’s practice was to disfavor the\nreligious basis of his objection. Pp. 12–16. (c) For these reasons, the Commission’s\ntreatment of Phillips’ case violated the State’s duty under the\nFirst Amendment not to base laws or regulations on hostility to a\nreligion or religious viewpoint. The government, consistent with\nthe Constitution’s guarantee of free exercise, cannot impose\nregulations that are hostile to the religious beliefs of affected\ncitizens and cannot act in a manner that passes judgment upon or\npresupposes the illegitimacy of religious beliefs and practices. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508\nU. S. 520. Factors relevant to the assessment of governmental\nneutrality include “the historical background of the decision under\nchallenge, the specific series of events leading to the enactment\nor official policy in question, and the legislative or\nadministrative history, including contemporaneous statements made\nby members of the decisionmaking body.” Id ., at 540. In view\nof these factors, the record here demonstrates that the\nCommission’s consideration of Phillips’ case was neither tolerant\nnor respectful of his religious beliefs. The Commission gave “every\nappearance,” id ., at 545, of adjudicating his religious\nobjection based on a negative normative “evaluation of the\nparticular justification” for his objection and the religious\ngrounds for it, id ., at 537, but government has no role in\nexpressing or even suggesting whether the religious ground for\nPhillips’ conscience-based objection is legitimate or illegitimate.\nThe inference here is thus that Phillips’ religious objection was\nnot considered with the neutrality required by the Free Exercise\nClause. The State’s interest could have been weighed against\nPhillips’ sincere religious objections in a way consistent with the\nrequisite religious neutrality that must be strictly observed. But\nthe official expressions of hostility to religion in some of the\ncommissioners’ comments were inconsistent with that requirement,\nand the Commission’s disparate consideration of Phillips’ case\ncompared to the cases of the other bakers suggests the same.\nPp. 16–18. 370 P. 3d 272, reversed. Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Breyer, Alito, Kagan, and\nGorsuch, JJ., joined. Kagan, J., filed a concurring opinion, in\nwhich Breyer, J., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 16–111 _________________ MASTERPIECE CAKESHOP, LTD., et al.,\nPETITIONERS v. COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION,\net al. on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals\nof colorado [June 4, 2018] Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. In 2012 a same-sex couple visited Masterpiece\nCakeshop, a bakery in Colorado, to make inquiries about ordering a\ncake for their wedding reception. The shop’s owner told the couple\nthat he would not create a cake for their wedding because of his\nreligious opposition to same-sex marriages—marriages the State of\nColorado itself did not recognize at that time. The couple filed a\ncharge with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission alleging\ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in violation of\nthe Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act. The Commission determined that the shop’s\nactions violated the Act and ruled in the couple’s favor. The\nColorado state courts affirmed the ruling and its enforcement\norder, and this Court now must decide whether the Commission’s\norder violated the Constitution. The case presents difficult questions as to the\nproper reconciliation of at least two principles. The first is the\nauthority of a State and its governmental entities to protect the\nrights and dignity of gay persons who are, or wish to be, married\nbut who face discrimination when they seek goods or services. The\nsecond is the right of all persons to exercise fundamental freedoms\nunder the First Amendment, as applied to the States through the\nFourteenth Amendment. The freedoms asserted here are both the freedom\nof speech and the free exercise of religion. The free speech aspect\nof this case is difficult, for few persons who have seen a\nbeautiful wedding cake might have thought of its creation as an\nexercise of protected speech. This is an instructive example,\nhowever, of the proposition that the application of constitutional\nfreedoms in new contexts can deepen our understanding of their\nmeaning. One of the difficulties in this case is that the\nparties disagree as to the extent of the baker’s refusal to provide\nservice. If a baker refused to design a special cake with words or\nimages celebrating the marriage—for instance, a cake showing words\nwith religious meaning—that might be different from a refusal to\nsell any cake at all. In defining whether a baker’s creation can be\nprotected, these details might make a difference. The same difficulties arise in determining\nwhether a baker has a valid free exercise claim. A baker’s refusal\nto attend the wedding to ensure that the cake is cut the right way,\nor a refusal to put certain religious words or decorations on the\ncake, or even a refusal to sell a cake that has been baked for the\npublic generally but includes certain religious words or symbols on\nit are just three examples of possibilities that seem all but\nendless. Whatever the confluence of speech and free\nexercise principles might be in some cases, the Colorado Civil\nRights Commission’s consideration of this case was inconsistent\nwith the State’s obligation of religious neutrality. The reason and\nmotive for the baker’s refusal were based on his sincere religious\nbeliefs and convictions. The Court’s precedents make clear that the\nbaker, in his capacity as the owner of a business serving the\npublic, might have his right to the free exercise of religion\nlimited by generally applicable laws. Still, the delicate question\nof when the free exercise of his religion must yield to an\notherwise valid exercise of state power needed to be determined in\nan adjudication in which religious hostility on the part of the\nState itself would not be a factor in the balance the State sought\nto reach. That requirement, however, was not met here. When the\nColorado Civil Rights Commission considered this case, it did not\ndo so with the religious neutrality that the Constitution\nrequires. Given all these considerations, it is proper to\nhold that whatever the outcome of some future controversy involving\nfacts similar to these, the Commission’s actions here violated the\nFree Exercise Clause; and its order must be set aside. I A Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd., is a bakery in\nLakewood, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. The shop offers a variety\nof baked goods, ranging from everyday cookies and brownies to\nelaborate custom-designed cakes for birthday parties, weddings, and\nother events. Jack Phillips is an expert baker who has owned\nand operated the shop for 24 years. Phillips is a devout Christian.\nHe has explained that his “main goal in life is to be obedient to”\nJesus Christ and Christ’s “teachings in all aspects of his life.”\nApp. 148. And he seeks to “honor God through his work at\nMasterpiece Cakeshop.” Ibid. One of Phillips’ religious\nbeliefs is that “God’s intention for marriage from the beginning of\nhistory is that it is and should be the union of one man and one\nwoman.” Id. , at 149. To Phillips, creating a wedding cake\nfor a same-sex wedding would be equivalent to participating in a\ncelebration that is contrary to his own most deeply held\nbeliefs. Phillips met Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins when\nthey entered his shop in the summer of 2012. Craig and Mullins were\nplanning to marry. At that time, Colorado did not recognize\nsame-sex marriages, so the couple planned to wed legally in\nMassachusetts and afterwards to host a reception for their family\nand friends in Denver. To prepare for their celebration, Craig and\nMullins visited the shop and told Phillips that they were\ninterested in ordering a cake for “our wedding.” Id. , at 152\n(emphasis de- leted). They did not mention the design of the cake\nthey envisioned. Phillips informed the couple that he does not\n“create” wedding cakes for same-sex weddings. Ibid. He\nexplained, “I’ll make your birthday cakes, shower cakes, sell you\ncookies and brownies, I just don’t make cakes for same sex\nweddings.” Ibid . The couple left the shop without further\ndiscussion. The following day, Craig’s mother, who had\naccompanied the couple to the cakeshop and been present for their\ninteraction with Phillips, telephoned to ask Phillips why he had\ndeclined to serve her son. Phillips explained that he does not\ncreate wedding cakes for same-sex weddings because of his religious\nopposition to same-sex marriage, and also because Colorado (at that\ntime) did not recognize same-sex marriages. Id. , at 153. He\nlater explained his belief that “to create a wedding cake for an\nevent that celebrates something that directly goes against the\nteachings of the Bible, would have been a personal endorsement and\nparticipation in the ceremony and relationship that they were\nentering into.” Ibid . (emphasis deleted). B For most of its history, Colorado has\nprohibited discrimination in places of public accommodation. In\n1885, less than a decade after Colorado achieved statehood, the\nGeneral Assembly passed “An Act to Protect All Citizens in Their\nCivil Rights,” which guaranteed “full and equal enjoyment” of\ncertain public facilities to “all citizens,” “regardless of race,\ncolor or previous condition of servitude.” 1885 Colo. Sess. Laws\npp. 132–133. A decade later, the General Assembly expanded the\nrequirement to apply to “all other places of public accommodation.”\n1895 Colo. Sess. Laws ch. 61, p. 139. Today, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act\n(CADA) carries forward the state’s tradition of prohibiting\ndiscrimination in places of public accommodation. Amended in 2007\nand 2008 to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation as well as other protected characteristics, CADA in\nrelevant part provides as follows: “It is a discriminatory practice and unlawful\nfor a person, directly or indirectly, to refuse, withhold from, or\ndeny to an individual or a group, because of disability, race,\ncreed, color, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national\norigin, or ancestry, the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,\nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of\na place of public accommodation.” Colo. Rev. Stat. §24–34–601(2)(a)\n(2017). The Act defines “public accommodation” broadly\nto include any “place of business engaged in any sales to the\npublic and any place offering services . . . to the\npublic,” but excludes “a church, synagogue, mosque, or other place\nthat is principally used for religious purposes.”\n§24–34–601(1). CADA establishes an administrative system for\nthe resolution of discrimination claims. Complaints of\ndiscrimination in violation of CADA are addressed in the first\ninstance by the Colorado Civil Rights Division. The Division\ninvestigates each claim; and if it finds probable cause that CADA\nhas been violated, it will refer the matter to the Colorado Civil\nRights Commission. The Commission, in turn, decides whether to\ninitiate a formal hearing before a state Administrative Law Judge\n(ALJ), who will hear evidence and argument before issuing a written\ndecision. See §§24–34–306, 24–4–105(14). The decision of the ALJ\nmay be appealed to the full Commission, a seven-member appointed\nbody. The Commission holds a public hearing and deliberative\nsession before voting on the case. If the Commission determines\nthat the evidence proves a CADA violation, it may impose remedial\nmeasures as provided by statute. See §24–34–306(9). Available\nremedies include, among other things, orders to cease-and-desist a\ndiscriminatory policy, to file regular compliance reports with the\nCommission, and “to take affirmative action, including the posting\nof notices setting forth the substantive rights of the public.”\n§24–34–605. Colorado law does not permit the Commission to assess\nmoney damages or fines. §§24–34–306(9), 24–34–605. C Craig and Mullins filed a discrimination\ncomplaint against Masterpiece Cakeshop and Phillips in August 2012,\nshortly after the couple’s visit to the shop. App. 31. The\ncomplaint alleged that Craig and Mullins had been denied “full and\nequal service” at the bakery because of their sexual orientation, id. , at 35, 48, and that it was Phillips’ “standard business\npractice” not to provide cakes for same-sex weddings, id. ,\nat 43. The Civil Rights Division opened an\ninvestigation. The investigator found that “on multiple occasions,”\nPhillips “turned away potential customers on the basis of their\nsexual orientation, stating that he could not create a cake for a\nsame-sex wedding ceremony or reception” because his religious\nbeliefs prohibited it and because the potential customers “were\ndoing something illegal” at that time. Id. , at 76. The\ninvestigation found that Phillips had declined to sell custom\nwedding cakes to about six other same-sex couples on this basis. Id. , at 72. The investigator also recounted that, according\nto affidavits submitted by Craig and Mullins, Phillips’ shop had\nrefused to sell cupcakes to a lesbian couple for their commitment\ncelebration because the shop “had a policy of not selling baked\ngoods to same-sex couples for this type of event.” Id. , at\n73. Based on these findings, the Division found probable cause that\nPhillips violated CADA and referred the case to the Civil Rights\nCommission. Id. , at 69. The Commission found it proper to conduct a\nformal hearing, and it sent the case to a State ALJ. Finding no\ndispute as to material facts, the ALJ entertained cross-motions for\nsummary judgment and ruled in the couple’s favor. The ALJ first\nrejected Phillips’ argument that declining to make or create a\nwedding cake for Craig and Mullins did not violate Colorado law. It\nwas undisputed that the shop is subject to state public\naccommodations laws. And the ALJ determined that Phillips’ actions\nconstituted prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex- ual\norientation, not simply opposition to same-sex marriage as Phillips\ncontended. App. to Pet. for Cert. 68a–72a. Phillips raised two constitutional claims before\nthe ALJ. He first asserted that applying CADA in a way that would\nrequire him to create a cake for a same-sex wedding would violate\nhis First Amendment right to free speech by compelling him to\nexercise his artistic talents to express a message with which he\ndisagreed. The ALJ rejected the contention that preparing a wedding\ncake is a form of protected speech and did not agree that creating\nCraig and Mullins’ cake would force Phillips to adhere to “an\nideological point of view.” Id. , at 75a. Applying CADA to\nthe facts at hand, in the ALJ’s view, did not interfere with\nPhillips’ freedom of speech. Phillips also contended that requiring him to\ncreate cakes for same-sex weddings would violate his right to the\nfree exercise of religion, also protected by the First Amendment.\nCiting this Court’s precedent in Employment Div., Dept. of Human\nResources of Ore. v. Smith , 494 U. S. 872 (1990),\nthe ALJ determined that CADA is a “valid and neutral law of general\napplicability” and therefore that applying it to Phillips in this\ncase did not violate the Free Exercise Clause. Id ., at 879;\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 82a–83a. The ALJ thus ruled against Phillips\nand the cakeshop and in favor of Craig and Mullins on both\nconstitutional claims. The Commission affirmed the ALJ’s decision in\nfull. Id. , at 57a. The Commission ordered Phillips to “cease\nand desist from discriminating against . . . same-sex couples by\nrefusing to sell them wedding cakes or any product [they] would\nsell to heterosexual couples.” Ibid. It also ordered\nadditional remedial measures, including “comprehensive staff\ntraining on the Public Accommodations section” of CADA “and changes\nto any and all company policies to comply with . . . this\nOrder.” Id. , at 58a. The Commission additionally required\nPhillips to prepare “quarterly compliance reports” for a period of\ntwo years documenting “the number of patrons denied service” and\nwhy, along with “a statement describing the remedial actions\ntaken.” Ibid. Phillips appealed to the Colorado Court of\nAppeals, which affirmed the Commission’s legal determinations and\nremedial order. The court rejected the argument that the\n“Commission’s order unconstitutionally compels” Phillips and the\nshop “to convey a celebratory message about same sex marriage.” Craig v. Masterpiece Cakeshop, Inc. , 370 P. 3d\n272, 283 (2015). The court also rejected the argument that the\nCommission’s order violated the Free Exercise Clause. Relying on\nthis Court’s precedent in Smith , supra , at 879, the\ncourt stated that the Free Exercise Clause “does not relieve an\nindividual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law\nof general applicability” on the ground that following the law\nwould interfere with religious practice or belief. 370 P. 3d,\nat 289. The court concluded that requiring Phillips to comply with\nthe statute did not violate his free exercise rights. The Colorado\nSupreme Court declined to hear the case. Phillips sought review here, and this Court\ngranted certiorari. 582 U. S. ___ (2017). He now renews his\nclaims under the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the First\nAmendment. II A Our society has come to the recognition that\ngay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or\nas inferior in dignity and worth. For that reason the laws and the\nConstitution can, and in some instances must, protect them in the\nexercise of their civil rights. The exercise of their freedom on\nterms equal to others must be given great weight and respect by the\ncourts. At the same time, the religious and philosophical\nobjections to gay marriage are protected views and in some\ninstances protected forms of expression. As this Court observed in Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U. S. ___ (2015),\n“[t]he First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and\npersons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the\nprinciples that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and\nfaiths.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 27). Nevertheless, while\nthose religious and philosophical objections are protected, it is a\ngeneral rule that such objections do not allow business owners and\nother actors in the economy and in society to deny protected\npersons equal access to goods and services under a neutral and\ngenerally applicable public accommodations law. See Newman v. Piggy Park Enterprises, Inc. , 390 U. S. 400, 402, n.\n5 (1968) ( per curiam ); see also Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston,\nInc. , 515 U. S. 557, 572 (1995) (“Provisions like these\nare well within the State’s usual power to enact when a legislature\nhas reason to believe that a given group is the target of\ndiscrimination, and they do not, as a general matter, violate the\nFirst or Fourteenth Amendments”). When it comes to weddings, it can be assumed\nthat a member of the clergy who objects to gay marriage on moral\nand religious grounds could not be compelled to perform the\nceremony without denial of his or her right to the free exercise of\nreligion. This refusal would be well understood in our\nconstitutional order as an exercise of religion, an exercise that\ngay persons could recognize and accept without serious diminishment\nto their own dignity and worth. Yet if that exception were not\nconfined, then a long list of persons who provide goods and\nservices for marriages and weddings might refuse to do so for gay\npersons, thus resulting in a community-wide stigma inconsistent\nwith the history and dynamics of civil rights laws that ensure\nequal access to goods, services, and public accommodations. It is unexceptional that Colorado law can\nprotect gay persons, just as it can protect other classes of\nindividuals, in acquiring whatever products and services they\nchoose on the same terms and conditions as are offered to other\nmembers of the public. And there are no doubt innumerable goods and\nservices that no one could argue implicate the First Amendment.\nPetitioners conceded, moreover, that if a baker refused to sell any\ngoods or any cakes for gay weddings, that would be a different\nmatter and the State would have a strong case under this Court’s\nprecedents that this would be a denial of goods and services that\nwent beyond any protected rights of a baker who offers goods and\nservices to the general public and is subject to a neutrally\napplied and generally applicable public accommodations law. See Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 4–7, 10. Phillips claims, however, that a narrower issue\nis presented. He argues that he had to use his artistic skills to\nmake an expressive statement, a wedding endorsement in his own\nvoice and of his own creation. As Phillips would see the case, this\ncontention has a significant First Amendment speech component and\nimplicates his deep and sincere religious beliefs. In this context\nthe baker likely found it difficult to find a line where the\ncustomers’ rights to goods and services became a demand for him to\nexercise the right of his own personal expression for their\nmessage, a message he could not express in a way consistent with\nhis religious beliefs. Phillips’ dilemma was particularly\nunderstandable given the background of legal principles and\nadministration of the law in Colorado at that time. His decision\nand his actions leading to the refusal of service all occurred in\nthe year 2012. At that point, Colorado did not recognize the\nvalidity of gay marriages performed in its own State. See Colo.\nConst., Art. II, §31 (2012); 370 P. 3d, at 277. At the\ntime of the events in question, this Court had not issued its\ndecisions either in United States v. Windsor , 570\nU. S. 744 (2013), or Obergefell . Since the State itself\ndid not allow those marriages to be performed in Colorado, there is\nsome force to the argument that the baker was not unreasonable in\ndeeming it lawful to decline to take an action that he understood\nto be an expression of support for their validity when that\nexpression was contrary to his sincerely held religious beliefs, at\nleast insofar as his refusal was limited to refusing to create and\nexpress a message in support of gay marriage, even one planned to\ntake place in another State. At the time, state law also afforded\nstorekeepers some latitude to decline to create specific messages\nthe storekeeper considered offensive. Indeed, while enforcement\nproceedings against Phillips were ongoing, the Colorado Civil\nRights Division itself endorsed this proposition in cases involving\nother bakers’ creation of cakes, concluding on at least three\noccasions that a baker acted lawfully in declining to create cakes\nwith decorations that demeaned gay persons or gay marriages. See Jack v. Gateaux, Ltd. , Charge No. P20140071X (Mar.\n24, 2015); Jack v. Le Bakery Sensual, Inc. , Charge\nNo. P20140070X (Mar. 24, 2015); Jack v. Azucar\nBakery , Charge No. P20140069X (Mar. 24, 2015). There were, to be sure, responses to these\narguments that the State could make when it contended for a\ndifferent result in seeking the enforcement of its generally\napplicable state regulations of businesses that serve the public.\nAnd any decision in favor of the baker would have to be\nsufficiently constrained, lest all purveyors of goods and services\nwho object to gay marriages for moral and religious reasons in\neffect be allowed to put up signs saying “no goods or services will\nbe sold if they will be used for gay marriages,” something that\nwould impose a serious stigma on gay persons. But, nonetheless,\nPhillips was entitled to the neutral and respectful consideration\nof his claims in all the circumstances of the case. B The neutral and respectful consideration to\nwhich Phillips was entitled was compromised here, however. The\nCivil Rights Commission’s treatment of his case has some elements\nof a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious\nbeliefs that motivated his objection. That hostility surfaced at the Commission’s\nformal, public hearings, as shown by the record. On May 30, 2014,\nthe seven-member Commission convened publicly to consider Phillips’\ncase. At several points during its meeting, commissioners endorsed\nthe view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into\nthe public sphere or commercial domain, implying that religious\nbeliefs and persons are less than fully welcome in Colorado’s\nbusiness community. One commissioner suggested that Phillips can\nbelieve “what he wants to believe,” but cannot act on his religious\nbeliefs “if he decides to do business in the state.” Tr. 23. A few\nmoments later, the commissioner restated the same position: “[I]f a\nbusinessman wants to do business in the state and he’s got an issue\nwith the—the law’s impacting his personal belief system, he needs\nto look at being able to compromise.” Id ., at 30. Standing\nalone, these statements are susceptible of different\ninterpretations. On the one hand, they might mean simply that a\nbusiness cannot refuse to provide services based on sexual\norientation, regardless of the proprietor’s personal views. On the\nother hand, they might be seen as inappropriate and dismissive\ncomments showing lack of due consideration for Phillips’ free\nexercise rights and the dilemma he faced. In view of the comments\nthat followed, the latter seems the more likely. On July 25, 2014, the Commission met again. This\nmeeting, too, was conducted in public and on the record. On this\noccasion another commissioner made specific reference to the\nprevious meeting’s discussion but said far more to disparage\nPhillips’ beliefs. The commissioner stated: “I would also like to reiterate what we said in\nthe hearing or the last meeting. Freedom of religion and religion\nhas been used to justify all kinds of discrimination throughout\nhistory, whether it be slavery, whether it be the holocaust,\nwhether it be—I mean, we—we can list hundreds of situations where\nfreedom of religion has been used to justify discrimination. And to\nme it is one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people\ncan use to—to use their religion to hurt others.” Tr. 11–12. To describe a man’s faith as “one of the most\ndespicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use” is to disparage\nhis religion in at least two distinct ways: by describing it as\ndespicable, and also by characterizing it as merely\nrhetorical—something insubstantial and even insincere. The\ncommissioner even went so far as to compare Phillips’ invocation of\nhis sincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the\nHolocaust. This sentiment is inappropriate for a Commission charged\nwith the solemn responsibility of fair and neutral enforcement of\nColorado’s antidiscrimination law—a law that protects\ndiscrimination on the basis of religion as well as sexual\norientation. The record shows no objection to these comments\nfrom other commissioners. And the later state-court ruling\nreviewing the Commission’s decision did not mention those comments,\nmuch less",

Wesby et al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the district of columbia circuit No. 15–1485. Argued October 4, 2017—Decided\nJanuary 22, 2018 District of Columbia police officers responded\nto a complaint about loud music and illegal activities in a vacant\nhouse. Inside, they found the house nearly barren and in disarray.\nThe officers smelled marijuana and observed beer bottles and cups\nof liquor on the floor, which was dirty. They found a make-shift\nstrip club in the living room, and a naked woman and several men in\nan upstairs bedroom. Many party- goers scattered when they saw the\nuniformed officers, and some hid. The officers questioned everyone\nand got inconsistent stories. Two women identified “Peaches” as the\nhouse’s tenant and said that she had given the partygoers\npermission to have the party. But Peaches was not there. When the\nofficers spoke by phone to Peaches, she was nervous, agitated, and\nevasive. At first, she claimed that she was renting the house and\nhad given the partygoers permission to have the party, but she\neventually admitted that she did not have permission to use the\nhouse. The owner confirmed that he had not given anyone permission\nto be there. The officers then arrested the partygoers for unlawful\nentry. Several partygoers sued for false arrest under\nthe Fourth Amendment and District law. The District Court concluded\nthat the officers lacked probable cause to arrest the partygoers\nfor unlawful entry and that two of the officers, petitioners here,\nwere not entitled to qualified immunity. A divided panel of the\nD. C. Circuit affirmed. Held : 1. The officers had probable cause to\narrest the partygoers. Pp. 7–13. (a) Considering the “totality of the\ncircumstances,” Maryland v. Pringle , 540 U. S.\n366 , the officers made an “entirely reasonable inference” that the\npartygoers knew they did not have permission to be in the house, id. , at 372. Taken together, the condition of the house and\nthe conduct of the partygoers allowed the officers to make several\n“ ‘common-sense conclusions about human behavior.’ ” Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213 . Because most\nhomeowners do not live in such conditions or permit such activities\nin their homes, the officers could infer that the partygoers knew\nthe party was not authorized. The officers also could infer that\nthe partygoers knew that they were not supposed to be in the house\nbecause they scattered and hid when the officers arrived. See Illinois v. Wardlow , 528 U. S. 119 –125. The\npartygoers’ vague and implausible answers to questioning also gave\nthe officers reason to infer that the partygoers were lying and\nthat their lies suggested a guilty mind. Cf. Devenpeck v. Alford , 543 U. S. 146 –156. Peaches’ lying and evasive\nbehavior gave the officers reason to discredit everything she said.\nThe officers also could have inferred that she lied when she said\nshe had invited the partygoers to the house, or that she told the\npartygoers that she was not actually renting the house.\nPp. 7–11. (b) The panel majority failed to follow two\nbasic and well-established principles of law. First, it viewed each\nfact “in isolation, rather than as a factor in the totality of the\ncircumstances.” Pringle , supra , at 372, n. 2.\nSecond, it believed that it could dismiss outright any\ncircumstances that were “susceptible of innocent explanation,” United States v. Arvizu , 534 U. S. 266 .\nInstead, it should have asked whether a reasonable officer could\nconclude—considering all of the surrounding circumstances,\nincluding the plausibility of the explanation itself—that there was\na “substantial chance of criminal activity,” Gates, supra, at 244, n. 13. Pp. 11–13. 2. The officers are entitled to qualified\nimmunity. Pp. 13–19. (a) As relevant here, officers are\nentitled to qualified immunity under 42 U. S. C. §1983\nunless the unlawfulness of their conduct was “clearly established\nat the time,” Reichle v. Howards , 566 U. S. 658 . To\nbe clearly established, a legal principle must be “settled law,” Hunter v. Bryant , 502 U. S. 224 , and it must\nclearly prohibit the officer’s conduct in the particular\ncircumstances before him, see Saucier v. Katz , 533\nU. S. 194 . In the warrantless arrest context, “a body of\nrelevant case law” is usually necessary to “ ‘clearly\nestablish’ the answer” with respect to probable cause. Brosseau v. Haugen , 543 U. S. 194 . Even assuming that the officers lacked actual\nprobable cause to arrest the partygoers, they are entitled to\nqualified immunity because, given “the circumstances with which\n[they] w[ere] confronted,” they “reasonably but mistakenly\nconclude[d] that probable cause [wa]s present.” Anderson v. Creighton , 483 U. S. 635 . The panel majority and the\npartygoers have failed to identify a single precedent finding a\nFourth Amendment violation “under similar circumstances.” White v . Pauly, 580 U. S. ___, ___. And this is\nnot an “obvious case” where “a body of relevant case law” is\nunnecessary. Brosseau, supra , at 199. Pp. 13–16. (b) Instead of following this\nstraightforward analysis, the panel majority reasoned that, under\nclearly established District law, a suspect’s bona fide belief of a\nright to enter vitiates probable cause to arrest for unlawful\nentry. Thus, it concluded that the “uncontroverted evidence” of an\ninvitation in this case meant that the officers could not infer the\npartygoers’ intent from other circumstances or disbelieve their\nstory. But looking at the entire legal landscape at the time of the\narrests, a reasonable officer could have interpreted the law as\npermitting the arrests here. There was no controlling case holding\nthat a bona fide belief of a right to enter defeats probable cause,\nthat officers cannot infer a suspect’s guilty state of mind based\non his conduct alone, or that officers must accept a suspect’s\ninnocent explanation at face value. And several precedents\nsuggested the opposite. Pp. 16–19. 765 F. 3d 13, reversed and remanded. Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Kennedy, Breyer, Alito,\nKagan, and Gorsuch, JJ., joined. Sotomayor, J., filed an opinion\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Ginsburg, J.,\nfiled an opinion concurring in the judgment in part.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 15–1485 _________________ DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, et al., PETITIONERS v. THEODORE WESBY, et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the district of columbia circuit [January 22, 2018] Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. This case involves a civil suit against the\nDistrict of Columbia and five of its police officers, brought by 16\nindividuals who were arrested for holding a raucous, late-night\nparty in a house they did not have permission to enter. The United\nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held\nthat there was no probable cause to arrest the partygoers, and that\nthe officers were not entitled to qualified immunity. We reverse on\nboth grounds. I Around 1 a.m. on March 16, 2008, the\nDistrict’s Metropolitan Police Department received a complaint\nabout loud music and illegal activities at a house in Northeast\nD. C. The caller, a former neighborhood commissioner, told\npolice that the house had been vacant for several months. When\nofficers arrived at the scene, several neighbors confirmed that the\nhouse should have been empty. The officers approached the house\nand, consistent with the complaint, heard loud music playing\ninside. After the officers knocked on the front door,\nthey saw a man look out the window and then run upstairs. One of\nthe partygoers opened the door, and the officers entered. They\nimmediately observed that the inside of the house “ ‘was in\ndisarray’ ” and looked like “ ‘a vacant property.’ ”\n841 F. Supp. 2d 20, 31 (DC 2012) (quoting Defs. Exh. A). The\nofficers smelled marijuana and saw beer bottles and cups of liquor\non the floor. In fact, the floor was so dirty that one of the\npartygoers refused to sit on it while being questioned. Although\nthe house had working electricity and plumbing, it had no furniture\ndownstairs other than a few padded metal chairs. The only other\nsigns of habitation were blinds on the windows, food in the\nrefrigerator, and toiletries in the bathroom. In the living room, the officers found a\nmakeshift strip club. Several women were wearing only bras and\nthongs, with cash tucked into their garter belts. The women were\ngiving lap dances while other partygoers watched. Most of the\nonlookers were holding cash and cups of alcohol. After seeing the\nuniformed officers, many partygoers scattered into other parts of\nthe house. The officers found more debauchery upstairs. A\nnaked woman and several men were in the bedroom. A bare\nmattress—the only one in the house—was on the floor, along with\nsome lit candles and multiple open condom wrappers. A used condom\nwas on the windowsill. The officers found one partygoer hiding in\nan upstairs closet, and another who had shut himself in the\nbathroom and refused to come out. The officers found a total of 21 people in the\nhouse. After interviewing all 21, the officers did not get a clear\nor consistent story. Many partygoers said they were there for a\nbachelor party, but no one could identify the bachelor. Each of the\npartygoers claimed that someone had invited them to the house, but\nno one could say who. Two of the women working the party said that\na woman named “Peaches” or “Tasty” was renting the house and had\ngiven them permission to be there. One of the women explained that\nthe previous owner had recently passed away, and Peaches had just\nstarted renting the house from the grandson who inherited it. But\nthe house had no boxes or moving supplies. She did not know\nPeaches’ real name. And Peaches was not there. An officer asked the woman to call Peaches on\nher phone so he could talk to her. Peaches answered and explained\nthat she had just left the party to go to the store. When the\nofficer asked her to return, Peaches refused because she was afraid\nof being arrested. The sergeant supervising the investigation also\nspoke with Peaches. At first, Peaches claimed to be renting the\nhouse from the owner, who was fixing it up for her. She also said\nthat she had given the attendees permission to have the party. When\nthe sergeant again asked her who had given her permission to use\nthe house, Peaches became evasive and hung up. The sergeant called\nher back, and she began yelling and insisting that she had\npermission before hanging up a second time. The officers eventually\ngot Peaches on the phone again, and she admitted that she did not\nhave permission to use the house. The officers then contacted the owner. He told\nthem that he had been trying to negotiate a lease with Peaches, but\nthey had not reached an agreement. He confirmed that he had not\ngiven Peaches (or anyone else) permission to be in the house—let\nalone permission to use it for a bachelor party. At that point, the\nofficers arrested the 21 partygoers for unlawful entry. See\nD. C. Code §22–3302 (2008). The police transported the\npartygoers to the police station, where the lieutenant decided to\ncharge them with disorderly conduct. See §22–1321. The partygoers\nwere released, and the charges were eventually dropped.[ 1 ] II Respondents, 16 of the 21 partygoers, sued the\nDistrict and five of the arresting officers. They sued the officers\nfor false arrest under the Fourth Amendment, Rev. Stat. §1979, 42\nU. S. C. §1983, and under District law. They sued the\nDistrict for false arrest and negligent supervision under District\nlaw. The partygoers’ claims were all “predicated upon the\nallegation that [they] were arrested without probable cause.” 841\nF. Supp. 2d, at 32. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the\nDistrict Court awarded partial summary judgment to the party-\ngoers. Id. , at 48–49. It concluded that the officers lacked\nprobable cause to arrest the partygoers for unlawful\nentry.[ 2 ] Id., at 32–33.\nThe officers were told that Peaches had invited the partygoers to\nthe house, the District Court reasoned, and nothing the officers\nlearned in their investigation suggested the partygoers\n“ ‘knew or should have known that [they were] entering against\nthe [owner’s] will.’ ” Id. , at 32. The District Court\nalso concluded that the officers were not entitled to qualified\nimmunity under §1983.[ 3 ] It\nnoted that, under District case law, “probable cause to arrest for\nunlawful entry requires evidence that the alleged intruder knew or\nshould have known, upon entry, that such entry was against the will\nof the owner.” Id. , at 37. And in its view, the officers had\nno such evidence. Id., at 32–33, 37–38. With liability resolved, the case proceeded to\ntrial on damages. The jury awarded the partygoers a total of\n$680,000 in compensatory damages. After the District Court awarded\nattorney’s fees, the total award was nearly $1 million. On appeal, a divided panel of the D. C.\nCircuit affirmed. On the question of probable cause, the panel\nmajority made Peaches’ invitation “central” to its determination\nthat the officers lacked probable cause to arrest the party- goers\nfor unlawful entry. 765 F. 3d 13, 21 (2014). The panel\nmajority asserted that, “in the absence of any conflicting\ninformation, Peaches’ invitation vitiates the necessary element of\n[the partygoers’] intent to enter against the will of the lawful\nowner.” Ibid. And the panel major- ity determined that\n“there is simply no evidence in the record that [the partygoers]\nhad any reason to think the invitation was invalid.” Ibid. On the question of qualified immunity, the panel\nmajority determined that it was “perfectly clear” that a person\nwith “a good purpose and bona fide belief of her right to enter”\nlacks the necessary intent for unlawful entry. Id. , at 27.\nIn other words, the officers needed “some evidence” that the\npartygoers “knew or should have known they were entering against\nthe will of the lawful owner.” Ibid. And here, the panel\nmajority asserted, the officers must “have known that\nuncontroverted evidence of an invitation to enter the premises\nwould vitiate probable cause for unlawful entry.” Ibid. Judge Brown dissented. She concluded that\nsummary judgment on the false-arrest claims was improper because,\nunder the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable officer\n“could disbelieve [the partygoers’] claim of innocent entry” and\ninfer that they knew or should have known that they did not have\npermission to be in the house. Id. , at 34. She also\ndisagreed with the denial of qualified immunity, contending that a\nreasonable officer could have found probable cause to arrest in\nthis “unusual factual scenario, not well represented in the\ncontrolling case law.” Id. , at 36. The D. C. Circuit denied rehearing en banc\nover the dissent of four judges. The dissenters focused on\nqualified immunity, contending that the panel opinion\n“contravene[d] . . . emphatic Supreme Court\ndirectives” that “police officers may not be held liable for\ndamages unless the officers were ‘plainly incompetent’ or\n‘knowingly violate[d]’ clearly established law.” 816 F. 3d 96,\n102 (2016) (quoting Carroll v. Carman, 574 U. S.\n___, ___ (2014) ( per curiam ) (slip op., at 4)). The panel\nmajority— Judges Pillard and Edwards—responded in a joint\nconcurrence. 816 F. 3d, at 96–101. They insisted that the\npanel opinion did not misapply the law of qualified immunity, and\nthat their disagreement with the dissenters was a mere\n“case-specific assessment of the circumstantial evidence in the\nrecord.” Id., at 100. We granted certiorari to resolve two questions:\nwhether the officers had probable cause to arrest the partygoers,\nand whether the officers were entitled to qualified immunity. See\n580 U. S. ___ (2017). We address each question in turn. III The Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of\nthe people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and\neffects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” Because\narrests are “seizures” of “persons,” they must be reasonable under\nthe circumstances. See Payton v. New York , 445\nU. S. 573, 585 (1980) . A warrantless arrest is reasonable if\nthe officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect\ncommitted a crime in the officer’s presence. Atwater v. Lago Vista , 532 U. S. 318, 354 (2001) . To determine whether an officer had probable\ncause for an arrest, “we examine the events leading up to the\narrest, and then decide ‘whether these historical facts, viewed\nfrom the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer,\namount to’ probable cause.” Maryland v. Pringle , 540\nU. S. 366, 371 (2003) (quoting Ornelas v. United\nStates , 517 U. S. 690, 696 (1996) ). Because probable\ncause “deals with probabilities and depends on the totality of the\ncircumstances,” 540 U. S., at 371, it is “a fluid concept”\nthat is “not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of\nlegal rules,” Illinois v. Gates , 462 U. S. 213,\n232 (1983) . It “requires only a probability or substantial chance\nof criminal activity, not an actual showing of such activity.” Id. , at 243–244, n. 13 (1983). Probable cause “is not a\nhigh bar.” Kaley v. United States , 571 U. S.\n___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 18). A There is no dispute that the partygoers\nentered the house against the will of the owner. Nonetheless, the\npartygoers contend that the officers lacked probable cause to\narrest them because the officers had no reason to believe that they\n“knew or should have known” their “entry was unwanted.” Ortberg v. United States , 81 A. 3d 303, 308\n(D. C. 2013). We disagree. Considering the totality of the\ncircumstances, the officers made an “entirely reason- able\ninference” that the partygoers were knowingly taking advantage of a\nvacant house as a venue for their late-night party. Pringle , supra , at 372. Consider first the condition of the house.\nMultiple neighbors, including a former neighborhood official,\ninformed the officers that the house had been vacant for several\nmonths.[ 4 ] The house had no\nfurniture, except for a few padded metal chairs and a bare\nmattress. The rest of the house was empty, save for some fixtures\nand large appliances. The house had a few signs of\ninhabitance—working electricity and plumbing, blinds on the\nwindows, toiletries in the bathroom, and food in the refrigerator.\nBut those facts are not necessarily inconsistent with the house\nbeing unoccupied. The owner could have paid the utilities and kept\nthe blinds while he looked for a new tenant, and the partygoers\ncould have brought the food and toiletries. Although one woman told\nthe officers that Peaches had recently moved in, the officers had\nreason to doubt that was true. There were no boxes or other moving\nsupplies in the house; nor were there other possessions, such as\nclothes in the closet, suggesting someone lived there. In addition to the condition of the house,\nconsider the partygoers’ conduct. The party was still going strong\nwhen the officers arrived after 1 a.m., with music so loud that it\ncould be heard from outside. Upon entering the house, multiple\nofficers smelled marijuana.[ 5 ]\nThe party- goers left beer bottles and cups of liquor on the floor,\nand they left the floor so dirty that one of them refused to sit on\nit. The living room had been converted into a makeshift strip club.\nStrippers in bras and thongs, with cash stuffed in their garter\nbelts, were giving lap dances. Upstairs, the officers found a group\nof men with a single, naked woman on a bare mattress—the only bed\nin the house—along with multiple open condom wrappers and a used\ncondom. Taken together, the condition of the house and\nthe conduct of the partygoers allowed the officers to make several\n“ ‘common-sense conclusions about human behavior.’ ” Gates , supra , at 231 (quoting United States v. Cortez , 449 U. S. 411, 418 (1981) ). Most homeowners do\nnot live in near-barren houses. And most homeowners do not invite\npeople over to use their living room as a strip club, to have sex\nin their bedroom, to smoke marijuana inside, and to leave their\nfloors filthy. The officers could thus infer that the partygoers\nknew their party was not authorized. The partygoers’ reaction to the officers gave\nthem further reason to believe that the partygoers knew they lacked\npermission to be in the house. Many scattered at the sight of the\nuniformed officers. Two hid themselves, one in a closet and the\nother in a bathroom. “[U]nprovoked flight upon noticing the\npolice,” we have explained, “is certainly suggestive” of wrongdoing\nand can be treated as “suspicious behavior” that factors into the\ntotality of the circumstances. Illinois v. Wardlow ,\n528 U. S. 119 –125 (2000). In fact, “deliberately furtive\nactions and flight at the approach of . . . law officers\nare strong indicia of mens rea. ” Sibron v. New York , 392 U. S. 40, 66 (1968) (emphasis added). A\nreasonable officer could infer that the partygoers’ scattering and\nhiding was an indication that they knew they were not supposed to\nbe there. The partygoers’ answers to the officers’\nquestions also suggested their guilty state of mind. When the\nofficers asked who had given them permission to be there, the\npartygoers gave vague and implausible responses. They could not say\nwho had invited them. Only two people claimed that Peaches had\ninvited them, and they were working the party instead of attending\nit. If Peaches was the hostess, it was odd that none of the\npartygoers mentioned her name. Additionally, some of the partygoers\nclaimed the event was a bachelor party, but no one could identify\nthe bachelor. The officers could have disbelieved them, since\npeople normally do not throw a bachelor party without a bachelor.\nBased on the vagueness and implausibility of the partygoers’\nstories, the officers could have reasonably inferred that they were\nlying and that their lies suggested a guilty mind. Cf. Devenpeck v. Alford , 543 U. S. 146 –156 (2004)\n(noting that the suspect’s “untruthful and evasive” answers to\npolice questioning could support probable cause). The panel majority relied heavily on the fact\nthat Peaches said she had invited the partygoers to the house. But\nwhen the officers spoke with Peaches, she was nervous, agitated,\nand evasive. Cf. Wardlow , supra , at 124 (explaining\nthat the police can take a suspect’s “nervous, evasive behavior”\ninto account). After initially insisting that she had permission to\nuse the house, she ultimately confessed that this was a lie—a fact\nthat the owner confirmed. Peaches’ lying and evasive behavior gave\nthe officers reason to discredit everything she had told them. For\nexample, the officers could have inferred that Peaches lied to them\nwhen she said she had invited the others to the house, which was\nconsistent with the fact that hardly anyone at the party knew her\nname. Or the officers could have inferred that Peaches told the\npartygoers (like she eventually told the police) that she was not\nactually renting the house, which was consistent with how the\nparty- goers were treating it. Viewing these circumstances as a whole, a\nreasonable officer could conclude that there was probable cause to\nbelieve the partygoers knew they did not have permission to be in\nthe house. B In concluding otherwise, the panel majority\nengaged in an “excessively technical dissection” of the factors\nsupporting probable cause. Gates , 462 U. S., at 234.\nIndeed, the panel majority failed to follow two basic and\nwell-established principles of law. First, the panel majority viewed each fact “in\nisolation, rather than as a factor in the totality of the\ncircumstances.” Pringle , 540 U. S., at 372, n. 2.\nThis was “mistaken in light of our precedents.” Ibid. The\n“totality of the circumstances” requires courts to consider “the\nwhole picture.” Cortez , supra, at 417. Our precedents\nrecognize that the whole is often greater than the sum of its\nparts—especially when the parts are viewed in isolation. See United States v. Arvizu , 534 U. S. 266 –278\n(2002). Instead of considering the facts as a whole, the panel\nmajority took them one by one. For example, it dismissed the fact\nthat the partygoers “scattered or hid when the police entered the\nhouse” because that fact was “not sufficient standing alone to create probable cause.” 765 F. 3d, at 23 (emphasis added).\nSimilarly, it found “nothing in the record suggesting that the\ncondition of the house, on its own , should have alerted the\n[partygoers] that they were unwelcome.” Ibid. (emphasis\nadded). The totality-of-the-circumstances test “precludes this sort\nof divide-and-conquer analysis.” Arvizu , 534 U. S., at\n274. Second, the panel majority mistakenly believed\nthat it could dismiss outright any circumstances that were\n“susceptible of innocent explanation.” Id., at 277. For\nexample, the panel majority brushed aside the drinking and the lap\ndances as “consistent with” the partygoers’ explanation that they\nwere having a bachelor party. 765 F. 3d, at 23. And it\nsimilarly dismissed the condition of the house as “entirely\nconsistent with” Peaches being a “new tenant.” Ibid. But\nprobable cause does not require officers to rule out a suspect’s\ninnocent explanation for suspicious facts. As we have explained,\n“the relevant inquiry is not whether particular conduct is\n‘innocent’ or ‘guilty,’ but the degree of suspicion that attaches\nto particular types of noncriminal acts.” Gates , 462\nU. S., at 244, n. 13. Thus, the panel majority should\nhave asked whether a reasonable officer could conclude—considering\nall of the surrounding circumstances, including the plausibility of\nthe explanation itself—that there was a “substantial chance of\ncriminal activity.” Ibid. The circumstances here certainly suggested\ncriminal activity. As explained, the officers found a group of\npeople who claimed to be having a bachelor party with no bachelor,\nin a near-empty house, with strippers in the living room and sexual\nactivity in the bedroom, and who fled at the first sign of police.\nThe panel majority identified innocent explanations for most of\nthese circumstances in isolation, but again, this kind of\ndivide-and-conquer approach is improper. A factor viewed in\nisolation is often more “readily susceptible to an innocent\nexplanation” than one viewed as part of a totality. Arvizu , supra , at 274. And here, the totality of the circumstances\ngave the officers plenty of reasons to doubt the partygoers’\nprotestations of innocence. For all of these reasons, we reverse the\nD. C. Circuit’s holding that the officers lacked probable\ncause to arrest. Accordingly, the District and its officers are\nentitled to summary judgment on all of the partygoers’\nclaims.[ 6 ] IV Our conclusion that the officers had probable\ncause to arrest the partygoers is sufficient to resolve this case.\nBut where, as here, the Court of Appeals erred on both the merits\nof the constitutional claim and the question of qualified immunity,\n“we have discretion to correct its errors at each step.” Ashcroft v. al-Kidd , 563 U. S. 731, 735 (2011) ;\nsee, e.g., Plumhoff v. Rickard , 572 U. S. ___\n(2014). We exercise that discretion here because the D. C.\nCircuit’s analysis, if followed elsewhere, would “undermine the\nvalues qualified immunity seeks to promote.” al-Kidd , supra , at 735.[ 7 ] A Under our precedents, officers are entitled to\nqualified immunity under §1983 unless (1) they violated a\nfederal statutory or constitutional right, and (2) the\nunlawfulness of their conduct was “clearly established at the\ntime.” Reichle v. Howards , 566 U. S. 658, 664\n(2012) . “Clearly established” means that, at the time of the\nofficer’s conduct, the law was “ ‘sufficiently clear’ that\nevery ‘reason- able official would understand that what he is\ndoing’ ” is unlawful. al-Kidd , supra, at 741\n(quoting Anderson v. Creighton , 483 U. S. 635,\n640 (1987) ). In other words, existing law must have placed the\nconstitutionality of the officer’s conduct “beyond debate.” al-Kidd , supra , at 741. This demanding standard\nprotects “all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly\nviolate the law.” Malley v. Briggs , 475 U. S.\n335, 341 (1986) . To be clearly established, a legal principle\nmust have a sufficiently clear foundation in then-existing\nprecedent. The rule must be “settled law,” Hunter v. Bryant , 502 U. S. 224, 228 (1991) ( per curiam ),\nwhich means it is dictated by “controlling authority” or “a robust\n‘consensus of cases of persuasive authority,’ ” al-Kidd , supra , at 741–742 (quoting Wilson v. Layne , 526 U. S. 603, 617 (1999) ). It is not enough\nthat the rule is suggested by then-existing precedent. The\nprecedent must be clear enough that every reasonable official would\ninterpret it to establish the particular rule the plaintiff seeks\nto apply. See Reichle , 566 U. S., at 666. Otherwise,\nthe rule is not one that “every reasonable official” would know. Id. , at 664 (internal quotation marks omitted). The “clearly established” standard also requires\nthat the legal principle clearly prohibit the officer’s conduct in\nthe particular circumstances before him. The rule’s contours must\nbe so well defined that it is “clear to a reasonable officer that\nhis conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.” Saucier v. Katz , 533 U. S. 194, 202 (2001) .\nThis requires a high “degree of specificity.” Mullenix v. Luna , 577 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) ( per curiam )\n(slip op., at 6). We have repeatedly stressed that courts must not\n“define clearly established law at a high level of generality,\nsince doing so avoids the crucial question whether the official\nacted reasonably in the particular circumstances that he or she\nfaced.” Plumhoff , supra, at ___–___ (slip op., at\n12–13) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A rule is\ntoo general if the unlawfulness of the officer’s conduct “does not\nfollow immediately from the conclusion that [the rule] was firmly\nestablished.” Anderson , supra , at 641. In the context\nof a warrantless arrest, the rule must obviously resolve “whether\n‘the circumstances with which [the particular officer] was\nconfronted . . . constitute[d] probable cause.’ ” Mullenix , supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6) (quoting Anderson , supra , at 640–641; some alterations in\noriginal). We have stressed that the “specificity” of the\nrule is “especially important in the Fourth Amendment context.” Mullenix, supra , at ___ (slip op., at 5). Probable cause\n“turn[s] on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual\ncontexts” and cannot be “reduced to a neat set of legal rules.” Gates , 462 U. S., at 232. It is “incapable of precise\ndefinition or quantification into percentages.” Pringle , 540\nU. S., at 371. Given its imprecise nature, officers will often\nfind it difficult to know how the general standard of probable\ncause applies in “the precise situation encountered.” Ziglar v. Abbasi , 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 28).\nThus, we have stressed the need to “identify a case where an\nofficer acting under similar circumstances . . . was held\nto have violated the Fourth Amendment.” White v. Pauly , 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) ( per curiam )\n(slip op., at 6); e.g., Plumhoff , supra, at ___.\nWhile there does not have to be “a case directly on point,”\nexisting precedent must place the lawfulness of the particular\narrest “beyond debate.” al-Kidd , supra , at 741. Of\ncourse, there can be the rare “obvious case,” where the\nunlawfulness of the officer’s conduct is sufficiently clear even\nthough existing precedent does not address similar circumstances. Brosseau v. Haugen , 543 U. S. 194, 199 (2004)\n( per curiam ). But “a body of relevant case law” is usually\nnecessary to “ ‘clearly establish’ the answer” with respect to\nprobable cause. Ibid. Under these principles, we readily conclude that\nthe officers here were entitled to qualified immunity. We start by\ndefining “the circumstances with which [the officers] w[ere]\nconfronted.” Anderson , 483 U. S., at 640. The officers\nfound a group of people in a house that the neighbors had\nidentified as vacant, that appeared to be vacant, and that the\npartygoers were treating as vacant. The group scattered, and some\nhid, at the sight of law enforcement. Their explanations for being\nat the house were full of holes. The source of their claimed\ninvitation admitted that she had no right to be in the house, and\nthe owner confirmed that fact. Even a",

    "fulltext": " SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES KEITH THARPE v. ERIC SELLERS,\nWARDEN on petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit No. 17–6075. Decided January 8, 2018 Per Curiam. Petitioner Keith Tharpe moved to reopen his\nfederal habeas corpus proceedings regarding his claim that the\nGeorgia jury that convicted him of murder included a white juror,\nBarney Gattie, who was biased against Tharpe because he is black.\nSee Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(6). The District Court denied the\nmotion on the ground that, among other things, Tharpe’s claim was\nprocedurally defaulted in state court. The District Court also\nnoted that Tharpe could not overcome that procedural default\nbecause he had failed to produce any clear and convincing evidence\ncontradicting the state court’s determination that Gattie’s\npresence on the jury did not prejudice him. See Tharpe v. Warden , No. 5:10–cv–433 (MD Ga., Sept. 5, 2017), App. B to\nPet. for Cert. 19. Tharpe sought a certificate of appealability\n(COA). The Eleventh Circuit denied his COA application after\ndeciding that jurists of reason could not dispute that the District\nCourt’s procedural ruling was correct. See Tharpe v. Warden , 2017 WL 4250413, *3 (Sept. 21, 2017). The Eleventh\nCircuit’s decision, as we read it, was based solely on its\nconclusion, rooted in the state court’s factfinding, that Tharpe\nhad failed to show prejudice in connection with his procedurally\ndefaulted claim, i.e. , that Tharpe had “failed to\ndemonstrate that Barney Gattie’s behavior ‘had substantial and\ninjurious effect or influence in determining the jury’s\nverdict.’ ” Ibid. (quoting Brecht v. Abrahamson , 507 U. S. 619, 637 (1993) ). Our review of the record compels a different\nconclusion. The state court’s prejudice determination rested on its\nfinding that Gattie’s vote to impose the death penalty was not\nbased on Tharpe’s race. See Tharpe v. Warden , No.\n93–cv–144 (Super. Ct. Butts Cty., Ga., Dec. 1, 2008), App. F to\nPet. for Cert. 102. And that factual determination is binding on\nfederal courts, including this Court, in the absence of clear and\nconvincing evidence to the contrary. See 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(e)(1). Here, however, Tharpe produced a sworn affidavit,\nsigned by Gattie, indicating Gattie’s view that “there are two\ntypes of black people: 1. Black folks and 2. Niggers”; that Tharpe,\n“who wasn’t in the ‘good’ black folks category in my book, should\nget the electric chair for what he did”; that “[s]ome of the jurors\nvoted for death because they felt Tharpe should be an example to\nother blacks who kill blacks, but that wasn’t my reason”; and that,\n“[a]fter studying the Bible, I have wondered if black people even\nhave souls.” App. B to Pet. for Cert. 15–16 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Gattie’s remarkable affidavit—which he never\nretracted—presents a strong factual basis for the argument that\nTharpe’s race affected Gattie’s vote for a death verdict. At the\nvery least, jurists of reason could debate whether Tharpe has shown\nby clear and convincing evidence that the state court’s factual\ndetermination was wrong. The Eleventh Circuit erred when it\nconcluded otherwise. The question of prejudice—the ground on which\nthe Eleventh Circuit chose to dispose of Tharpe’s application—is\nnot the only question relevant to the broader inquiry whether\nTharpe should receive a COA. The District Court denied Tharpe’s\nRule 60(b) motion on several grounds not addressed by the Eleventh\nCircuit. We express no view of those issues here. In light of the\nstandard for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(6), which is\navailable only in “ ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ ” Gonzalez v. Crosby , 545 U. S. 524, 536 (2005) ,\nTharpe faces a high bar in showing that jurists of reason could\ndisagree whether the District Court abused its discretion in\ndenying his motion. It may be that, at the end of the day, Tharpe\nshould not receive a COA. And review of the denial of a COA is\ncertainly not limited to grounds expressly addressed by the court\nwhose decision is under review. But on the unusual facts of this\ncase, the Court of Appeals’ review should not have rested on the\nground that it was indisputable among reasonable jurists that\nGattie’s service on the jury did not prejudice Tharpe. We therefore grant Tharpe’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis , grant the petition for certiorari, vacate\nthe judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for\nfurther consideration of the question whether Tharpe is entitled to\na COA. It is so ordered.",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus Iancu, Under Secretary of Commerce for\nIntellectual Property and Director, Patent and Trademark Office v. Brunetti certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the federal circuit No. 18–302. Argued April 15, 2019—Decided June\n24, 2019 Respondent Erik Brunetti sought federal\nregistration of the trademark FUCT. The Patent and Trademark Office\n(PTO) denied his application under a provision of the Lanham Act\nthat prohibits registration of trademarks that “[c]onsist[ ]\nof or comprise[ ] immoral[ ] or scandalous matter,” 15\nU. S. C. §1052(a). Brunetti brought a First Amendment\nchallenge to the “immoral or scandalous” bar in the Federal\nCircuit, which invalidated the provision. Held : The Lanham Act’s prohibition on\nregistration of “immoral[ ] or scandalous” trademarks violates\nthe First Amendment. In Matal v. Tam , 582 U. S.\n___, this Court declared unconstitutional the Lanham Act’s ban on\nregistering marks that “disparage” any “person[ ], living or dead.”\n§1052(a). A divided Court agreed on two propositions. First, if a\ntrademark registration bar is viewpoint based, it is\nunconstitutional. And second, the disparagement bar was viewpoint\nbased. The “immoral or scandalous” bar similarly\ndiscriminates on the basis of viewpoint and so collides with this\nCourt’s First Amendment doctrine. Expressive material is “immoral”\nwhen it is “inconsistent with rectitude, purity, or good morals”;\n“wicked”; or “vicious.” So the Lanham Act permits registration of\nmarks that champion society’s sense of rectitude and morality, but\nnot marks that denigrate those concepts. And material is\n“scandalous” when it “giv[es] offense to the conscience or moral\nfeelings”; “excite[s] reprobation”; or “call[s] out condemnation.”\nSo the Lanham Act allows registration of marks when their messages\naccord with, but not when their messages defy, society’s sense of\ndecency or propriety. The statute, on its face, distinguishes\nbetween two opposed sets of ideas: those aligned with conventional\nmoral standards and those hostile to them; those inducing societal\nnods of approval and those provoking offense and condemnation. This\nfacial viewpoint bias in the law results in\nviewpoint-discriminatory application. The PTO has refused to\nregister marks communicating “immoral” or “scandalous” views about\n(among other things) drug use, religion, and terrorism. But all the\nwhile, it has approved registration of marks expressing more\naccepted views on the same topics. The Government says the statute is susceptible\nof a limiting construction that would remove its viewpoint bias.\nThe Government’s idea is to narrow the statutory bar to “marks that\nare offensive [or] shocking[ ] because of their mode of\nexpression, independent of any views that they may express,” which\nwould mostly restrict the PTO to refusing marks that are lewd,\nsexually explicit, or profane. But this Court cannot accept the\nGovernment’s proposal, because the statute says something markedly\ndifferent. The “immoral or scandalous” bar does not draw the line\nat lewd, sexually explicit, or profane marks. Nor does it refer\nonly to marks whose “mode of expression,” independent of viewpoint,\nis particularly offensive. To cut the statute off where the\nGovernment urges is not to interpret the statute Congress enacted,\nbut to fashion a new one. And once the “immoral or scandalous” bar\nis interpreted fairly, it must be invalidated. Pp. 4–11. 877 F.3d 1330, affirmed. Kagan, J., delivered the opinion of the Court,\nin which Thomas, Ginsburg, Alito, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, JJ.,\njoined. Alito, J., filed a concurring opinion. Roberts, C. J.,\nand Breyer, J., filed opinions concurring in part and dissenting in\npart. Sotomayor, J., filed an opinion concurring in part and\ndissenting in part, in which Breyer, J., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 18–302 _________________ ANDREI IANCU, UNDER SECRETARY OF COMMERCE FOR\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIRECTOR, PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE,\nPETITIONER v. ERIK BRUNETTI on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the federal circuit [June 24, 2019] Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. Two Terms ago, in Matal v. Tam ,\n582 U. S. ___ (2017), this Court invalidated the Lanham Act’s\nbar on the registration of “disparag[ing]” trademarks. 15\nU. S. C. §1052(a). Although split between two\nnon-majority opinions, all Members of the Court agreed that the\nprovision violated the First Amendment because it discriminated on\nthe basis of viewpoint. Today we consider a First Amendment\nchallenge to a neighboring provision of the Act, prohibiting the\nregistration of “immoral[ ] or scandalous” trademarks. Ibid. We hold that this provision infringes the First\nAmendment for the same reason: It too disfavors certain ideas. I Respondent Erik Brunetti is an artist and\nentrepreneur who founded a clothing line that uses the trademark\nFUCT. According to Brunetti, the mark (which functions as the\nclothing’s brand name) is pronounced as four letters, one after the\nother: F-U-C-T. See Brief for Respondent 1. But you might read it\ndifferently and, if so, you would hardly be alone. See Tr. of Oral\nArg. 5 (describing the brand name as “the equivalent of [the] past\nparticiple form of a well-known word of profanity”). That common\nperception caused difficulties for Brunetti when he tried to\nregister his mark with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office\n(PTO). Under the Lanham Act, the PTO administers a\nfederal registration system for trademarks. See 15\nU. S. C. §§1051, 1052. Registration of a mark is not\nmandatory. The owner of an unregistered mark may still use it in\ncommerce and enforce it against infringers. See Tam , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4). But registration gives\ntrademark owners valuable benefits. For example, registration\nconstitutes “prima facie evidence” of the mark’s validity.\n§1115(a). And registration serves as “constructive notice of the\nregistrant’s claim of ownership,” which forecloses some defenses in\ninfringement actions. §1072. Generally, a trademark is eligible for\nregistration, and receipt of such benefits, if it is “used in\ncommerce.” §1051(a)(1). But the Act directs the PTO to\n“refuse[ ] registration” of certain marks. §1052. For\ninstance, the PTO cannot register a mark that “so resembles”\nanother mark as to create a likelihood of confusion. §1052(d). It\ncannot register a mark that is “merely descriptive” of the goods on\nwhich it is used. §1052(e). It cannot register a mark containing\nthe flag or insignia of any nation or State. See §1052(b). There\nare five or ten more (depending on how you count). And until we\ninvalidated the criterion two years ago, the PTO could not register\na mark that “disparage[d]” a “person[ ], living or dead.”\n§1052(a); see Tam , 582 U. S. ___. This case involves another of the Lanham Act’s\nprohibitions on registration—one applying to marks that\n“[c]onsist[ ] of or comprise[ ] immoral[ ] or\nscandalous matter.” §1052(a). The PTO applies that bar as a\n“unitary provision,” rather than treating the two adjectives in it\nseparately. In re Brunetti , 877 F.3d 1330, 1336 (CA\nFed. 2017); Brief for Petitioner 6 (stating that the PTO “has long\ntreated the two terms as composing a single category”). To\ndetermine whether a mark fits in the category, the PTO asks whether\na “substantial composite of the general public” would find the mark\n“shocking to the sense of truth, decency, or propriety”; “giving\noffense to the conscience or moral feelings”; “calling out for\ncondemnation”; “disgraceful”; “offensive”; “disreputable”; or\n“vulgar.” 877 F. 3d, at 1336 (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see Brief for Petitioner 6 (agreeing that the PTO\n“generally defines” the category in that way). Both a PTO examining attorney and the PTO’s\nTrademark Trial and Appeal Board decided that Brunetti’s mark\nflunked that test. The attorney determined that FUCT was “a total\nvulgar” and “therefore[ ] unregistrable.” App. 27–28. On\nreview, the Board stated that the mark was “highly offensive” and\n“vulgar,” and that it had “decidedly negative sexual connotations.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 59a, 64a–65a. As part of its review, the\nBoard also considered evidence of how Brunetti used the mark. It\nfound that Brunetti’s website and products contained imagery, near\nthe mark, of “extreme nihilism” and “anti-social” behavior. Id., at 64a. In that context, the Board thought, the mark\ncommunicated “misogyny, depravity, [and] violence.” Ibid .\nThe Board concluded: “Whether one considers [the mark] as a sexual\nterm, or finds that [Brunetti] has used [the mark] in the context\nof extreme misogyny, nihilism or violence, we have no question but\nthat [the term is] extremely offensive.” Id., at 65a. Brunetti then brought a facial challenge to the\n“immoral or scandalous” bar in the Court of Appeals for the Federal\nCircuit. That court found the prohibition to violate the First\nAmendment. As usual when a lower court has invalidated a federal\nstatute, we granted certiorari. 586 U. S. ___ (2019). II This Court first considered a First Amendment\nchallenge to a trademark registration restriction in Tam ,\njust two Terms ago. There, the Court declared unconstitutional the\nLanham Act’s ban on registering marks that “disparage” any\n“person[ ], living or dead.” §1052(a). The eight-Justice Court\ndivided evenly between two opinions and could not agree on the\noverall framework for deciding the case. (In particular, no\nmajority emerged to resolve whether a Lanham Act bar is a condition\non a government benefit or a simple restriction on speech.) But all\nthe Justices agreed on two propositions. First, if a trademark\nregistration bar is viewpoint-based, it is unconstitutional. See\n582 U. S., at ___–___, ___–___ (opinion of Alito, J.) (slip\nop., at 1–2, 22–23); id., at ___–___, ___ (opinion of\nKennedy, J.) (slip op., at 1–2, 5). And second, the disparagement\nbar was viewpoint-based. See id., at ___–___, ___–___\n(opinion of Alito, J.) (slip op., at 1–2, 22–23); id., at\n___–___ (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (slip op., at 2–5). The Justices thus found common ground in a core\npostulate of free speech law: The government may not discriminate\nagainst speech based on the ideas or opinions it conveys. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S.\n819 , 829–830 (1995) (explaining that viewpoint discrimination\nis an “egregious form of content discrimination” and is\n“presumptively unconstitutional”). In Justice Kennedy’s\nexplanation, the disparagement bar allowed a trademark owner to\nregister a mark if it was “positive” about a person, but not if it\nwas “derogatory.” Tam , 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n2). That was the “essence of viewpoint discrimination,” he\ncontinued, because “[t]he law thus reflects the Government’s\ndisapproval of a subset of messages it finds offensive.” Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 2–3). Justice Alito emphasized\nthat the statute “denie[d] registration to any mark” whose\ndisparaging message was “offensive to a substantial percentage of\nthe members of any group.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 22).\nThe bar thus violated the “bedrock First Amendment principle” that\nthe government cannot discriminate against “ideas that offend.” Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2). Slightly different\nexplanations, then, but a shared conclusion: Viewpoint\ndiscrimination doomed the disparagement bar. If the “immoral or scandalous” bar similarly\ndiscriminates on the basis of viewpoint, it must also collide with\nour First Amendment doctrine. The Government does not argue\notherwise. In briefs and oral argument, the Government offers a\ntheory for upholding the bar if it is viewpoint-neutral\n(essentially, that the bar would then be a reasonable condition on\na government benefit). See Brief for Petitioner 14–26. But the\nGovernment agrees that under Tam it may not “deny\nregistration based on the views expressed” by a mark. Tr. of Oral\nArg. 24. “As the Court’s Tam decision establishes,” the\nGovernment says, “the criteria for federal trademark registration”\nmust be “viewpoint-neutral to survive Free Speech Clause review.”\nPet. for Cert. 19. So the key question becomes: Is the “immoral or\nscandalous” criterion in the Lanham Act viewpoint-neutral or\nviewpoint-based? It is viewpoint-based. The meanings of “immoral”\nand “scandalous” are not mysterious, but resort to some\ndictionaries still helps to lay bare the problem. When is\nexpressive material “immoral”? According to a standard definition,\nwhen it is “inconsistent with rectitude, purity, or good morals”;\n“wicked”; or “vicious.” Webster’s New International Dictionary 1246\n(2d ed. 1949). Or again, when it is “opposed to or violating\nmorality”; or “morally evil.” Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 961\n(3d ed. 1947). So the Lanham Act permits registration of marks that\nchampion society’s sense of rectitude and morality, but not marks\nthat denigrate those concepts. And when is such material\n“scandalous”? Says a typical definition, when it “giv[es] offense\nto the conscience or moral feelings”; “excite[s] reprobation”; or\n“call[s] out condemnation.” Webster’s New International Dictionary,\nat 2229. Or again, when it is “shocking to the sense of truth,\ndecency, or propriety”; “disgraceful”; “offensive”; or\n“disreputable.” Funk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary 2186\n(1944). So the Lanham Act allows registration of marks when their\nmessages accord with, but not when their messages defy, society’s\nsense of decency or propriety. Put the pair of overlapping terms\ntogether and the statute, on its face, distinguishes between two\nopposed sets of ideas: those aligned with conventional moral\nstandards and those hostile to them; those inducing societal nods\nof approval and those provoking offense and condemnation. The\nstatute favors the former, and disfavors the latter. “Love rules”?\n“Always be good”? Registration follows. “Hate rules”? “Always be\ncruel”? Not according to the Lanham Act’s “immoral or scandalous”\nbar. The facial viewpoint bias in the law results in\nviewpoint-discriminatory application. Recall that the PTO itself\ndescribes the “immoral or scandalous” criterion using much the same\nlanguage as in the dictionary definitions recited above. See supra, at 3. The PTO, for example, asks whether the public\nwould view the mark as “shocking to the sense of truth, decency, or\npropriety”; “calling out for condemnation”; “offensive”; or\n“disrepu- table.” Brief for Petitioner 6 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Using those guideposts, the PTO has refused to register\nmarks communicating “immoral” or “scandalous” views about (among\nother things) drug use, religion, and terrorism. But all the while,\nit has approved registration of marks expressing more accepted\nviews on the same topics. See generally Gilson & LaLonde,\nTrademarks Laid Bare, 101 Trademark Reporter 1476, 1510–1513,\n1518–1522 (2011); Brief for Barton Beebe et al. as Amici\nCuriae 28–29. Here are some samples. The PTO rejected marks\nconveying approval of drug use (YOU CAN’T SPELL HEALTHCARE WITHOUT\nTHC for pain-relief medication, MARIJUANA COLA and KO KANE for\nbeverages) because it is scandalous to “inappropriately glamoriz[e]\ndrug abuse.” PTO, Office Action of Aug. 28, 2010, Serial No.\n85038867; see Office Action of Dec. 24, 2009, Serial No. 77833964;\nOffice Action of Nov. 17, 2009, Serial No. 77671304. But at the\nsame time, the PTO registered marks with such sayings as D.A.R.E.\nTO RESIST DRUGS AND VIOLENCE and SAY NO TO DRUGS—REALITY IS THE\nBEST TRIP IN LIFE. See PTO, Reg. No. 2975163 (July 26, 2005); Reg.\nNo. 2966019 (July 12, 2005). Similarly, the PTO disapproved\nregistration for the mark BONG HITS 4 JESUS because it “suggests\nthat people should engage in an illegal activity [in connection\nwith] worship” and because “Christians would be morally outraged by\na statement that connects Jesus Christ with illegal drug use.”\nOffice Action of Mar. 15, 2008, Serial No. 77305946. And the PTO\nrefused to register trademarks associating religious references\nwith products (AGNUS DEI for safes and MADONNA for wine) because\nthey would be “offensive to most individuals of the Christian\nfaith” and “shocking to the sense of propriety.” Ex parte Summit\nBrass & Bronze Works , 59 USPQ 22, 23 (Dec. Com. Pat. 1943); In re Riverbank Canning Co. , 95 F.2d 327, 329 (CCPA 1938).\nBut once again, the PTO approved marks—PRAISE THE LORD for a game\nand JESUS DIED FOR YOU on clothing—whose message suggested\nreligious faith rather than blasphemy or irreverence. See Reg. No.\n5265121 (Aug. 15, 2017); Reg. No. 3187985 (Dec. 19, 2006). Finally,\nthe PTO rejected marks reflecting support for al-Qaeda (BABY AL\nQAEDA and AL-QAEDA on t-shirts) “because the bombing of civilians\nand other terrorist acts are shocking to the sense of decency and\ncall out for condemnation.” Office Action of Nov. 22, 2004, Serial\nNo. 78444968; see Office Action of Feb. 23, 2005, Serial No.\n78400213. Yet it approved registration of a mark with the words WAR\nON TERROR MEMORIAL. Reg. No. 5495362 (Jun. 19, 2018). Of course,\nall these decisions are understandable. The rejected marks express\nopinions that are, at the least, offensive to many Americans. But\nas the Court made clear in Tam , a law disfavoring “ideas\nthat offend” discriminates based on viewpoint, in violation of the\nFirst Amendment. 582 U. S., at ___ (opinion of Alito, J.)\n(slip op., at 2); see id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 22–23); id., at ___–___ (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (slip op., at\n2–3). How, then, can the Government claim that the\n“immoral or scandalous” bar is viewpoint-neutral? The Government\nbasically asks us to treat decisions like those described above as\nPTO examiners’ mistakes. See Brief for Petitioner 46. Still more,\nthe Government tells us to ignore how the Lanham Act’s language, on\nits face, disfavors some ideas. In urging that course, the\nGovernment does not dispute that the statutory language—and words\nused to define it—have just that effect. At oral argument, the\nGovernment conceded: “[I]f you just looked at the words like\n‘shocking’ and ‘offensive’ on their face and gave them their\nordinary meanings[,] they could easily encompass material that was\nshocking [or offensive] because it expressed an outrageous point of\nview or a point of view that most members” of society reject. Tr.\nof Oral Arg. 6. But no matter, says the Government, because the\nstatute is “susceptible of” a limiting construction that would\nremove this viewpoint bias. Id., at 7 (arguing that the\nCourt should “attempt to construe [the] statute in a way that would\nrender it constitutional”). The Government’s idea, abstractly\nphrased, is to narrow the statutory bar to “marks that are\noffensive [or] shocking to a substantial segment of the public\nbecause of their mode of expression, independent of any\nviews that they may express.” Id., at 11 (emphasis added);\nsee Brief for Petitioner 27–28. More concretely, the Government\nexplains that this reinterpretation would mostly restrict the PTO\nto refusing marks that are “vulgar”—meaning “lewd,” “sexually\nexplicit or profane.” Id., at 27, 30. Such a reconfigured\nbar, the Government says, would not turn on viewpoint, and so we\ncould uphold it. But we cannot accept the Government’s proposal,\nbecause the statute says something markedly different. This Court,\nof course, may interpret “ambiguous statutory language” to “avoid\nserious constitutional doubts.” FCC v. Fox Television\nStations, Inc. , 556 U.S.\n502 , 516 (2009). But that canon of construction applies only\nwhen ambiguity exists. “We will not rewrite a law to conform it to\nconstitutional requirements.” United States v. Stevens , 559 U.S.\n460 , 481 (2010) (internal quotation marks and alteration\nomitted). So even assuming the Government’s reading would eliminate\nFirst Amendment problems, we may adopt it only if we can see it in\nthe statutory language. And we cannot. The “immoral or scandalous”\nbar stretches far beyond the Government’s proposed construction.\nThe statute as written does not draw the line at lewd, sexually\nexplicit, or profane marks. Nor does it refer only to marks whose\n“mode of expression,” independent of viewpoint, is particularly\noffensive. Brief for Petitioner 28 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). It covers the universe of immoral or scandalous—or (to\nuse some PTO synonyms) offensive or disreputable—material. Whether\nor not lewd or profane. Whether the scandal and immorality comes\nfrom mode or instead from viewpoint. To cut the statute off where\nthe Government urges is not to interpret the statute Congress\nenacted, but to fashion a new one.[ 1 ]* And once the “immoral or scandalous” bar is\ninterpreted fairly, it must be invalidated. The Government just\nbarely argues otherwise. In the last paragraph of its brief, the\nGovernment gestures toward the idea that the provision is\nsalvageable by virtue of its constitutionally permissible\napplications (in the Government’s view, its applications to lewd,\nsexually explicit, or profane marks). See id. , at 47. In\nother words, the Government invokes our First Amendment overbreadth\ndoctrine, and asks us to uphold the statute against facial attack\nbecause its unconstitutional applications are not “substantial”\nrelative to “the statute’s plainly legitimate sweep.” Stevens , 559 U. S., at 473 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But to begin with, this Court has never applied that kind\nof analysis to a viewpoint-discriminatory law. In Tam , for\nexample, we did not pause to consider whether the disparagement\nclause might admit some permissible applications (say, to certain\nlibelous speech) before striking it down. The Court’s finding of\nviewpoint bias ended the matter. And similarly, it seems unlikely\nwe would compare permissible and impermissible applications if\nCongress outright banned “offensive” (or to use some other\nexamples, “divisive” or “subversive”) speech. Once we have found\nthat a law “aim[s] at the suppression of ” views, why would it\nmatter that Congress could have captured some of the same speech\nthrough a viewpoint-neutral statute? Tam , 582 U. S., at\n___ (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (slip op., at 2). But in any event,\nthe “immoral or scandalous” bar is substantially overbroad. There\nare a great many immoral and scandalous ideas in the world (even\nmore than there are swearwords), and the Lanham Act covers them\nall. It therefore violates the First Amendment. We accordingly affirm the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals. It is so ordered. Notes 1 *We reject the dissent’s\nstatutory surgery for the same reason. Al-though conceding that the\nterm “immoral” cannot be saved, the dissent thinks that the term\n“scandalous” can be read as the Government proposes. See post, at 1–2 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). But that term is not “ambiguous,” as the\ndissent argues, post, at 3; it is just broad. Remember that\nthe dictionaries define it to mean offensive, disreputable,\nexciting reprobation, and so forth. See supra, at 5–6; post, at 3 (accepting those definitions). Even if hived off\nfrom “immoral” marks, the category of scandalous marks thus\nincludes both marks that offend by the ideas they convey and marks that offend by their mode of expression. And its\ncoverage of the former means that it discriminates based on\nviewpoint. We say nothing at all about a statute that covers only\nthe latter—or, in the Government’s more concrete description, a\nstatute limited to lewd, sexually explicit, and profane marks. Nor\ndo we say anything about how to evaluate viewpoint-neutral\nrestrictions on trademark registration, see post, at\n14–17—because the “scandalous” bar (whether or not attached to the\n“immoral” bar) is not one.",

Mississippi certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi No. 17–9572. Argued March 20, 2019—Decided\nJune 21, 2019 Petitioner Curtis Flowers has been tried six\nseparate times for the murder of four employees of a Mississippi\nfurniture store. Flowers is black; three of the four victims were\nwhite. At the first two trials, the State used its peremptory\nstrikes on all of the qualified black prospective jurors. In each\ncase, the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death, but\nthe convictions were later reversed by the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt based on prosecutorial misconduct. At the third trial, the\nState used all of its 15 peremptory strikes against black\nprospective jurors, and the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed again, this\ntime concluding that the State exercised its peremptory strikes on\nthe basis of race in violation of Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 . Flowers’ fourth and fifth trials ended in mistrials. At the\nfourth, the State exercised 11 peremptory strikes—all against black\nprospective jurors. No available racial information exists about\nthe prospective jurors in the fifth trial. At the sixth trial, the\nState exercised six peremptory strikes—five against black\nprospective jurors, allowing one black juror to be seated. Flowers\nagain raised a Batson claim, but the trial court concluded\nthat the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each of the\nfive peremptory strikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed. After this\nCourt vacated that judgment and remanded in light of Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt again upheld Flowers’ conviction in a divided 5-to-4\ndecision. Justice King dissented on the Batson issue and was\njoined by two other Justices. Held : All of the relevant facts\nand circumstances taken together establish that the trial court at\nFlowers’ sixth trial committed clear error in concluding that the\nState’s peremptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright\nwas not motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.\nPp. 7–31. (a) Under Batson , once a prima\nfacie case of discrimination has been shown by a defendant, the\nState must provide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes.\nThe trial judge then must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated\nreasons were the actual reasons or instead were a pretext for\ndiscrimination. The Batson Court rejected four arguments.\nFirst, the Batson Court rejected the idea that a defendant\nmust demonstrate a history of racially discriminatory strikes in\norder to make out a claim of race discrimination. Second, the Batson Court rejected the argument that a prosecutor could\nstrike a black juror based on an assumption or belief that the\nblack juror would favor a black defendant. Third, the Batson Court rejected the argument that race-based peremptories should be\npermissible because black, white, Asian, and Hispanic defendants\nand jurors were all “equally” subject to race-based discrimination.\nFourth, the Batson Court rejected the argument that\nrace-based peremptories are permissible because both the\nprosecution and defense could employ them in any individual case\nand in essence balance things out. Pp. 7–15. (b) Four categories of evidence loom\nlarge in assessing the Batson issue here, where the State\nhad a persistent pattern of striking black prospective jurors from\nFlowers’ first through his sixth trial. Pp. 15–30. (1) A review of the history of the\nState’s peremptory strikes in Flowers’ first four trials strongly\nsupports the conclusion that the State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial was motivated in substantial part by\ndiscriminatory intent. The State tried to strike all 36 black\nprospective jurors over the course of the first four trials. And\nthe state courts themselves concluded that the State had violated Batson on two separate occasions . The State’s\nrelentless, determined effort to rid the jury of black individuals\nstrongly suggests that the State wanted to try Flowers before a\njury with as few black jurors as possible, and ideally before an\nall-white jury. Pp. 19–22. (2) The State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial followed the same pattern as the first four\ntrials. Pp. 22–23. (3) Disparate questioning can be\nprobative of discriminatory intent. Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U.S.\n322 , 331–332, 344–345. Here, the State spent far more time\nquestioning the black prospective jurors than the accepted white\njurors—145 questions asked of 5 black prospective jurors and 12\nquestions asked of 11 white seated jurors. The record refutes the\nState’s explanation that it questioned black and white prospective\njurors differently only because of differences in the jurors’\ncharacteristics. Along with the historical evidence from the\nearlier trials, as well as the State’s striking of five of six\nblack prospective jurors at the sixth trial, the dramatically\ndisparate questioning and investigation of black prospective jurors\nand white prospective jurors at the sixth trial strongly suggest\nthat the State was motivated in substantial part by a\ndiscriminatory intent. Pp. 23–26. (4) Comparing prospective jurors who were\nstruck and not struck can be an important step in determining\nwhether a Batson violation occurred. See Snyder v. Louisiana , 552 U.S.\n472 , 483–484. Here, Carolyn Wright, a black prospective juror,\nwas struck, the State says, in part because she knew several\ndefense witnesses and had worked at Wal-Mart where Flowers’ father\nalso worked. But three white prospective jurors also knew many\nindividuals involved in the case, and the State asked them no\nindividual questions about their connections to witnesses. White\nprospective jurors also had relationships with members of Flowers’\nfamily, but the State did not ask them follow-up questions in order\nto explore the depth of those relationships. The State also\nincorrectly explained that it exercised a peremptory strike against\nWright because she had worked with one of Flowers’ sisters and made\napparently incorrect statements to justify the strikes of other\nblack prospective jurors. When considered with other evidence, a\nseries of factually inaccurate explanations for striking black\nprospective jurors can be another clue showing discriminatory\nintent. The overall context here requires skepticism of the State’s\nstrike of Carolyn Wright. The trial court at Flowers’ sixth trial\ncommitted clear error in concluding that the State’s peremptory\nstrike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not motivated\nin substantial part by discriminatory intent. Pp. 26–30. 240 So. 3d 1082, reversed and remanded. Kavanaugh, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 17–9572 _________________ CURTIS GIOVANNI FLOWERS, PETITIONER v. MISSISSIPPI on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi [June 21, 2019] Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. In Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 (1986), this Court ruled that a State may not discriminate\non the basis of race when exercising peremptory challenges against\nprospective jurors in a criminal trial. In 1996, Curtis Flowers allegedly murdered four\npeople in Winona, Mississippi. Flowers is black. He has been tried\nsix separate times before a jury for murder. The same lead\nprosecutor represented the State in all six trials. In the initial three trials, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed each\nconviction. In the first trial, Flowers was convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to “numerous\ninstances of prosecutorial misconduct.” Flowers v. State , 773 So. 2d 309, 327 (2000). In the second trial, the\ntrial court found that the prosecutor discriminated on the basis of\nrace in the peremptory challenge of a black juror. The trial court\nseated the black juror. Flowers was then convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court again reversed the conviction because of\nprosecutorial misconduct at trial. In the third trial, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court yet again reversed the\nconviction, this time because the court concluded that the\nprosecutor had again discriminated against black prospective jurors\nin the jury selection process. The court’s lead opinion stated:\n“The instant case presents us with as strong a prima facie case of\nracial discrimination as we have ever seen in the context of a Batson challenge.” Flowers v. State , 947 So.\n2d 910, 935 (2007). The opinion further stated that the “State\nengaged in racially discriminatory practices during the jury\nselection process” and that the “case evinces an effort by the\nState to exclude African-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. The fourth and fifth trials of Flowers ended in\nmistrials due to hung juries. In his sixth trial, which is the one at issue\nhere, Flowers was convicted. The State struck five of the six black\nprospective jurors. On appeal, Flowers argued that the State again\nviolated Batson in exercising peremptory strikes against\nblack prospective jurors. In a divided 5-to-4 decision, the\nMississippi Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. We granted\ncertiorari on the Batson question and now reverse. See 586\nU. S. ___ (2018). Four critical facts, taken together, require\nreversal. First , in the six trials combined, the State\nemployed its peremptory challenges to strike 41 of the 42 black\nprospective jurors that it could have struck—a statistic that the\nState acknowledged at oral argument in this Court. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n32. Second , in the most recent trial, the sixth trial, the\nState exercised peremptory strikes against five of the six black\nprospective jurors. Third , at the sixth trial, in an\napparent effort to find pretextual reasons to strike black\nprospective jurors, the State engaged in dramatically disparate\nquestioning of black and white prospective jurors. Fourth ,\nthe State then struck at least one black prospective juror, Carolyn\nWright, who was similarly situated to white prospective jurors who\nwere not struck by the State. We need not and do not decide that any one of\nthose four facts alone would require reversal. All that we need to\ndecide, and all that we do decide, is that all of the relevant\nfacts and circumstances taken together establish that the trial\ncourt committed clear error in concluding that the State’s\nperemptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not\n“motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.” Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016)\n(slip op., at 23) (internal quotation marks omitted). In reaching\nthat conclusion, we break no new legal ground. We simply enforce\nand reinforce Batson by applying it to the extraordinary\nfacts of this case. We reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of\nMississippi, and we remand the case for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion. I The underlying events that gave rise to this\ncase took place in Winona, Mississippi. Winona is a small town in\nnorthern Mississippi, just off I–55 almost halfway between Jackson\nand Memphis. The total population of Winona is about 5,000. The\ntown is about 53 percent black and about 46 percent white. In 1996, Bertha Tardy, Robert Golden, Derrick\nStewart, and Carmen Rigby were murdered at the Tardy Furniture\nstore in Winona. All four victims worked at the Tardy Furniture\nstore. Three of the four victims were white; one was black. In\n1997, the State charged Curtis Flowers with murder. Flowers is\nblack. Since then, Flowers has been tried six separate times for\nthe murders. In each of the first two trials, Flowers was tried for\none individual murder. In each subsequent trial, Flowers was tried\nfor all four of the murders together. The same state prosecutor\ntried Flowers each time. The prosecutor is white. At Flowers’ first trial, 36 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 31 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nThe State exercised a total of 12 peremptory strikes, and it used 5\nof them to strike the five qualified black prospective jurors.\nFlowers objected, arguing under Batson that the State had\nexercised its peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory\nmanner. The trial court rejected the Batson challenge.\nBecause the trial court allowed the State’s peremptory strikes,\nFlowers was tried in front of an all-white jury. The jury convicted\nFlowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court\nreversed the conviction, concluding that the State had committed\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, expressing baseless grounds for doubting the credibility of\nwitnesses and mentioning facts that had not been allowed into\nevidence by the trial judge. Flowers , 773 So. 2d, at\n317, 334. In its opinion, the Mississippi Supreme Court described\n“numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct” at the trial. Id., at 327. Because the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed\nbased on prosecutorial misconduct at trial, the court did not reach\nFlowers’ Batson argument. See Flowers , 773\nSo. 2d, at 327 . At the second trial, 30 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 25 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nAs in Flowers’ first trial, the State again used its strikes\nagainst all five black prospective jurors. But this time, the trial\ncourt determined that the State’s asserted reason for one of the\nstrikes was a pretext for discrimination. Specifically, the trial\ncourt determined that one of the State’s proffered reasons—that the\njuror had been inattentive and was nodding off during jury\nselection—for striking that juror was false, and the trial court\ntherefore sustained Flowers’ Batson challenge. The trial\ncourt disallowed the strike and sat that black juror on the jury.\nThe jury at Flowers’ second trial consisted of 11 white jurors and\n1 black juror. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to\ndeath. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court again\nreversed. The court ruled that the prosecutor had again engaged in\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, impermissibly referencing evidence and attempting to\nundermine witness credibility without a factual basis. See Flowers v. State , 842 So. 2d 531, 538, 553\n(2003). At Flowers’ third trial, 45 prospective\njurors—17 black and 28 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. One of the black prospective jurors was struck for cause,\nleaving 16. The State exercised a total of 15 peremptory strikes,\nand it used all 15 against black prospective jurors. Flowers again\nargued that the State had used its peremptory strikes in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner. The trial court found that the State had not\ndiscriminated on the basis of race. See Flowers , 947\nSo. 2d, at 916. The jury in Flowers’ third trial consisted of\n11 white jurors and 1 black juror. The lone black juror who served\non the jury was seated after the State ran out of peremptory\nstrikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court yet\nagain reversed, concluding that the State had again violated Batson by discriminating on the basis of race in exercising\nall 15 of its peremptory strikes against 15 black prospective\njurors. See Flowers , 947 So. 2d, at 939. The court’s\nlead opinion stated: “The instant case presents us with as strong a\nprima facie case of racial discrimination as we have ever seen in\nthe context of a Batson challenge.” Id., at 935. The\nopinion explained that although “each individual strike may have\njustifiably appeared to the trial court to be sufficiently race\nneutral, the trial court also has a duty to look at the State’s use\nof peremptory challenges in toto .” Id., at 937.\nThe opinion emphasized that “trial judges should not blindly accept\nany and every reason put forth by the State, especially” when “the\nState continues to exercise challenge after challenge only upon\nmembers of a particular race.” Ibid . The opinion added that\nthe “State engaged in racially discriminatory practices” and that\nthe “case evinces an effort by the State to exclude\nAfrican-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. At Flowers’ fourth trial, 36 prospective\njurors—16 black and 20 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. The State exercised a total of 11 peremptory strikes, and\nit used all 11 against black prospective jurors. But because of the\nrelatively large number of prospective jurors who were black, the\nState did not have enough peremptory challenges to eliminate all of\nthe black prospective jurors. The seated jury consisted of seven\nwhite jurors and five black jurors. That jury could not reach a\nverdict, and the proceeding ended in a mistrial. As to the fifth trial, there is no available\nracial information about the prospective jurors, as distinct from\nthe jurors who ultimately sat on the jury. The jury was composed of\nnine white jurors and three black jurors. The jury could not reach\na verdict, and the trial again ended in a mistrial. At the sixth trial, which we consider here, 26\nprospective jurors—6 black and 20 white—were presented to\npotentially serve on the jury. The State exercised a total of six\nperemptory strikes, and it used five of the six against black\nprospective jurors, leaving one black juror to sit on the jury.\nFlowers again argued that the State had exercised its peremptory\nstrikes in a racially discrimina-tory manner. The trial court\nconcluded that the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each\nof the five peremp-tory strikes against the five black prospective\njurors. The jury at Flowers’ sixth trial consisted of 11 white\njurors and 1 black juror. That jury convicted Flowers of murder and\nsentenced him to death. In a divided decision, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt agreed with the trial court on the Batson issue and\nstated that the State’s “race-neutral reasons were valid and not\nmerely pretextual.” Flowers v. State , 158 So. 3d\n1009, 1058 (2014). Flowers then sought review in this Court. This\nCourt granted Flowers’ petition for a writ of certio-rari, vacated\nthe judgment of the Mississippi Supreme Court, and remanded for\nfurther consideration in light of the decision in Foster ,\n578 U. S. ___. Flowers v. Mississippi , 579\nU. S. ___ (2016). In Foster , this Court held that the\ndefendant Foster had established a Batson violation. 578\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 25). On remand, the Mississippi Supreme Court by a\n5-to-4 vote again upheld Flowers’ conviction. See 240 So. 3d 1082\n(2017). Justice King wrote a dissent for three justices. He stated:\n“I cannot conclude that Flowers received a fair trial, nor can I\nconclude that prospective jurors were not subjected to\nimpermissible discrimination.” Id ., at 1172. According to\nJustice King, both the trial court and the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt “completely disregard[ed] the constitutional right of\nprospective jurors to be free from a racially discriminatory\nselection process.” Id., at 1171. We granted certiorari. See\n586 U. S. ___. II A Other than voting, serving on a jury is the\nmost substantial opportunity that most citizens have to participate\nin the democratic process. See Powers v. Ohio , 499 U.S.\n400 , 407 (1991). Jury selection in criminal cases varies\nsignificantly based on state and local rules and practices, but\nordinarily consists of three phases, which we describe here in\ngeneral terms. First , a group of citizens in the community\nis randomly summoned to the courthouse on a particular day for\npotential jury service. Second , a subgroup of those\nprospective jurors is called into a particular courtroom for a\nspecific case. The prospective jurors are often questioned by the\njudge, as well as by the prosecutor and defense attorney. During\nthat second phase, the judge may excuse certain prospective jurors\nbased on their answers. Third , the prosecutor and defense\nattorney may challenge certain prospective jurors. The attorneys\nmay challenge prospective jurors for cause, which usually stems\nfrom a potential juror’s conflicts of interest or inability to be\nimpartial. In addition to challenges for cause, each side is\ntypically afforded a set number of peremptory challenges or\nstrikes. Peremptory strikes have very old credentials and can be\ntraced back to the common law. Those peremptory strikes\ntraditionally may be used to remove any potential juror for any\nreason—no questions asked. That blanket discretion to peremptorily strike\nprospective jurors for any reason can clash with the dictates of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. This case arises at the intersection of\nthe peremptory challenge and the Equal Protection Clause. And to\nunderstand how equal protection law applies to peremptory\nchallenges, it helps to begin at the beginning. Ratified in 1868 in the wake of the Civil War,\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides\nthat no State shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\nequal protection of the laws.” A primary objective of the Equal\nProtection Clause, this Court stated just five years after\nratification, was “the freedom of the slave race, the security and\nfirm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the\nnewly-made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who\nhad formerly exercised unlimited dominion over him.” Slaughter-House Cases , 16 Wall. 36, 71 (1873). In 1875, to help enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Congress passed and President Ulysses S. Grant signed\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1875. Ch. 114, 18Stat. 335. Among other\nthings, that law made it a criminal offense for state officials to\nexclude individuals from jury service on account of their race. 18\nU. S. C. §243. The Act provides: “No citizen possessing\nall other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by law\nshall be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any\ncourt of the United States, or of any State on account of race,\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.” In 1880, just 12 years after ratification of the\nFourteenth Amendment, the Court decided Strauder v. West\nVirginia , 100 U.S.\n303 . That case concerned a West Virginia statute that allowed\nwhites only to serve as jurors. The Court held the law\nunconstitutional. In reaching its conclusion, the Court explained\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment required “that the law in the States\nshall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons,\nwhether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the\nStates, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose protection\nthe amendment was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall\nbe made against them by law because of their color.” Id., at\n307. In the words of the Strauder Court: “The very fact that\ncolored people are singled out and expressly denied by a statute\nall right to participate in the administration of the law, as\njurors, because of their color, though they are citizens, and may\nbe in other respects fully qualified, is practically a brand upon\nthem, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority, and a\nstimulant to that race prejudice which is an impediment to securing\nto individuals of the race that equal justice which the law aims to\nsecure to all others.” Id ., at 308. For those reasons, the\nCourt ruled that the West Virginia statute exclud- ing blacks from\njury service violated the Fourteenth Amendment. As the Court later explained in Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U.S.\n483 (1954), the Court’s decisions in the Slaughter-House\nCases and Strauder interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment\n“as proscribing all state-imposed discriminations against the Negro\nrace,” including in jury service. Brown , 347 U. S., at\n490. In the decades after Strauder , the Court\nreiterated that States may not discriminate on the basis of race in\njury selection. See, e.g., Neal v. Delaware , 103 U.S.\n370 , 397 (1881); Carter v. Texas , 177 U.S.\n442 , 447 (1900); Norris v. Alabama , 294 U.S.\n587 , 597–599 (1935); Hale v. Kentucky , 303 U.S.\n613 , 616 (1938) ( per curiam ); Pierre v. Louisiana , 306 U.S.\n354 , 362 (1939); Smith v. Texas , 311 U.S.\n128 , 130–131 (1940); Avery v. Georgia , 345 U.S.\n559 , 562 (1953); Hernandez v. Texas , 347 U.S.\n475 , 477–478, 482 (1954); Coleman v. Alabama , 377 U.S.\n129 , 133 (1964). But critical problems persisted. Even though\nlaws barring blacks from serving on juries were unconstitutional\nafter Strauder , many jurisdictions employed various\ndiscriminatory tools to prevent black persons from being called for\njury service. And when those tactics failed, or were invalidated,\nprosecutors could still exercise peremptory strikes in individual\ncases to remove most or all black prospective jurors. In the century after Strauder , the\nfreedom to exercise peremptory strikes for any reason meant that\n“the problem of racial exclusion from jury service” remained\n“widespread” and “deeply entrenched.” 5 U. S. Commission on\nCivil Rights Report 90 (1961). Simple math shows how that happened.\nGiven that blacks were a minority of the population, in many\njurisdictions the number of peremp-tory strikes available to the\nprosecutor exceeded the number of black prospective jurors. So\nprosecutors could routinely exercise peremptories to strike all the\nblack prospective jurors and thereby ensure all-white juries. The\nexclusion of black prospective jurors was almost total in certain\njurisdictions, especially in cases involving black defendants.\nSimilarly, defense counsel could use—and routinely did\nuse—peremptory challenges to strike all the black prospective\njurors in cases involving white defendants and black victims. In the aftermath of Strauder , the\nexclusion of black jurors became more covert and less overt—often\naccomplished through peremptory challenges in individual courtrooms\nrather than by blanket operation of law. But as this Court later\nnoted, the results were the same for black jurors and black\ndefendants, as well as for the black community’s confidence in the\nfairness of the American criminal justice system. See Batson , 476 U. S., at 98–99. Eighty-five years after Strauder , the\nCourt decided Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S.\n202 (1965). The defendant Swain was black. Swain was convicted\nof a capital offense in Talladega County, Alabama, and sentenced to\ndeath. Swain presented evidence that no black juror had served on a\njury in Talladega County in more than a decade. See id . , at 226. And in Swain’s case, the prosecutor\nstruck all six qualified black prospective jurors, ensuring that\nSwain was tried before an all-white jury. Swain invoked Strauder to argue that the prosecutor in his case had\nimpermis-sibly discriminated on the basis of race by using\nperemptory challenges to strike the six black prospective jurors.\nSee 380 U. S., at 203, 210. This Court ruled that Swain had not established\nunconstitutional discrimination. Most importantly, the Court held\nthat a defendant could not object to the State’s use of peremptory\nstrikes in an individual case. In the Court’s words: “[W]e cannot\nhold that the striking of Negroes in a particular case is a denial\nof equal protection of the laws.” Id., at 221. The Swain Court reasoned that prosecutors do not always judge\nprospective jurors individually when exercising peremptory strikes.\nInstead, prosecutors choose which prospective jurors to strike “in\nlight of the limited knowledge counsel has of them, which may\ninclude their group affiliations, in the context of the case to be\ntried.” Ibid . In the Court’s view, the prosecutor could\nstrike prospective jurors on the basis of their group affiliations,\nincluding race. In other words, a prosecutor could permissibly\nstrike a prospective juror for any reason, including the assumption\nor belief that a black prospective juror, because of race, would be\nfavorable to a black defendant or unfavorable to the State. See id., at 220–221. To be sure, the Swain Court held that a\ndefendant could make out a case of racial discrimination by showing\nthat the State “in case after case, whatever the circumstances,\nwhatever the crime and whoever the defendant or the victim may be,”\nhad been responsible for the removal of qualified black prospective\njurors so that no black jurors “ever serve on petit juries.” Id., at 223. But Swain ’s high bar for establishing a\nconstitutional violation was almost impossible for any defendant to\nsurmount, as the aftermath of Swain amply\ndemonstrated . Twenty-one years later, in its 1986 decision in Batson , the Court revisited several critical aspects of Swain and in essence overruled them. In so doing, the Batson Court emphasized that “the central concern” of the\nFourteenth Amendment “was to put an end to governmental\ndiscrimination on account of race.” 476 U. S., at 85. The Batson Court noted that Swain had left prosecutors’\nperemptory challenges “largely immune from constitutional\nscrutiny.” 476 U. S., at 92–93. In his concurrence in Batson , Justice Byron White (the author of Swain )\nagreed that Swain should be overruled. He stated: “[T]he\npractice of peremptorily eliminating blacks from petit juries in\ncases with black defendants remains widespread, so much so” that “I\nagree with the Court that the time has come to rule as it has.” 476\nU. S., at 101–102. Under Batson , once a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination has been shown by a defendant, the State must\nprovide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes. The trial\njudge must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated reasons were\nthe actual reasons or instead were a pretext for discrimination. Id., at 97–98. Four parts of Batson warrant particular\nemphasis here. First , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s insistence that a defendant demonstrate a history of\nracially discriminatory strikes in order to make out a claim of\nrace discrimination. See 476 U. S., at 95. According to the Batson Court, defendants had run into “practical\ndifficulties” in trying to prove that a State had systematically\n“exercised peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury on\naccount of race.” Id ., at 92, n. 17. The Batson Court\nexplained that, in some jurisdictions, requiring a defendant to\n“investigate, over a number of cases, the race of persons tried in\nthe particular jurisdiction, the racial composition of the venire\nand petit jury, and the manner in which both parties exercised\ntheir peremptory challenges” posed an “insurmountable” burden. Ibid . In addition to that practical point, the Court\nstressed a basic equal protection point: In the eyes of the\nConstitution, one racially discriminatory peremptory strike is one\ntoo many. For those reasons, the Batson Court held\nthat a criminal defendant could show “purposeful discrimination in\nselection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the\nprosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges at the\ndefendant’s trial .” Id ., at 96 (emphasis added). Second , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s statement that a prosecutor could strike a black\njuror based on an assumption or belief that the black juror would\nfavor a black defendant. In some of the most critical sentences in\nthe Batson opinion, the Court emphasized that a prosecutor\nmay not rebut a claim of discrimination “by stating merely that he\nchallenged jurors of the defendant’s race on the assumption—or his\nintuitive judgment—that they would be partial to the defendant\nbecause of their shared race.” 476 U. S., at 97. The Court\nelaborated: The Equal Protection Clause “forbids the States to\nstrike black veniremen on the assumption that they will be biased\nin a particular case simply because the defendant is black. The\ncore guarantee of equal protection, ensuring citizens that their\nState will not discriminate on account of race, would be\nmeaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors on the basis\nof such assumptions, which arise solely from the jurors’ race.” Id., at 97–98. In his concurrence, Justice Thurgood Marshall\ndrove the point home: “Exclusion of blacks from a jury, solely\nbecause of race, can no more be justified",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus Flowers v. Mississippi certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi No. 17–9572. Argued March 20, 2019—Decided\nJune 21, 2019 Petitioner Curtis Flowers has been tried six\nseparate times for the murder of four employees of a Mississippi\nfurniture store. Flowers is black; three of the four victims were\nwhite. At the first two trials, the State used its peremptory\nstrikes on all of the qualified black prospective jurors. In each\ncase, the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death, but\nthe convictions were later reversed by the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt based on prosecutorial misconduct. At the third trial, the\nState used all of its 15 peremptory strikes against black\nprospective jurors, and the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed again, this\ntime concluding that the State exercised its peremptory strikes on\nthe basis of race in violation of Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 . Flowers’ fourth and fifth trials ended in mistrials. At the\nfourth, the State exercised 11 peremptory strikes—all against black\nprospective jurors. No available racial information exists about\nthe prospective jurors in the fifth trial. At the sixth trial, the\nState exercised six peremptory strikes—five against black\nprospective jurors, allowing one black juror to be seated. Flowers\nagain raised a Batson claim, but the trial court concluded\nthat the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each of the\nfive peremptory strikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed. After this\nCourt vacated that judgment and remanded in light of Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt again upheld Flowers’ conviction in a divided 5-to-4\ndecision. Justice King dissented on the Batson issue and was\njoined by two other Justices. Held : All of the relevant facts\nand circumstances taken together establish that the trial court at\nFlowers’ sixth trial committed clear error in concluding that the\nState’s peremptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright\nwas not motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.\nPp. 7–31. (a) Under Batson , once a prima\nfacie case of discrimination has been shown by a defendant, the\nState must provide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes.\nThe trial judge then must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated\nreasons were the actual reasons or instead were a pretext for\ndiscrimination. The Batson Court rejected four arguments.\nFirst, the Batson Court rejected the idea that a defendant\nmust demonstrate a history of racially discriminatory strikes in\norder to make out a claim of race discrimination. Second, the Batson Court rejected the argument that a prosecutor could\nstrike a black juror based on an assumption or belief that the\nblack juror would favor a black defendant. Third, the Batson Court rejected the argument that race-based peremptories should be\npermissible because black, white, Asian, and Hispanic defendants\nand jurors were all “equally” subject to race-based discrimination.\nFourth, the Batson Court rejected the argument that\nrace-based peremptories are permissible because both the\nprosecution and defense could employ them in any individual case\nand in essence balance things out. Pp. 7–15. (b) Four categories of evidence loom\nlarge in assessing the Batson issue here, where the State\nhad a persistent pattern of striking black prospective jurors from\nFlowers’ first through his sixth trial. Pp. 15–30. (1) A review of the history of the\nState’s peremptory strikes in Flowers’ first four trials strongly\nsupports the conclusion that the State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial was motivated in substantial part by\ndiscriminatory intent. The State tried to strike all 36 black\nprospective jurors over the course of the first four trials. And\nthe state courts themselves concluded that the State had violated Batson on two separate occasions . The State’s\nrelentless, determined effort to rid the jury of black individuals\nstrongly suggests that the State wanted to try Flowers before a\njury with as few black jurors as possible, and ideally before an\nall-white jury. Pp. 19–22. (2) The State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial followed the same pattern as the first four\ntrials. Pp. 22–23. (3) Disparate questioning can be\nprobative of discriminatory intent. Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U.S.\n322 , 331–332, 344–345. Here, the State spent far more time\nquestioning the black prospective jurors than the accepted white\njurors—145 questions asked of 5 black prospective jurors and 12\nquestions asked of 11 white seated jurors. The record refutes the\nState’s explanation that it questioned black and white prospective\njurors differently only because of differences in the jurors’\ncharacteristics. Along with the historical evidence from the\nearlier trials, as well as the State’s striking of five of six\nblack prospective jurors at the sixth trial, the dramatically\ndisparate questioning and investigation of black prospective jurors\nand white prospective jurors at the sixth trial strongly suggest\nthat the State was motivated in substantial part by a\ndiscriminatory intent. Pp. 23–26. (4) Comparing prospective jurors who were\nstruck and not struck can be an important step in determining\nwhether a Batson violation occurred. See Snyder v. Louisiana , 552 U.S.\n472 , 483–484. Here, Carolyn Wright, a black prospective juror,\nwas struck, the State says, in part because she knew several\ndefense witnesses and had worked at Wal-Mart where Flowers’ father\nalso worked. But three white prospective jurors also knew many\nindividuals involved in the case, and the State asked them no\nindividual questions about their connections to witnesses. White\nprospective jurors also had relationships with members of Flowers’\nfamily, but the State did not ask them follow-up questions in order\nto explore the depth of those relationships. The State also\nincorrectly explained that it exercised a peremptory strike against\nWright because she had worked with one of Flowers’ sisters and made\napparently incorrect statements to justify the strikes of other\nblack prospective jurors. When considered with other evidence, a\nseries of factually inaccurate explanations for striking black\nprospective jurors can be another clue showing discriminatory\nintent. The overall context here requires skepticism of the State’s\nstrike of Carolyn Wright. The trial court at Flowers’ sixth trial\ncommitted clear error in concluding that the State’s peremptory\nstrike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not motivated\nin substantial part by discriminatory intent. Pp. 26–30. 240 So. 3d 1082, reversed and remanded. Kavanaugh, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 17–9572 _________________ CURTIS GIOVANNI FLOWERS, PETITIONER v. MISSISSIPPI on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi [June 21, 2019] Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. In Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 (1986), this Court ruled that a State may not discriminate\non the basis of race when exercising peremptory challenges against\nprospective jurors in a criminal trial. In 1996, Curtis Flowers allegedly murdered four\npeople in Winona, Mississippi. Flowers is black. He has been tried\nsix separate times before a jury for murder. The same lead\nprosecutor represented the State in all six trials. In the initial three trials, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed each\nconviction. In the first trial, Flowers was convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to “numerous\ninstances of prosecutorial misconduct.” Flowers v. State , 773 So. 2d 309, 327 (2000). In the second trial, the\ntrial court found that the prosecutor discriminated on the basis of\nrace in the peremptory challenge of a black juror. The trial court\nseated the black juror. Flowers was then convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court again reversed the conviction because of\nprosecutorial misconduct at trial. In the third trial, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court yet again reversed the\nconviction, this time because the court concluded that the\nprosecutor had again discriminated against black prospective jurors\nin the jury selection process. The court’s lead opinion stated:\n“The instant case presents us with as strong a prima facie case of\nracial discrimination as we have ever seen in the context of a Batson challenge.” Flowers v. State , 947 So.\n2d 910, 935 (2007). The opinion further stated that the “State\nengaged in racially discriminatory practices during the jury\nselection process” and that the “case evinces an effort by the\nState to exclude African-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. The fourth and fifth trials of Flowers ended in\nmistrials due to hung juries. In his sixth trial, which is the one at issue\nhere, Flowers was convicted. The State struck five of the six black\nprospective jurors. On appeal, Flowers argued that the State again\nviolated Batson in exercising peremptory strikes against\nblack prospective jurors. In a divided 5-to-4 decision, the\nMississippi Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. We granted\ncertiorari on the Batson question and now reverse. See 586\nU. S. ___ (2018). Four critical facts, taken together, require\nreversal. First , in the six trials combined, the State\nemployed its peremptory challenges to strike 41 of the 42 black\nprospective jurors that it could have struck—a statistic that the\nState acknowledged at oral argument in this Court. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n32. Second , in the most recent trial, the sixth trial, the\nState exercised peremptory strikes against five of the six black\nprospective jurors. Third , at the sixth trial, in an\napparent effort to find pretextual reasons to strike black\nprospective jurors, the State engaged in dramatically disparate\nquestioning of black and white prospective jurors. Fourth ,\nthe State then struck at least one black prospective juror, Carolyn\nWright, who was similarly situated to white prospective jurors who\nwere not struck by the State. We need not and do not decide that any one of\nthose four facts alone would require reversal. All that we need to\ndecide, and all that we do decide, is that all of the relevant\nfacts and circumstances taken together establish that the trial\ncourt committed clear error in concluding that the State’s\nperemptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not\n“motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.” Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016)\n(slip op., at 23) (internal quotation marks omitted). In reaching\nthat conclusion, we break no new legal ground. We simply enforce\nand reinforce Batson by applying it to the extraordinary\nfacts of this case. We reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of\nMississippi, and we remand the case for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion. I The underlying events that gave rise to this\ncase took place in Winona, Mississippi. Winona is a small town in\nnorthern Mississippi, just off I–55 almost halfway between Jackson\nand Memphis. The total population of Winona is about 5,000. The\ntown is about 53 percent black and about 46 percent white. In 1996, Bertha Tardy, Robert Golden, Derrick\nStewart, and Carmen Rigby were murdered at the Tardy Furniture\nstore in Winona. All four victims worked at the Tardy Furniture\nstore. Three of the four victims were white; one was black. In\n1997, the State charged Curtis Flowers with murder. Flowers is\nblack. Since then, Flowers has been tried six separate times for\nthe murders. In each of the first two trials, Flowers was tried for\none individual murder. In each subsequent trial, Flowers was tried\nfor all four of the murders together. The same state prosecutor\ntried Flowers each time. The prosecutor is white. At Flowers’ first trial, 36 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 31 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nThe State exercised a total of 12 peremptory strikes, and it used 5\nof them to strike the five qualified black prospective jurors.\nFlowers objected, arguing under Batson that the State had\nexercised its peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory\nmanner. The trial court rejected the Batson challenge.\nBecause the trial court allowed the State’s peremptory strikes,\nFlowers was tried in front of an all-white jury. The jury convicted\nFlowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court\nreversed the conviction, concluding that the State had committed\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, expressing baseless grounds for doubting the credibility of\nwitnesses and mentioning facts that had not been allowed into\nevidence by the trial judge. Flowers , 773 So. 2d, at\n317, 334. In its opinion, the Mississippi Supreme Court described\n“numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct” at the trial. Id., at 327. Because the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed\nbased on prosecutorial misconduct at trial, the court did not reach\nFlowers’ Batson argument. See Flowers , 773\nSo. 2d, at 327 . At the second trial, 30 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 25 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nAs in Flowers’ first trial, the State again used its strikes\nagainst all five black prospective jurors. But this time, the trial\ncourt determined that the State’s asserted reason for one of the\nstrikes was a pretext for discrimination. Specifically, the trial\ncourt determined that one of the State’s proffered reasons—that the\njuror had been inattentive and was nodding off during jury\nselection—for striking that juror was false, and the trial court\ntherefore sustained Flowers’ Batson challenge. The trial\ncourt disallowed the strike and sat that black juror on the jury.\nThe jury at Flowers’ second trial consisted of 11 white jurors and\n1 black juror. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to\ndeath. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court again\nreversed. The court ruled that the prosecutor had again engaged in\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, impermissibly referencing evidence and attempting to\nundermine witness credibility without a factual basis. See Flowers v. State , 842 So. 2d 531, 538, 553\n(2003). At Flowers’ third trial, 45 prospective\njurors—17 black and 28 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. One of the black prospective jurors was struck for cause,\nleaving 16. The State exercised a total of 15 peremptory strikes,\nand it used all 15 against black prospective jurors. Flowers again\nargued that the State had used its peremptory strikes in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner. The trial court found that the State had not\ndiscriminated on the basis of race. See Flowers , 947\nSo. 2d, at 916. The jury in Flowers’ third trial consisted of\n11 white jurors and 1 black juror. The lone black juror who served\non the jury was seated after the State ran out of peremptory\nstrikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court yet\nagain reversed, concluding that the State had again violated Batson by discriminating on the basis of race in exercising\nall 15 of its peremptory strikes against 15 black prospective\njurors. See Flowers , 947 So. 2d, at 939. The court’s\nlead opinion stated: “The instant case presents us with as strong a\nprima facie case of racial discrimination as we have ever seen in\nthe context of a Batson challenge.” Id., at 935. The\nopinion explained that although “each individual strike may have\njustifiably appeared to the trial court to be sufficiently race\nneutral, the trial court also has a duty to look at the State’s use\nof peremptory challenges in toto .” Id., at 937.\nThe opinion emphasized that “trial judges should not blindly accept\nany and every reason put forth by the State, especially” when “the\nState continues to exercise challenge after challenge only upon\nmembers of a particular race.” Ibid . The opinion added that\nthe “State engaged in racially discriminatory practices” and that\nthe “case evinces an effort by the State to exclude\nAfrican-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. At Flowers’ fourth trial, 36 prospective\njurors—16 black and 20 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. The State exercised a total of 11 peremptory strikes, and\nit used all 11 against black prospective jurors. But because of the\nrelatively large number of prospective jurors who were black, the\nState did not have enough peremptory challenges to eliminate all of\nthe black prospective jurors. The seated jury consisted of seven\nwhite jurors and five black jurors. That jury could not reach a\nverdict, and the proceeding ended in a mistrial. As to the fifth trial, there is no available\nracial information about the prospective jurors, as distinct from\nthe jurors who ultimately sat on the jury. The jury was composed of\nnine white jurors and three black jurors. The jury could not reach\na verdict, and the trial again ended in a mistrial. At the sixth trial, which we consider here, 26\nprospective jurors—6 black and 20 white—were presented to\npotentially serve on the jury. The State exercised a total of six\nperemptory strikes, and it used five of the six against black\nprospective jurors, leaving one black juror to sit on the jury.\nFlowers again argued that the State had exercised its peremptory\nstrikes in a racially discrimina-tory manner. The trial court\nconcluded that the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each\nof the five peremp-tory strikes against the five black prospective\njurors. The jury at Flowers’ sixth trial consisted of 11 white\njurors and 1 black juror. That jury convicted Flowers of murder and\nsentenced him to death. In a divided decision, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt agreed with the trial court on the Batson issue and\nstated that the State’s “race-neutral reasons were valid and not\nmerely pretextual.” Flowers v. State , 158 So. 3d\n1009, 1058 (2014). Flowers then sought review in this Court. This\nCourt granted Flowers’ petition for a writ of certio-rari, vacated\nthe judgment of the Mississippi Supreme Court, and remanded for\nfurther consideration in light of the decision in Foster ,\n578 U. S. ___. Flowers v. Mississippi , 579\nU. S. ___ (2016). In Foster , this Court held that the\ndefendant Foster had established a Batson violation. 578\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 25). On remand, the Mississippi Supreme Court by a\n5-to-4 vote again upheld Flowers’ conviction. See 240 So. 3d 1082\n(2017). Justice King wrote a dissent for three justices. He stated:\n“I cannot conclude that Flowers received a fair trial, nor can I\nconclude that prospective jurors were not subjected to\nimpermissible discrimination.” Id ., at 1172. According to\nJustice King, both the trial court and the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt “completely disregard[ed] the constitutional right of\nprospective jurors to be free from a racially discriminatory\nselection process.” Id., at 1171. We granted certiorari. See\n586 U. S. ___. II A Other than voting, serving on a jury is the\nmost substantial opportunity that most citizens have to participate\nin the democratic process. See Powers v. Ohio , 499 U.S.\n400 , 407 (1991). Jury selection in criminal cases varies\nsignificantly based on state and local rules and practices, but\nordinarily consists of three phases, which we describe here in\ngeneral terms. First , a group of citizens in the community\nis randomly summoned to the courthouse on a particular day for\npotential jury service. Second , a subgroup of those\nprospective jurors is called into a particular courtroom for a\nspecific case. The prospective jurors are often questioned by the\njudge, as well as by the prosecutor and defense attorney. During\nthat second phase, the judge may excuse certain prospective jurors\nbased on their answers. Third , the prosecutor and defense\nattorney may challenge certain prospective jurors. The attorneys\nmay challenge prospective jurors for cause, which usually stems\nfrom a potential juror’s conflicts of interest or inability to be\nimpartial. In addition to challenges for cause, each side is\ntypically afforded a set number of peremptory challenges or\nstrikes. Peremptory strikes have very old credentials and can be\ntraced back to the common law. Those peremptory strikes\ntraditionally may be used to remove any potential juror for any\nreason—no questions asked. That blanket discretion to peremptorily strike\nprospective jurors for any reason can clash with the dictates of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. This case arises at the intersection of\nthe peremptory challenge and the Equal Protection Clause. And to\nunderstand how equal protection law applies to peremptory\nchallenges, it helps to begin at the beginning. Ratified in 1868 in the wake of the Civil War,\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides\nthat no State shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\nequal protection of the laws.” A primary objective of the Equal\nProtection Clause, this Court stated just five years after\nratification, was “the freedom of the slave race, the security and\nfirm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the\nnewly-made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who\nhad formerly exercised unlimited dominion over him.” Slaughter-House Cases , 16 Wall. 36, 71 (1873). In 1875, to help enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Congress passed and President Ulysses S. Grant signed\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1875. Ch. 114, 18Stat. 335. Among other\nthings, that law made it a criminal offense for state officials to\nexclude individuals from jury service on account of their race. 18\nU. S. C. §243. The Act provides: “No citizen possessing\nall other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by law\nshall be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any\ncourt of the United States, or of any State on account of race,\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.” In 1880, just 12 years after ratification of the\nFourteenth Amendment, the Court decided Strauder v. West\nVirginia , 100 U.S.\n303 . That case concerned a West Virginia statute that allowed\nwhites only to serve as jurors. The Court held the law\nunconstitutional. In reaching its conclusion, the Court explained\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment required “that the law in the States\nshall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons,\nwhether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the\nStates, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose protection\nthe amendment was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall\nbe made against them by law because of their color.” Id., at\n307. In the words of the Strauder Court: “The very fact that\ncolored people are singled out and expressly denied by a statute\nall right to participate in the administration of the law, as\njurors, because of their color, though they are citizens, and may\nbe in other respects fully qualified, is practically a brand upon\nthem, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority, and a\nstimulant to that race prejudice which is an impediment to securing\nto individuals of the race that equal justice which the law aims to\nsecure to all others.” Id ., at 308. For those reasons, the\nCourt ruled that the West Virginia statute exclud- ing blacks from\njury service violated the Fourteenth Amendment. As the Court later explained in Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U.S.\n483 (1954), the Court’s decisions in the Slaughter-House\nCases and Strauder interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment\n“as proscribing all state-imposed discriminations against the Negro\nrace,” including in jury service. Brown , 347 U. S., at\n490. In the decades after Strauder , the Court\nreiterated that States may not discriminate on the basis of race in\njury selection. See, e.g., Neal v. Delaware , 103 U.S.\n370 , 397 (1881); Carter v. Texas , 177 U.S.\n442 , 447 (1900); Norris v. Alabama , 294 U.S.\n587 , 597–599 (1935); Hale v. Kentucky , 303 U.S.\n613 , 616 (1938) ( per curiam ); Pierre v. Louisiana , 306 U.S.\n354 , 362 (1939); Smith v. Texas , 311 U.S.\n128 , 130–131 (1940); Avery v. Georgia , 345 U.S.\n559 , 562 (1953); Hernandez v. Texas , 347 U.S.\n475 , 477–478, 482 (1954); Coleman v. Alabama , 377 U.S.\n129 , 133 (1964). But critical problems persisted. Even though\nlaws barring blacks from serving on juries were unconstitutional\nafter Strauder , many jurisdictions employed various\ndiscriminatory tools to prevent black persons from being called for\njury service. And when those tactics failed, or were invalidated,\nprosecutors could still exercise peremptory strikes in individual\ncases to remove most or all black prospective jurors. In the century after Strauder , the\nfreedom to exercise peremptory strikes for any reason meant that\n“the problem of racial exclusion from jury service” remained\n“widespread” and “deeply entrenched.” 5 U. S. Commission on\nCivil Rights Report 90 (1961). Simple math shows how that happened.\nGiven that blacks were a minority of the population, in many\njurisdictions the number of peremp-tory strikes available to the\nprosecutor exceeded the number of black prospective jurors. So\nprosecutors could routinely exercise peremptories to strike all the\nblack prospective jurors and thereby ensure all-white juries. The\nexclusion of black prospective jurors was almost total in certain\njurisdictions, especially in cases involving black defendants.\nSimilarly, defense counsel could use—and routinely did\nuse—peremptory challenges to strike all the black prospective\njurors in cases involving white defendants and black victims. In the aftermath of Strauder , the\nexclusion of black jurors became more covert and less overt—often\naccomplished through peremptory challenges in individual courtrooms\nrather than by blanket operation of law. But as this Court later\nnoted, the results were the same for black jurors and black\ndefendants, as well as for the black community’s confidence in the\nfairness of the American criminal justice system. See Batson , 476 U. S., at 98–99. Eighty-five years after Strauder , the\nCourt decided Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S.\n202 (1965). The defendant Swain was black. Swain was convicted\nof a capital offense in Talladega County, Alabama, and sentenced to\ndeath. Swain presented evidence that no black juror had served on a\njury in Talladega County in more than a decade. See id . , at 226. And in Swain’s case, the prosecutor\nstruck all six qualified black prospective jurors, ensuring that\nSwain was tried before an all-white jury. Swain invoked Strauder to argue that the prosecutor in his case had\nimpermis-sibly discriminated on the basis of race by using\nperemptory challenges to strike the six black prospective jurors.\nSee 380 U. S., at 203, 210. This Court ruled that Swain had not established\nunconstitutional discrimination. Most importantly, the Court held\nthat a defendant could not object to the State’s use of peremptory\nstrikes in an individual case. In the Court’s words: “[W]e cannot\nhold that the striking of Negroes in a particular case is a denial\nof equal protection of the laws.” Id., at 221. The Swain Court reasoned that prosecutors do not always judge\nprospective jurors individually when exercising peremptory strikes.\nInstead, prosecutors choose which prospective jurors to strike “in\nlight of the limited knowledge counsel has of them, which may\ninclude their group affiliations, in the context of the case to be\ntried.” Ibid . In the Court’s view, the prosecutor could\nstrike prospective jurors on the basis of their group affiliations,\nincluding race. In other words, a prosecutor could permissibly\nstrike a prospective juror for any reason, including the assumption\nor belief that a black prospective juror, because of race, would be\nfavorable to a black defendant or unfavorable to the State. See id., at 220–221. To be sure, the Swain Court held that a\ndefendant could make out a case of racial discrimination by showing\nthat the State “in case after case, whatever the circumstances,\nwhatever the crime and whoever the defendant or the victim may be,”\nhad been responsible for the removal of qualified black prospective\njurors so that no black jurors “ever serve on petit juries.” Id., at 223. But Swain ’s high bar for establishing a\nconstitutional violation was almost impossible for any defendant to\nsurmount, as the aftermath of Swain amply\ndemonstrated . Twenty-one years later, in its 1986 decision in Batson , the Court revisited several critical aspects of Swain and in essence overruled them. In so doing, the Batson Court emphasized that “the central concern” of the\nFourteenth Amendment “was to put an end to governmental\ndiscrimination on account of race.” 476 U. S., at 85. The Batson Court noted that Swain had left prosecutors’\nperemptory challenges “largely immune from constitutional\nscrutiny.” 476 U. S., at 92–93. In his concurrence in Batson , Justice Byron White (the author of Swain )\nagreed that Swain should be overruled. He stated: “[T]he\npractice of peremptorily eliminating blacks from petit juries in\ncases with black defendants remains widespread, so much so” that “I\nagree with the Court that the time has come to rule as it has.” 476\nU. S., at 101–102. Under Batson , once a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination has been shown by a defendant, the State must\nprovide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes. The trial\njudge must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated reasons were\nthe actual reasons or instead were a pretext for discrimination. Id., at 97–98. Four parts of Batson warrant particular\nemphasis here. First , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s insistence that a defendant demonstrate a history of\nracially discriminatory strikes in order to make out a claim of\nrace discrimination. See 476 U. S., at 95. According to the Batson Court, defendants had run into “practical\ndifficulties” in trying to prove that a State had systematically\n“exercised peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury on\naccount of race.” Id ., at 92, n. 17. The Batson Court\nexplained that, in some jurisdictions, requiring a defendant to\n“investigate, over a number of cases, the race of persons tried in\nthe particular jurisdiction, the racial composition of the venire\nand petit jury, and the manner in which both parties exercised\ntheir peremptory challenges” posed an “insurmountable” burden. Ibid . In addition to that practical point, the Court\nstressed a basic equal protection point: In the eyes of the\nConstitution, one racially discriminatory peremptory strike is one\ntoo many. For those reasons, the Batson Court held\nthat a criminal defendant could show “purposeful discrimination in\nselection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the\nprosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges at the\ndefendant’s trial .” Id ., at 96 (emphasis added). Second , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s statement that a prosecutor could strike a black\njuror based on an assumption or belief that the black juror would\nfavor a black defendant. In some of the most critical sentences in\nthe Batson opinion, the Court emphasized that a prosecutor\nmay not rebut a claim of discrimination “by stating merely that he\nchallenged jurors of the defendant’s race on the assumption—or his\nintuitive judgment—that they would be partial to the defendant\nbecause of their shared race.” 476 U. S., at 97. The Court\nelaborated: The Equal Protection Clause “forbids the States to\nstrike black veniremen on the assumption that they will be biased\nin a particular case simply because the defendant is black. The\ncore guarantee of equal protection, ensuring citizens that their\nState will not discriminate on account of race, would be\nmeaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors on the basis\nof such assumptions, which arise solely from the jurors’ race.” Id., at 97–98. In his concurrence, Justice Thurgood Marshall\ndrove the point home: “Exclusion of blacks from a jury, solely\nbecause of race, can no more be justified",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus Flowers v. Mississippi certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi No. 17–9572. Argued March 20, 2019—Decided\nJune 21, 2019 Petitioner Curtis Flowers has been tried six\nseparate times for the murder of four employees of a Mississippi\nfurniture store. Flowers is black; three of the four victims were\nwhite. At the first two trials, the State used its peremptory\nstrikes on all of the qualified black prospective jurors. In each\ncase, the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death, but\nthe convictions were later reversed by the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt based on prosecutorial misconduct. At the third trial, the\nState used all of its 15 peremptory strikes against black\nprospective jurors, and the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed again, this\ntime concluding that the State exercised its peremptory strikes on\nthe basis of race in violation of Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 . Flowers’ fourth and fifth trials ended in mistrials. At the\nfourth, the State exercised 11 peremptory strikes—all against black\nprospective jurors. No available racial information exists about\nthe prospective jurors in the fifth trial. At the sixth trial, the\nState exercised six peremptory strikes—five against black\nprospective jurors, allowing one black juror to be seated. Flowers\nagain raised a Batson claim, but the trial court concluded\nthat the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each of the\nfive peremptory strikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed. After this\nCourt vacated that judgment and remanded in light of Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt again upheld Flowers’ conviction in a divided 5-to-4\ndecision. Justice King dissented on the Batson issue and was\njoined by two other Justices. Held : All of the relevant facts\nand circumstances taken together establish that the trial court at\nFlowers’ sixth trial committed clear error in concluding that the\nState’s peremptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright\nwas not motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.\nPp. 7–31. (a) Under Batson , once a prima\nfacie case of discrimination has been shown by a defendant, the\nState must provide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes.\nThe trial judge then must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated\nreasons were the actual reasons or instead were a pretext for\ndiscrimination. The Batson Court rejected four arguments.\nFirst, the Batson Court rejected the idea that a defendant\nmust demonstrate a history of racially discriminatory strikes in\norder to make out a claim of race discrimination. Second, the Batson Court rejected the argument that a prosecutor could\nstrike a black juror based on an assumption or belief that the\nblack juror would favor a black defendant. Third, the Batson Court rejected the argument that race-based peremptories should be\npermissible because black, white, Asian, and Hispanic defendants\nand jurors were all “equally” subject to race-based discrimination.\nFourth, the Batson Court rejected the argument that\nrace-based peremptories are permissible because both the\nprosecution and defense could employ them in any individual case\nand in essence balance things out. Pp. 7–15. (b) Four categories of evidence loom\nlarge in assessing the Batson issue here, where the State\nhad a persistent pattern of striking black prospective jurors from\nFlowers’ first through his sixth trial. Pp. 15–30. (1) A review of the history of the\nState’s peremptory strikes in Flowers’ first four trials strongly\nsupports the conclusion that the State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial was motivated in substantial part by\ndiscriminatory intent. The State tried to strike all 36 black\nprospective jurors over the course of the first four trials. And\nthe state courts themselves concluded that the State had violated Batson on two separate occasions . The State’s\nrelentless, determined effort to rid the jury of black individuals\nstrongly suggests that the State wanted to try Flowers before a\njury with as few black jurors as possible, and ideally before an\nall-white jury. Pp. 19–22. (2) The State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial followed the same pattern as the first four\ntrials. Pp. 22–23. (3) Disparate questioning can be\nprobative of discriminatory intent. Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U.S.\n322 , 331–332, 344–345. Here, the State spent far more time\nquestioning the black prospective jurors than the accepted white\njurors—145 questions asked of 5 black prospective jurors and 12\nquestions asked of 11 white seated jurors. The record refutes the\nState’s explanation that it questioned black and white prospective\njurors differently only because of differences in the jurors’\ncharacteristics. Along with the historical evidence from the\nearlier trials, as well as the State’s striking of five of six\nblack prospective jurors at the sixth trial, the dramatically\ndisparate questioning and investigation of black prospective jurors\nand white prospective jurors at the sixth trial strongly suggest\nthat the State was motivated in substantial part by a\ndiscriminatory intent. Pp. 23–26. (4) Comparing prospective jurors who were\nstruck and not struck can be an important step in determining\nwhether a Batson violation occurred. See Snyder v. Louisiana , 552 U.S.\n472 , 483–484. Here, Carolyn Wright, a black prospective juror,\nwas struck, the State says, in part because she knew several\ndefense witnesses and had worked at Wal-Mart where Flowers’ father\nalso worked. But three white prospective jurors also knew many\nindividuals involved in the case, and the State asked them no\nindividual questions about their connections to witnesses. White\nprospective jurors also had relationships with members of Flowers’\nfamily, but the State did not ask them follow-up questions in order\nto explore the depth of those relationships. The State also\nincorrectly explained that it exercised a peremptory strike against\nWright because she had worked with one of Flowers’ sisters and made\napparently incorrect statements to justify the strikes of other\nblack prospective jurors. When considered with other evidence, a\nseries of factually inaccurate explanations for striking black\nprospective jurors can be another clue showing discriminatory\nintent. The overall context here requires skepticism of the State’s\nstrike of Carolyn Wright. The trial court at Flowers’ sixth trial\ncommitted clear error in concluding that the State’s peremptory\nstrike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not motivated\nin substantial part by discriminatory intent.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 17–9572 _________________ CURTIS GIOVANNI FLOWERS, PETITIONER v. MISSISSIPPI on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi [June 21, 2019] Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. In Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 (1986), this Court ruled that a State may not discriminate\non the basis of race when exercising peremptory challenges against\nprospective jurors in a criminal trial. In 1996, Curtis Flowers allegedly murdered four\npeople in Winona, Mississippi. Flowers is black. He has been tried\nsix separate times before a jury for murder. The same lead\nprosecutor represented the State in all six trials. In the initial three trials, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed each\nconviction. In the first trial, Flowers was convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to “numerous\ninstances of prosecutorial misconduct.” Flowers v. State , 773 So. 2d 309, 327 (2000). In the second trial, the\ntrial court found that the prosecutor discriminated on the basis of\nrace in the peremptory challenge of a black juror. The trial court\nseated the black juror. Flowers was then convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court again reversed the conviction because of\nprosecutorial misconduct at trial. In the third trial, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court yet again reversed the\nconviction, this time because the court concluded that the\nprosecutor had again discriminated against black prospective jurors\nin the jury selection process. The court’s lead opinion stated:\n“The instant case presents us with as strong a prima facie case of\nracial discrimination as we have ever seen in the context of a Batson challenge.” Flowers v. State , 947 So.\n2d 910, 935 (2007). The opinion further stated that the “State\nengaged in racially discriminatory practices during the jury\nselection process” and that the “case evinces an effort by the\nState to exclude African-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. The fourth and fifth trials of Flowers ended in\nmistrials due to hung juries. In his sixth trial, which is the one at issue\nhere, Flowers was convicted. The State struck five of the six black\nprospective jurors. On appeal, Flowers argued that the State again\nviolated Batson in exercising peremptory strikes against\nblack prospective jurors. In a divided 5-to-4 decision, the\nMississippi Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. We granted\ncertiorari on the Batson question and now reverse. See 586\nU. S. ___ (2018). Four critical facts, taken together, require\nreversal. First , in the six trials combined, the State\nemployed its peremptory challenges to strike 41 of the 42 black\nprospective jurors that it could have struck—a statistic that the\nState acknowledged at oral argument in this Court. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n32. Second , in the most recent trial, the sixth trial, the\nState exercised peremptory strikes against five of the six black\nprospective jurors. Third , at the sixth trial, in an\napparent effort to find pretextual reasons to strike black\nprospective jurors, the State engaged in dramatically disparate\nquestioning of black and white prospective jurors. Fourth ,\nthe State then struck at least one black prospective juror, Carolyn\nWright, who was similarly situated to white prospective jurors who\nwere not struck by the State. We need not and do not decide that any one of\nthose four facts alone would require reversal. All that we need to\ndecide, and all that we do decide, is that all of the relevant\nfacts and circumstances taken together establish that the trial\ncourt committed clear error in concluding that the State’s\nperemptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not\n“motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.” Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016)\n(slip op., at 23) (internal quotation marks omitted). In reaching\nthat conclusion, we break no new legal ground. We simply enforce\nand reinforce Batson by applying it to the extraordinary\nfacts of this case. We reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of\nMississippi, and we remand the case for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion. I The underlying events that gave rise to this\ncase took place in Winona, Mississippi. Winona is a small town in\nnorthern Mississippi, just off I–55 almost halfway between Jackson\nand Memphis. The total population of Winona is about 5,000. The\ntown is about 53 percent black and about 46 percent white. In 1996, Bertha Tardy, Robert Golden, Derrick\nStewart, and Carmen Rigby were murdered at the Tardy Furniture\nstore in Winona. All four victims worked at the Tardy Furniture\nstore. Three of the four victims were white; one was black. In\n1997, the State charged Curtis Flowers with murder. Flowers is\nblack. Since then, Flowers has been tried six separate times for\nthe murders. In each of the first two trials, Flowers was tried for\none individual murder. In each subsequent trial, Flowers was tried\nfor all four of the murders together. The same state prosecutor\ntried Flowers each time. The prosecutor is white. At Flowers’ first trial, 36 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 31 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nThe State exercised a total of 12 peremptory strikes, and it used 5\nof them to strike the five qualified black prospective jurors.\nFlowers objected, arguing under Batson that the State had\nexercised its peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory\nmanner. The trial court rejected the Batson challenge.\nBecause the trial court allowed the State’s peremptory strikes,\nFlowers was tried in front of an all-white jury. The jury convicted\nFlowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court\nreversed the conviction, concluding that the State had committed\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, expressing baseless grounds for doubting the credibility of\nwitnesses and mentioning facts that had not been allowed into\nevidence by the trial judge. Flowers , 773 So. 2d, at\n317, 334. In its opinion, the Mississippi Supreme Court described\n“numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct” at the trial. Id., at 327. Because the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed\nbased on prosecutorial misconduct at trial, the court did not reach\nFlowers’ Batson argument. See Flowers , 773\nSo. 2d, at 327 . At the second trial, 30 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 25 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nAs in Flowers’ first trial, the State again used its strikes\nagainst all five black prospective jurors. But this time, the trial\ncourt determined that the State’s asserted reason for one of the\nstrikes was a pretext for discrimination. Specifically, the trial\ncourt determined that one of the State’s proffered reasons—that the\njuror had been inattentive and was nodding off during jury\nselection—for striking that juror was false, and the trial court\ntherefore sustained Flowers’ Batson challenge. The trial\ncourt disallowed the strike and sat that black juror on the jury.\nThe jury at Flowers’ second trial consisted of 11 white jurors and\n1 black juror. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to\ndeath. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court again\nreversed. The court ruled that the prosecutor had again engaged in\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, impermissibly referencing evidence and attempting to\nundermine witness credibility without a factual basis. See Flowers v. State , 842 So. 2d 531, 538, 553\n(2003). At Flowers’ third trial, 45 prospective\njurors—17 black and 28 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. One of the black prospective jurors was struck for cause,\nleaving 16. The State exercised a total of 15 peremptory strikes,\nand it used all 15 against black prospective jurors. Flowers again\nargued that the State had used its peremptory strikes in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner. The trial court found that the State had not\ndiscriminated on the basis of race. See Flowers , 947\nSo. 2d, at 916. The jury in Flowers’ third trial consisted of\n11 white jurors and 1 black juror. The lone black juror who served\non the jury was seated after the State ran out of peremptory\nstrikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court yet\nagain reversed, concluding that the State had again violated Batson by discriminating on the basis of race in exercising\nall 15 of its peremptory strikes against 15 black prospective\njurors. See Flowers , 947 So. 2d, at 939. The court’s\nlead opinion stated: “The instant case presents us with as strong a\nprima facie case of racial discrimination as we have ever seen in\nthe context of a Batson challenge.” Id., at 935. The\nopinion explained that although “each individual strike may have\njustifiably appeared to the trial court to be sufficiently race\nneutral, the trial court also has a duty to look at the State’s use\nof peremptory challenges in toto .” Id., at 937.\nThe opinion emphasized that “trial judges should not blindly accept\nany and every reason put forth by the State, especially” when “the\nState continues to exercise challenge after challenge only upon\nmembers of a particular race.” Ibid . The opinion added that\nthe “State engaged in racially discriminatory practices” and that\nthe “case evinces an effort by the State to exclude\nAfrican-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. At Flowers’ fourth trial, 36 prospective\njurors—16 black and 20 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. The State exercised a total of 11 peremptory strikes, and\nit used all 11 against black prospective jurors. But because of the\nrelatively large number of prospective jurors who were black, the\nState did not have enough peremptory challenges to eliminate all of\nthe black prospective jurors. The seated jury consisted of seven\nwhite jurors and five black jurors. That jury could not reach a\nverdict, and the proceeding ended in a mistrial. As to the fifth trial, there is no available\nracial information about the prospective jurors, as distinct from\nthe jurors who ultimately sat on the jury. The jury was composed of\nnine white jurors and three black jurors. The jury could not reach\na verdict, and the trial again ended in a mistrial. At the sixth trial, which we consider here, 26\nprospective jurors—6 black and 20 white—were presented to\npotentially serve on the jury. The State exercised a total of six\nperemptory strikes, and it used five of the six against black\nprospective jurors, leaving one black juror to sit on the jury.\nFlowers again argued that the State had exercised its peremptory\nstrikes in a racially discrimina-tory manner. The trial court\nconcluded that the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each\nof the five peremp-tory strikes against the five black prospective\njurors. The jury at Flowers’ sixth trial consisted of 11 white\njurors and 1 black juror. That jury convicted Flowers of murder and\nsentenced him to death. In a divided decision, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt agreed with the trial court on the Batson issue and\nstated that the State’s “race-neutral reasons were valid and not\nmerely pretextual.” Flowers v. State , 158 So. 3d\n1009, 1058 (2014). Flowers then sought review in this Court. This\nCourt granted Flowers’ petition for a writ of certio-rari, vacated\nthe judgment of the Mississippi Supreme Court, and remanded for\nfurther consideration in light of the decision in Foster ,\n578 U. S. ___. Flowers v. Mississippi , 579\nU. S. ___ (2016). In Foster , this Court held that the\ndefendant Foster had established a Batson violation. 578\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 25). On remand, the Mississippi Supreme Court by a\n5-to-4 vote again upheld Flowers’ conviction. See 240 So. 3d 1082\n(2017). Justice King wrote a dissent for three justices. He stated:\n“I cannot conclude that Flowers received a fair trial, nor can I\nconclude that prospective jurors were not subjected to\nimpermissible discrimination.” Id ., at 1172. According to\nJustice King, both the trial court and the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt “completely disregard[ed] the constitutional right of\nprospective jurors to be free from a racially discriminatory\nselection process.” Id., at 1171. We granted certiorari. See\n586 U. S. ___. II A Other than voting, serving on a jury is the\nmost substantial opportunity that most citizens have to participate\nin the democratic process. See Powers v. Ohio , 499 U.S.\n400 , 407 (1991). Jury selection in criminal cases varies\nsignificantly based on state and local rules and practices, but\nordinarily consists of three phases, which we describe here in\ngeneral terms. First , a group of citizens in the community\nis randomly summoned to the courthouse on a particular day for\npotential jury service. Second , a subgroup of those\nprospective jurors is called into a particular courtroom for a\nspecific case. The prospective jurors are often questioned by the\njudge, as well as by the prosecutor and defense attorney. During\nthat second phase, the judge may excuse certain prospective jurors\nbased on their answers. Third , the prosecutor and defense\nattorney may challenge certain prospective jurors. The attorneys\nmay challenge prospective jurors for cause, which usually stems\nfrom a potential juror’s conflicts of interest or inability to be\nimpartial. In addition to challenges for cause, each side is\ntypically afforded a set number of peremptory challenges or\nstrikes. Peremptory strikes have very old credentials and can be\ntraced back to the common law. Those peremptory strikes\ntraditionally may be used to remove any potential juror for any\nreason—no questions asked. That blanket discretion to peremptorily strike\nprospective jurors for any reason can clash with the dictates of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. This case arises at the intersection of\nthe peremptory challenge and the Equal Protection Clause. And to\nunderstand how equal protection law applies to peremptory\nchallenges, it helps to begin at the beginning. Ratified in 1868 in the wake of the Civil War,\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides\nthat no State shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\nequal protection of the laws.” A primary objective of the Equal\nProtection Clause, this Court stated just five years after\nratification, was “the freedom of the slave race, the security and\nfirm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the\nnewly-made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who\nhad formerly exercised unlimited dominion over him.” Slaughter-House Cases , 16 Wall. 36, 71 (1873). In 1875, to help enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Congress passed and President Ulysses S. Grant signed\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1875. Ch. 114, 18Stat. 335. Among other\nthings, that law made it a criminal offense for state officials to\nexclude individuals from jury service on account of their race. 18\nU. S. C. §243. The Act provides: “No citizen possessing\nall other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by law\nshall be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any\ncourt of the United States, or of any State on account of race,\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.” In 1880, just 12 years after ratification of the\nFourteenth Amendment, the Court decided Strauder v. West\nVirginia , 100 U.S.\n303 . That case concerned a West Virginia statute that allowed\nwhites only to serve as jurors. The Court held the law\nunconstitutional. In reaching its conclusion, the Court explained\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment required “that the law in the States\nshall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons,\nwhether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the\nStates, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose protection\nthe amendment was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall\nbe made against them by law because of their color.” Id., at\n307. In the words of the Strauder Court: “The very fact that\ncolored people are singled out and expressly denied by a statute\nall right to participate in the administration of the law, as\njurors, because of their color, though they are citizens, and may\nbe in other respects fully qualified, is practically a brand upon\nthem, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority, and a\nstimulant to that race prejudice which is an impediment to securing\nto individuals of the race that equal justice which the law aims to\nsecure to all others.” Id ., at 308. For those reasons, the\nCourt ruled that the West Virginia statute exclud- ing blacks from\njury service violated the Fourteenth Amendment. As the Court later explained in Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U.S.\n483 (1954), the Court’s decisions in the Slaughter-House\nCases and Strauder interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment\n“as proscribing all state-imposed discriminations against the Negro\nrace,” including in jury service. Brown , 347 U. S., at\n490. In the decades after Strauder , the Court\nreiterated that States may not discriminate on the basis of race in\njury selection. See, e.g., Neal v. Delaware , 103 U.S.\n370 , 397 (1881); Carter v. Texas , 177 U.S.\n442 , 447 (1900); Norris v. Alabama , 294 U.S.\n587 , 597–599 (1935); Hale v. Kentucky , 303 U.S.\n613 , 616 (1938) ( per curiam ); Pierre v. Louisiana , 306 U.S.\n354 , 362 (1939); Smith v. Texas , 311 U.S.\n128 , 130–131 (1940); Avery v. Georgia , 345 U.S.\n559 , 562 (1953); Hernandez v. Texas , 347 U.S.\n475 , 477–478, 482 (1954); Coleman v. Alabama , 377 U.S.\n129 , 133 (1964). But critical problems persisted. Even though\nlaws barring blacks from serving on juries were unconstitutional\nafter Strauder , many jurisdictions employed various\ndiscriminatory tools to prevent black persons from being called for\njury service. And when those tactics failed, or were invalidated,\nprosecutors could still exercise peremptory strikes in individual\ncases to remove most or all black prospective jurors. In the century after Strauder , the\nfreedom to exercise peremptory strikes for any reason meant that\n“the problem of racial exclusion from jury service” remained\n“widespread” and “deeply entrenched.” 5 U. S. Commission on\nCivil Rights Report 90 (1961). Simple math shows how that happened.\nGiven that blacks were a minority of the population, in many\njurisdictions the number of peremp-tory strikes available to the\nprosecutor exceeded the number of black prospective jurors. So\nprosecutors could routinely exercise peremptories to strike all the\nblack prospective jurors and thereby ensure all-white juries. The\nexclusion of black prospective jurors was almost total in certain\njurisdictions, especially in cases involving black defendants.\nSimilarly, defense counsel could use—and routinely did\nuse—peremptory challenges to strike all the black prospective\njurors in cases involving white defendants and black victims. In the aftermath of Strauder , the\nexclusion of black jurors became more covert and less overt—often\naccomplished through peremptory challenges in individual courtrooms\nrather than by blanket operation of law. But as this Court later\nnoted, the results were the same for black jurors and black\ndefendants, as well as for the black community’s confidence in the\nfairness of the American criminal justice system. See Batson , 476 U. S., at 98–99. Eighty-five years after Strauder , the\nCourt decided Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S.\n202 (1965). The defendant Swain was black. Swain was convicted\nof a capital offense in Talladega County, Alabama, and sentenced to\ndeath. Swain presented evidence that no black juror had served on a\njury in Talladega County in more than a decade. See id . , at 226. And in Swain’s case, the prosecutor\nstruck all six qualified black prospective jurors, ensuring that\nSwain was tried before an all-white jury. Swain invoked Strauder to argue that the prosecutor in his case had\nimpermis-sibly discriminated on the basis of race by using\nperemptory challenges to strike the six black prospective jurors.\nSee 380 U. S., at 203, 210. This Court ruled that Swain had not established\nunconstitutional discrimination. Most importantly, the Court held\nthat a defendant could not object to the State’s use of peremptory\nstrikes in an individual case. In the Court’s words: “[W]e cannot\nhold that the striking of Negroes in a particular case is a denial\nof equal protection of the laws.” Id., at 221. The Swain Court reasoned that prosecutors do not always judge\nprospective jurors individually when exercising peremptory strikes.\nInstead, prosecutors choose which prospective jurors to strike “in\nlight of the limited knowledge counsel has of them, which may\ninclude their group affiliations, in the context of the case to be\ntried.” Ibid . In the Court’s view, the prosecutor could\nstrike prospective jurors on the basis of their group affiliations,\nincluding race. In other words, a prosecutor could permissibly\nstrike a prospective juror for any reason, including the assumption\nor belief that a black prospective juror, because of race, would be\nfavorable to a black defendant or unfavorable to the State. See id., at 220–221. To be sure, the Swain Court held that a\ndefendant could make out a case of racial discrimination by showing\nthat the State “in case after case, whatever the circumstances,\nwhatever the crime and whoever the defendant or the victim may be,”\nhad been responsible for the removal of qualified black prospective\njurors so that no black jurors “ever serve on petit juries.” Id., at 223. But Swain ’s high bar for establishing a\nconstitutional violation was almost impossible for any defendant to\nsurmount, as the aftermath of Swain amply\ndemonstrated . Twenty-one years later, in its 1986 decision in Batson , the Court revisited several critical aspects of Swain and in essence overruled them. In so doing, the Batson Court emphasized that “the central concern” of the\nFourteenth Amendment “was to put an end to governmental\ndiscrimination on account of race.” 476 U. S., at 85. The Batson Court noted that Swain had left prosecutors’\nperemptory challenges “largely immune from constitutional\nscrutiny.” 476 U. S., at 92–93. In his concurrence in Batson , Justice Byron White (the author of Swain )\nagreed that Swain should be overruled. He stated: “[T]he\npractice of peremptorily eliminating blacks from petit juries in\ncases with black defendants remains widespread, so much so” that “I\nagree with the Court that the time has come to rule as it has.” 476\nU. S., at 101–102. Under Batson , once a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination has been shown by a defendant, the State must\nprovide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes. The trial\njudge must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated reasons were\nthe actual reasons or instead were a pretext for discrimination. Id., at 97–98. Four parts of Batson warrant particular\nemphasis here. First , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s insistence that a defendant demonstrate a history of\nracially discriminatory strikes in order to make out a claim of\nrace discrimination. See 476 U. S., at 95. According to the Batson Court, defendants had run into “practical\ndifficulties” in trying to prove that a State had systematically\n“exercised peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury on\naccount of race.” Id ., at 92, n. 17. The Batson Court\nexplained that, in some jurisdictions, requiring a defendant to\n“investigate, over a number of cases, the race of persons tried in\nthe particular jurisdiction, the racial composition of the venire\nand petit jury, and the manner in which both parties exercised\ntheir peremptory challenges” posed an “insurmountable” burden. Ibid . In addition to that practical point, the Court\nstressed a basic equal protection point: In the eyes of the\nConstitution, one racially discriminatory peremptory strike is one\ntoo many. For those reasons, the Batson Court held\nthat a criminal defendant could show “purposeful discrimination in\nselection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the\nprosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges at the\ndefendant’s trial .” Id ., at 96 (emphasis added). Second , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s statement that a prosecutor could strike a black\njuror based on an assumption or belief that the black juror would\nfavor a black defendant. In some of the most critical sentences in\nthe Batson opinion, the Court emphasized that a prosecutor\nmay not rebut a claim of discrimination “by stating merely that he\nchallenged jurors of the defendant’s race on the assumption—or his\nintuitive judgment—that they would be partial to the defendant\nbecause of their shared race.” 476 U. S., at 97. The Court\nelaborated: The Equal Protection Clause “forbids the States to\nstrike black veniremen on the assumption that they will be biased\nin a particular case simply because the defendant is black. The\ncore guarantee of equal protection, ensuring citizens that their\nState will not discriminate on account of race, would be\nmeaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors on the basis\nof such assumptions, which arise solely from the jurors’ race.” Id., at 97–98. In his concurrence, Justice Thurgood Marshall\ndrove the point home: “Exclusion of blacks from a jury, solely\nbecause of race, can no more be justified",
    "textpassage": "\"Carolyn Wright, a black prospective juror, was struck, the State says, in part because she knew several defense witnesses and had worked at Wal-Mart where Flowers’ father also worked. But three white prospective jurors also knew many individuals involved in the case, and the State asked them no individual questions about their connections to witnesses.\""

Mississippi certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi No. 17–9572. Argued March 20, 2019—Decided\nJune 21, 2019 Petitioner Curtis Flowers has been tried six\nseparate times for the murder of four employees of a Mississippi\nfurniture store. Flowers is black; three of the four victims were\nwhite. At the first two trials, the State used its peremptory\nstrikes on all of the qualified black prospective jurors. In each\ncase, the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death, but\nthe convictions were later reversed by the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt based on prosecutorial misconduct. At the third trial, the\nState used all of its 15 peremptory strikes against black\nprospective jurors, and the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed again, this\ntime concluding that the State exercised its peremptory strikes on\nthe basis of race in violation of Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 . Flowers’ fourth and fifth trials ended in mistrials. At the\nfourth, the State exercised 11 peremptory strikes—all against black\nprospective jurors. No available racial information exists about\nthe prospective jurors in the fifth trial. At the sixth trial, the\nState exercised six peremptory strikes—five against black\nprospective jurors, allowing one black juror to be seated. Flowers\nagain raised a Batson claim, but the trial court concluded\nthat the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each of the\nfive peremptory strikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed. After this\nCourt vacated that judgment and remanded in light of Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt again upheld Flowers’ conviction in a divided 5-to-4\ndecision. Justice King dissented on the Batson issue and was\njoined by two other Justices. Held : All of the relevant facts\nand circumstances taken together establish that the trial court at\nFlowers’ sixth trial committed clear error in concluding that the\nState’s peremptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright\nwas not motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.\nPp. 7–31. (a) Under Batson , once a prima\nfacie case of discrimination has been shown by a defendant, the\nState must provide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes.\nThe trial judge then must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated\nreasons were the actual reasons or instead were a pretext for\ndiscrimination. The Batson Court rejected four arguments.\nFirst, the Batson Court rejected the idea that a defendant\nmust demonstrate a history of racially discriminatory strikes in\norder to make out a claim of race discrimination. Second, the Batson Court rejected the argument that a prosecutor could\nstrike a black juror based on an assumption or belief that the\nblack juror would favor a black defendant. Third, the Batson Court rejected the argument that race-based peremptories should be\npermissible because black, white, Asian, and Hispanic defendants\nand jurors were all “equally” subject to race-based discrimination.\nFourth, the Batson Court rejected the argument that\nrace-based peremptories are permissible because both the\nprosecution and defense could employ them in any individual case\nand in essence balance things out. Pp. 7–15. (b) Four categories of evidence loom\nlarge in assessing the Batson issue here, where the State\nhad a persistent pattern of striking black prospective jurors from\nFlowers’ first through his sixth trial. Pp. 15–30. (1) A review of the history of the\nState’s peremptory strikes in Flowers’ first four trials strongly\nsupports the conclusion that the State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial was motivated in substantial part by\ndiscriminatory intent. The State tried to strike all 36 black\nprospective jurors over the course of the first four trials. And\nthe state courts themselves concluded that the State had violated Batson on two separate occasions . The State’s\nrelentless, determined effort to rid the jury of black individuals\nstrongly suggests that the State wanted to try Flowers before a\njury with as few black jurors as possible, and ideally before an\nall-white jury. Pp. 19–22. (2) The State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial followed the same pattern as the first four\ntrials. Pp. 22–23. (3) Disparate questioning can be\nprobative of discriminatory intent. Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U.S.\n322 , 331–332, 344–345. Here, the State spent far more time\nquestioning the black prospective jurors than the accepted white\njurors—145 questions asked of 5 black prospective jurors and 12\nquestions asked of 11 white seated jurors. The record refutes the\nState’s explanation that it questioned black and white prospective\njurors differently only because of differences in the jurors’\ncharacteristics. Along with the historical evidence from the\nearlier trials, as well as the State’s striking of five of six\nblack prospective jurors at the sixth trial, the dramatically\ndisparate questioning and investigation of black prospective jurors\nand white prospective jurors at the sixth trial strongly suggest\nthat the State was motivated in substantial part by a\ndiscriminatory intent. Pp. 23–26. (4) Comparing prospective jurors who were\nstruck and not struck can be an important step in determining\nwhether a Batson violation occurred. See Snyder v. Louisiana , 552 U.S.\n472 , 483–484. Here, Carolyn Wright, a black prospective juror,\nwas struck, the State says, in part because she knew several\ndefense witnesses and had worked at Wal-Mart where Flowers’ father\nalso worked. But three white prospective jurors also knew many\nindividuals involved in the case, and the State asked them no\nindividual questions about their connections to witnesses. White\nprospective jurors also had relationships with members of Flowers’\nfamily, but the State did not ask them follow-up questions in order\nto explore the depth of those relationships. The State also\nincorrectly explained that it exercised a peremptory strike against\nWright because she had worked with one of Flowers’ sisters and made\napparently incorrect statements to justify the strikes of other\nblack prospective jurors. When considered with other evidence, a\nseries of factually inaccurate explanations for striking black\nprospective jurors can be another clue showing discriminatory\nintent. The overall context here requires skepticism of the State’s\nstrike of Carolyn Wright. The trial court at Flowers’ sixth trial\ncommitted clear error in concluding that the State’s peremptory\nstrike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not motivated\nin substantial part by discriminatory intent.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 17–9572 _________________ CURTIS GIOVANNI FLOWERS, PETITIONER v. MISSISSIPPI on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi [June 21, 2019] Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. In Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 (1986), this Court ruled that a State may not discriminate\non the basis of race when exercising peremptory challenges against\nprospective jurors in a criminal trial. In 1996, Curtis Flowers allegedly murdered four\npeople in Winona, Mississippi. Flowers is black. He has been tried\nsix separate times before a jury for murder. The same lead\nprosecutor represented the State in all six trials. In the initial three trials, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed each\nconviction. In the first trial, Flowers was convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to “numerous\ninstances of prosecutorial misconduct.” Flowers v. State , 773 So. 2d 309, 327 (2000). In the second trial, the\ntrial court found that the prosecutor discriminated on the basis of\nrace in the peremptory challenge of a black juror. The trial court\nseated the black juror. Flowers was then convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court again reversed the conviction because of\nprosecutorial misconduct at trial. In the third trial, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court yet again reversed the\nconviction, this time because the court concluded that the\nprosecutor had again discriminated against black prospective jurors\nin the jury selection process. The court’s lead opinion stated:\n“The instant case presents us with as strong a prima facie case of\nracial discrimination as we have ever seen in the context of a Batson challenge.” Flowers v. State , 947 So.\n2d 910, 935 (2007). The opinion further stated that the “State\nengaged in racially discriminatory practices during the jury\nselection process” and that the “case evinces an effort by the\nState to exclude African-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. The fourth and fifth trials of Flowers ended in\nmistrials due to hung juries. In his sixth trial, which is the one at issue\nhere, Flowers was convicted. The State struck five of the six black\nprospective jurors. On appeal, Flowers argued that the State again\nviolated Batson in exercising peremptory strikes against\nblack prospective jurors. In a divided 5-to-4 decision, the\nMississippi Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. We granted\ncertiorari on the Batson question and now reverse. See 586\nU. S. ___ (2018). Four critical facts, taken together, require\nreversal. First , in the six trials combined, the State\nemployed its peremptory challenges to strike 41 of the 42 black\nprospective jurors that it could have struck—a statistic that the\nState acknowledged at oral argument in this Court. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n32. Second , in the most recent trial, the sixth trial, the\nState exercised peremptory strikes against five of the six black\nprospective jurors. Third , at the sixth trial, in an\napparent effort to find pretextual reasons to strike black\nprospective jurors, the State engaged in dramatically disparate\nquestioning of black and white prospective jurors. Fourth ,\nthe State then struck at least one black prospective juror, Carolyn\nWright, who was similarly situated to white prospective jurors who\nwere not struck by the State. We need not and do not decide that any one of\nthose four facts alone would require reversal. All that we need to\ndecide, and all that we do decide, is that all of the relevant\nfacts and circumstances taken together establish that the trial\ncourt committed clear error in concluding that the State’s\nperemptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not\n“motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.” Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016)\n(slip op., at 23) (internal quotation marks omitted). In reaching\nthat conclusion, we break no new legal ground. We simply enforce\nand reinforce Batson by applying it to the extraordinary\nfacts of this case. We reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of\nMississippi, and we remand the case for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion. I The underlying events that gave rise to this\ncase took place in Winona, Mississippi. Winona is a small town in\nnorthern Mississippi, just off I–55 almost halfway between Jackson\nand Memphis. The total population of Winona is about 5,000. The\ntown is about 53 percent black and about 46 percent white. In 1996, Bertha Tardy, Robert Golden, Derrick\nStewart, and Carmen Rigby were murdered at the Tardy Furniture\nstore in Winona. All four victims worked at the Tardy Furniture\nstore. Three of the four victims were white; one was black. In\n1997, the State charged Curtis Flowers with murder. Flowers is\nblack. Since then, Flowers has been tried six separate times for\nthe murders. In each of the first two trials, Flowers was tried for\none individual murder. In each subsequent trial, Flowers was tried\nfor all four of the murders together. The same state prosecutor\ntried Flowers each time. The prosecutor is white. At Flowers’ first trial, 36 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 31 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nThe State exercised a total of 12 peremptory strikes, and it used 5\nof them to strike the five qualified black prospective jurors.\nFlowers objected, arguing under Batson that the State had\nexercised its peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory\nmanner. The trial court rejected the Batson challenge.\nBecause the trial court allowed the State’s peremptory strikes,\nFlowers was tried in front of an all-white jury. The jury convicted\nFlowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court\nreversed the conviction, concluding that the State had committed\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, expressing baseless grounds for doubting the credibility of\nwitnesses and mentioning facts that had not been allowed into\nevidence by the trial judge. Flowers , 773 So. 2d, at\n317, 334. In its opinion, the Mississippi Supreme Court described\n“numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct” at the trial. Id., at 327. Because the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed\nbased on prosecutorial misconduct at trial, the court did not reach\nFlowers’ Batson argument. See Flowers , 773\nSo. 2d, at 327 . At the second trial, 30 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 25 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nAs in Flowers’ first trial, the State again used its strikes\nagainst all five black prospective jurors. But this time, the trial\ncourt determined that the State’s asserted reason for one of the\nstrikes was a pretext for discrimination. Specifically, the trial\ncourt determined that one of the State’s proffered reasons—that the\njuror had been inattentive and was nodding off during jury\nselection—for striking that juror was false, and the trial court\ntherefore sustained Flowers’ Batson challenge. The trial\ncourt disallowed the strike and sat that black juror on the jury.\nThe jury at Flowers’ second trial consisted of 11 white jurors and\n1 black juror. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to\ndeath. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court again\nreversed. The court ruled that the prosecutor had again engaged in\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, impermissibly referencing evidence and attempting to\nundermine witness credibility without a factual basis. See Flowers v. State , 842 So. 2d 531, 538, 553\n(2003). At Flowers’ third trial, 45 prospective\njurors—17 black and 28 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. One of the black prospective jurors was struck for cause,\nleaving 16. The State exercised a total of 15 peremptory strikes,\nand it used all 15 against black prospective jurors. Flowers again\nargued that the State had used its peremptory strikes in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner. The trial court found that the State had not\ndiscriminated on the basis of race. See Flowers , 947\nSo. 2d, at 916. The jury in Flowers’ third trial consisted of\n11 white jurors and 1 black juror. The lone black juror who served\non the jury was seated after the State ran out of peremptory\nstrikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court yet\nagain reversed, concluding that the State had again violated Batson by discriminating on the basis of race in exercising\nall 15 of its peremptory strikes against 15 black prospective\njurors. See Flowers , 947 So. 2d, at 939. The court’s\nlead opinion stated: “The instant case presents us with as strong a\nprima facie case of racial discrimination as we have ever seen in\nthe context of a Batson challenge.” Id., at 935. The\nopinion explained that although “each individual strike may have\njustifiably appeared to the trial court to be sufficiently race\nneutral, the trial court also has a duty to look at the State’s use\nof peremptory challenges in toto .” Id., at 937.\nThe opinion emphasized that “trial judges should not blindly accept\nany and every reason put forth by the State, especially” when “the\nState continues to exercise challenge after challenge only upon\nmembers of a particular race.” Ibid . The opinion added that\nthe “State engaged in racially discriminatory practices” and that\nthe “case evinces an effort by the State to exclude\nAfrican-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. At Flowers’ fourth trial, 36 prospective\njurors—16 black and 20 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. The State exercised a total of 11 peremptory strikes, and\nit used all 11 against black prospective jurors. But because of the\nrelatively large number of prospective jurors who were black, the\nState did not have enough peremptory challenges to eliminate all of\nthe black prospective jurors. The seated jury consisted of seven\nwhite jurors and five black jurors. That jury could not reach a\nverdict, and the proceeding ended in a mistrial. As to the fifth trial, there is no available\nracial information about the prospective jurors, as distinct from\nthe jurors who ultimately sat on the jury. The jury was composed of\nnine white jurors and three black jurors. The jury could not reach\na verdict, and the trial again ended in a mistrial. At the sixth trial, which we consider here, 26\nprospective jurors—6 black and 20 white—were presented to\npotentially serve on the jury. The State exercised a total of six\nperemptory strikes, and it used five of the six against black\nprospective jurors, leaving one black juror to sit on the jury.\nFlowers again argued that the State had exercised its peremptory\nstrikes in a racially discrimina-tory manner. The trial court\nconcluded that the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each\nof the five peremp-tory strikes against the five black prospective\njurors. The jury at Flowers’ sixth trial consisted of 11 white\njurors and 1 black juror. That jury convicted Flowers of murder and\nsentenced him to death. In a divided decision, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt agreed with the trial court on the Batson issue and\nstated that the State’s “race-neutral reasons were valid and not\nmerely pretextual.” Flowers v. State , 158 So. 3d\n1009, 1058 (2014). Flowers then sought review in this Court. This\nCourt granted Flowers’ petition for a writ of certio-rari, vacated\nthe judgment of the Mississippi Supreme Court, and remanded for\nfurther consideration in light of the decision in Foster ,\n578 U. S. ___. Flowers v. Mississippi , 579\nU. S. ___ (2016). In Foster , this Court held that the\ndefendant Foster had established a Batson violation. 578\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 25). On remand, the Mississippi Supreme Court by a\n5-to-4 vote again upheld Flowers’ conviction. See 240 So. 3d 1082\n(2017). Justice King wrote a dissent for three justices. He stated:\n“I cannot conclude that Flowers received a fair trial, nor can I\nconclude that prospective jurors were not subjected to\nimpermissible discrimination.” Id ., at 1172. According to\nJustice King, both the trial court and the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt “completely disregard[ed] the constitutional right of\nprospective jurors to be free from a racially discriminatory\nselection process.” Id., at 1171. We granted certiorari. See\n586 U. S. ___. II A Other than voting, serving on a jury is the\nmost substantial opportunity that most citizens have to participate\nin the democratic process. See Powers v. Ohio , 499 U.S.\n400 , 407 (1991). Jury selection in criminal cases varies\nsignificantly based on state and local rules and practices, but\nordinarily consists of three phases, which we describe here in\ngeneral terms. First , a group of citizens in the community\nis randomly summoned to the courthouse on a particular day for\npotential jury service. Second , a subgroup of those\nprospective jurors is called into a particular courtroom for a\nspecific case. The prospective jurors are often questioned by the\njudge, as well as by the prosecutor and defense attorney. During\nthat second phase, the judge may excuse certain prospective jurors\nbased on their answers. Third , the prosecutor and defense\nattorney may challenge certain prospective jurors. The attorneys\nmay challenge prospective jurors for cause, which usually stems\nfrom a potential juror’s conflicts of interest or inability to be\nimpartial. In addition to challenges for cause, each side is\ntypically afforded a set number of peremptory challenges or\nstrikes. Peremptory strikes have very old credentials and can be\ntraced back to the common law. Those peremptory strikes\ntraditionally may be used to remove any potential juror for any\nreason—no questions asked. That blanket discretion to peremptorily strike\nprospective jurors for any reason can clash with the dictates of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. This case arises at the intersection of\nthe peremptory challenge and the Equal Protection Clause. And to\nunderstand how equal protection law applies to peremptory\nchallenges, it helps to begin at the beginning. Ratified in 1868 in the wake of the Civil War,\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides\nthat no State shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\nequal protection of the laws.” A primary objective of the Equal\nProtection Clause, this Court stated just five years after\nratification, was “the freedom of the slave race, the security and\nfirm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the\nnewly-made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who\nhad formerly exercised unlimited dominion over him.” Slaughter-House Cases , 16 Wall. 36, 71 (1873). In 1875, to help enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Congress passed and President Ulysses S. Grant signed\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1875. Ch. 114, 18Stat. 335. Among other\nthings, that law made it a criminal offense for state officials to\nexclude individuals from jury service on account of their race. 18\nU. S. C. §243. The Act provides: “No citizen possessing\nall other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by law\nshall be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any\ncourt of the United States, or of any State on account of race,\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.” In 1880, just 12 years after ratification of the\nFourteenth Amendment, the Court decided Strauder v. West\nVirginia , 100 U.S.\n303 . That case concerned a West Virginia statute that allowed\nwhites only to serve as jurors. The Court held the law\nunconstitutional. In reaching its conclusion, the Court explained\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment required “that the law in the States\nshall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons,\nwhether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the\nStates, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose protection\nthe amendment was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall\nbe made against them by law because of their color.” Id., at\n307. In the words of the Strauder Court: “The very fact that\ncolored people are singled out and expressly denied by a statute\nall right to participate in the administration of the law, as\njurors, because of their color, though they are citizens, and may\nbe in other respects fully qualified, is practically a brand upon\nthem, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority, and a\nstimulant to that race prejudice which is an impediment to securing\nto individuals of the race that equal justice which the law aims to\nsecure to all others.” Id ., at 308. For those reasons, the\nCourt ruled that the West Virginia statute exclud- ing blacks from\njury service violated the Fourteenth Amendment. As the Court later explained in Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U.S.\n483 (1954), the Court’s decisions in the Slaughter-House\nCases and Strauder interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment\n“as proscribing all state-imposed discriminations against the Negro\nrace,” including in jury service. Brown , 347 U. S., at\n490. In the decades after Strauder , the Court\nreiterated that States may not discriminate on the basis of race in\njury selection. See, e.g., Neal v. Delaware , 103 U.S.\n370 , 397 (1881); Carter v. Texas , 177 U.S.\n442 , 447 (1900); Norris v. Alabama , 294 U.S.\n587 , 597–599 (1935); Hale v. Kentucky , 303 U.S.\n613 , 616 (1938) ( per curiam ); Pierre v. Louisiana , 306 U.S.\n354 , 362 (1939); Smith v. Texas , 311 U.S.\n128 , 130–131 (1940); Avery v. Georgia , 345 U.S.\n559 , 562 (1953); Hernandez v. Texas , 347 U.S.\n475 , 477–478, 482 (1954); Coleman v. Alabama , 377 U.S.\n129 , 133 (1964). But critical problems persisted. Even though\nlaws barring blacks from serving on juries were unconstitutional\nafter Strauder , many jurisdictions employed various\ndiscriminatory tools to prevent black persons from being called for\njury service. And when those tactics failed, or were invalidated,\nprosecutors could still exercise peremptory strikes in individual\ncases to remove most or all black prospective jurors. In the century after Strauder , the\nfreedom to exercise peremptory strikes for any reason meant that\n“the problem of racial exclusion from jury service” remained\n“widespread” and “deeply entrenched.” 5 U. S. Commission on\nCivil Rights Report 90 (1961). Simple math shows how that happened.\nGiven that blacks were a minority of the population, in many\njurisdictions the number of peremp-tory strikes available to the\nprosecutor exceeded the number of black prospective jurors. So\nprosecutors could routinely exercise peremptories to strike all the\nblack prospective jurors and thereby ensure all-white juries. The\nexclusion of black prospective jurors was almost total in certain\njurisdictions, especially in cases involving black defendants.\nSimilarly, defense counsel could use—and routinely did\nuse—peremptory challenges to strike all the black prospective\njurors in cases involving white defendants and black victims. In the aftermath of Strauder , the\nexclusion of black jurors became more covert and less overt—often\naccomplished through peremptory challenges in individual courtrooms\nrather than by blanket operation of law. But as this Court later\nnoted, the results were the same for black jurors and black\ndefendants, as well as for the black community’s confidence in the\nfairness of the American criminal justice system. See Batson , 476 U. S., at 98–99. Eighty-five years after Strauder , the\nCourt decided Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S.\n202 (1965). The defendant Swain was black. Swain was convicted\nof a capital offense in Talladega County, Alabama, and sentenced to\ndeath. Swain presented evidence that no black juror had served on a\njury in Talladega County in more than a decade. See id . , at 226. And in Swain’s case, the prosecutor\nstruck all six qualified black prospective jurors, ensuring that\nSwain was tried before an all-white jury. Swain invoked Strauder to argue that the prosecutor in his case had\nimpermis-sibly discriminated on the basis of race by using\nperemptory challenges to strike the six black prospective jurors.\nSee 380 U. S., at 203, 210. This Court ruled that Swain had not established\nunconstitutional discrimination. Most importantly, the Court held\nthat a defendant could not object to the State’s use of peremptory\nstrikes in an individual case. In the Court’s words: “[W]e cannot\nhold that the striking of Negroes in a particular case is a denial\nof equal protection of the laws.” Id., at 221. The Swain Court reasoned that prosecutors do not always judge\nprospective jurors individually when exercising peremptory strikes.\nInstead, prosecutors choose which prospective jurors to strike “in\nlight of the limited knowledge counsel has of them, which may\ninclude their group affiliations, in the context of the case to be\ntried.” Ibid . In the Court’s view, the prosecutor could\nstrike prospective jurors on the basis of their group affiliations,\nincluding race. In other words, a prosecutor could permissibly\nstrike a prospective juror for any reason, including the assumption\nor belief that a black prospective juror, because of race, would be\nfavorable to a black defendant or unfavorable to the State. See id., at 220–221. To be sure, the Swain Court held that a\ndefendant could make out a case of racial discrimination by showing\nthat the State “in case after case, whatever the circumstances,\nwhatever the crime and whoever the defendant or the victim may be,”\nhad been responsible for the removal of qualified black prospective\njurors so that no black jurors “ever serve on petit juries.” Id., at 223. But Swain ’s high bar for establishing a\nconstitutional violation was almost impossible for any defendant to\nsurmount, as the aftermath of Swain amply\ndemonstrated . Twenty-one years later, in its 1986 decision in Batson , the Court revisited several critical aspects of Swain and in essence overruled them. In so doing, the Batson Court emphasized that “the central concern” of the\nFourteenth Amendment “was to put an end to governmental\ndiscrimination on account of race.” 476 U. S., at 85. The Batson Court noted that Swain had left prosecutors’\nperemptory challenges “largely immune from constitutional\nscrutiny.” 476 U. S., at 92–93. In his concurrence in Batson , Justice Byron White (the author of Swain )\nagreed that Swain should be overruled. He stated: “[T]he\npractice of peremptorily eliminating blacks from petit juries in\ncases with black defendants remains widespread, so much so” that “I\nagree with the Court that the time has come to rule as it has.” 476\nU. S., at 101–102. Under Batson , once a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination has been shown by a defendant, the State must\nprovide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes. The trial\njudge must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated reasons were\nthe actual reasons or instead were a pretext for discrimination. Id., at 97–98. Four parts of Batson warrant particular\nemphasis here. First , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s insistence that a defendant demonstrate a history of\nracially discriminatory strikes in order to make out a claim of\nrace discrimination. See 476 U. S., at 95. According to the Batson Court, defendants had run into “practical\ndifficulties” in trying to prove that a State had systematically\n“exercised peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury on\naccount of race.” Id ., at 92, n. 17. The Batson Court\nexplained that, in some jurisdictions, requiring a defendant to\n“investigate, over a number of cases, the race of persons tried in\nthe particular jurisdiction, the racial composition of the venire\nand petit jury, and the manner in which both parties exercised\ntheir peremptory challenges” posed an “insurmountable” burden. Ibid . In addition to that practical point, the Court\nstressed a basic equal protection point: In the eyes of the\nConstitution, one racially discriminatory peremptory strike is one\ntoo many. For those reasons, the Batson Court held\nthat a criminal defendant could show “purposeful discrimination in\nselection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the\nprosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges at the\ndefendant’s trial .” Id ., at 96 (emphasis added). Second , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s statement that a prosecutor could strike a black\njuror based on an assumption or belief that the black juror would\nfavor a black defendant. In some of the most critical sentences in\nthe Batson opinion, the Court emphasized that a prosecutor\nmay not rebut a claim of discrimination “by stating merely that he\nchallenged jurors of the defendant’s race on the assumption—or his\nintuitive judgment—that they would be partial to the defendant\nbecause of their shared race.” 476 U. S., at 97. The Court\nelaborated: The Equal Protection Clause “forbids the States to\nstrike black veniremen on the assumption that they will be biased\nin a particular case simply because the defendant is black. The\ncore guarantee of equal protection, ensuring citizens that their\nState will not discriminate on account of race, would be\nmeaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors on the basis\nof such assumptions, which arise solely from the jurors’ race.” Id., at 97–98. In his concurrence, Justice Thurgood Marshall\ndrove the point home: “Exclusion of blacks from a jury, solely\nbecause of race, can no more be justified",

Mississippi certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi No. 17–9572. Argued March 20, 2019—Decided\nJune 21, 2019 Petitioner Curtis Flowers has been tried six\nseparate times for the murder of four employees of a Mississippi\nfurniture store. Flowers is black; three of the four victims were\nwhite. At the first two trials, the State used its peremptory\nstrikes on all of the qualified black prospective jurors. In each\ncase, the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death, but\nthe convictions were later reversed by the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt based on prosecutorial misconduct. At the third trial, the\nState used all of its 15 peremptory strikes against black\nprospective jurors, and the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed again, this\ntime concluding that the State exercised its peremptory strikes on\nthe basis of race in violation of Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 . Flowers’ fourth and fifth trials ended in mistrials. At the\nfourth, the State exercised 11 peremptory strikes—all against black\nprospective jurors. No available racial information exists about\nthe prospective jurors in the fifth trial. At the sixth trial, the\nState exercised six peremptory strikes—five against black\nprospective jurors, allowing one black juror to be seated. Flowers\nagain raised a Batson claim, but the trial court concluded\nthat the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each of the\nfive peremptory strikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed. After this\nCourt vacated that judgment and remanded in light of Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt again upheld Flowers’ conviction in a divided 5-to-4\ndecision. Justice King dissented on the Batson issue and was\njoined by two other Justices. Held : All of the relevant facts\nand circumstances taken together establish that the trial court at\nFlowers’ sixth trial committed clear error in concluding that the\nState’s peremptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright\nwas not motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.\nPp. 7–31. (a) Under Batson , once a prima\nfacie case of discrimination has been shown by a defendant, the\nState must provide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes.\nThe trial judge then must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated\nreasons were the actual reasons or instead were a pretext for\ndiscrimination. The Batson Court rejected four arguments.\nFirst, the Batson Court rejected the idea that a defendant\nmust demonstrate a history of racially discriminatory strikes in\norder to make out a claim of race discrimination. Second, the Batson Court rejected the argument that a prosecutor could\nstrike a black juror based on an assumption or belief that the\nblack juror would favor a black defendant. Third, the Batson Court rejected the argument that race-based peremptories should be\npermissible because black, white, Asian, and Hispanic defendants\nand jurors were all “equally” subject to race-based discrimination.\nFourth, the Batson Court rejected the argument that\nrace-based peremptories are permissible because both the\nprosecution and defense could employ them in any individual case\nand in essence balance things out. Pp. 7–15. (b) Four categories of evidence loom\nlarge in assessing the Batson issue here, where the State\nhad a persistent pattern of striking black prospective jurors from\nFlowers’ first through his sixth trial. Pp. 15–30. (1) A review of the history of the\nState’s peremptory strikes in Flowers’ first four trials strongly\nsupports the conclusion that the State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial was motivated in substantial part by\ndiscriminatory intent. The State tried to strike all 36 black\nprospective jurors over the course of the first four trials. And\nthe state courts themselves concluded that the State had violated Batson on two separate occasions . The State’s\nrelentless, determined effort to rid the jury of black individuals\nstrongly suggests that the State wanted to try Flowers before a\njury with as few black jurors as possible, and ideally before an\nall-white jury. Pp. 19–22. (2) The State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial followed the same pattern as the first four\ntrials. Pp. 22–23. (3) Disparate questioning can be\nprobative of discriminatory intent. Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U.S.\n322 , 331–332, 344–345. Here, the State spent far more time\nquestioning the black prospective jurors than the accepted white\njurors—145 questions asked of 5 black prospective jurors and 12\nquestions asked of 11 white seated jurors. The record refutes the\nState’s explanation that it questioned black and white prospective\njurors differently only because of differences in the jurors’\ncharacteristics. Along with the historical evidence from the\nearlier trials, as well as the State’s striking of five of six\nblack prospective jurors at the sixth trial, the dramatically\ndisparate questioning and investigation of black prospective jurors\nand white prospective jurors at the sixth trial strongly suggest\nthat the State was motivated in substantial part by a\ndiscriminatory intent. Pp. 23–26. (4) Comparing prospective jurors who were\nstruck and not struck can be an important step in determining\nwhether a Batson violation occurred. See Snyder v. Louisiana , 552 U.S.\n472 , 483–484. Here, Carolyn Wright, a black prospective juror,\nwas struck, the State says, in part because she knew several\ndefense witnesses and had worked at Wal-Mart where Flowers’ father\nalso worked. But three white prospective jurors also knew many\nindividuals involved in the case, and the State asked them no\nindividual questions about their connections to witnesses. White\nprospective jurors also had relationships with members of Flowers’\nfamily, but the State did not ask them follow-up questions in order\nto explore the depth of those relationships. The State also\nincorrectly explained that it exercised a peremptory strike against\nWright because she had worked with one of Flowers’ sisters and made\napparently incorrect statements to justify the strikes of other\nblack prospective jurors. When considered with other evidence, a\nseries of factually inaccurate explanations for striking black\nprospective jurors can be another clue showing discriminatory\nintent. The overall context here requires skepticism of the State’s\nstrike of Carolyn Wright. The trial court at Flowers’ sixth trial\ncommitted clear error in concluding that the State’s peremptory\nstrike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not motivated\nin substantial part by discriminatory intent. Pp. 26–30. 240 So. 3d 1082, reversed and remanded. Kavanaugh, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 17–9572 _________________ CURTIS GIOVANNI FLOWERS, PETITIONER v. MISSISSIPPI on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi [June 21, 2019] Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. In Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 (1986), this Court ruled that a State may not discriminate\non the basis of race when exercising peremptory challenges against\nprospective jurors in a criminal trial. In 1996, Curtis Flowers allegedly murdered four\npeople in Winona, Mississippi. Flowers is black. He has been tried\nsix separate times before a jury for murder. The same lead\nprosecutor represented the State in all six trials. In the initial three trials, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed each\nconviction. In the first trial, Flowers was convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to “numerous\ninstances of prosecutorial misconduct.” Flowers v. State , 773 So. 2d 309, 327 (2000). In the second trial, the\ntrial court found that the prosecutor discriminated on the basis of\nrace in the peremptory challenge of a black juror. The trial court\nseated the black juror. Flowers was then convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court again reversed the conviction because of\nprosecutorial misconduct at trial. In the third trial, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court yet again reversed the\nconviction, this time because the court concluded that the\nprosecutor had again discriminated against black prospective jurors\nin the jury selection process. The court’s lead opinion stated:\n“The instant case presents us with as strong a prima facie case of\nracial discrimination as we have ever seen in the context of a Batson challenge.” Flowers v. State , 947 So.\n2d 910, 935 (2007). The opinion further stated that the “State\nengaged in racially discriminatory practices during the jury\nselection process” and that the “case evinces an effort by the\nState to exclude African-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. The fourth and fifth trials of Flowers ended in\nmistrials due to hung juries. In his sixth trial, which is the one at issue\nhere, Flowers was convicted. The State struck five of the six black\nprospective jurors. On appeal, Flowers argued that the State again\nviolated Batson in exercising peremptory strikes against\nblack prospective jurors. In a divided 5-to-4 decision, the\nMississippi Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. We granted\ncertiorari on the Batson question and now reverse. See 586\nU. S. ___ (2018). Four critical facts, taken together, require\nreversal. First , in the six trials combined, the State\nemployed its peremptory challenges to strike 41 of the 42 black\nprospective jurors that it could have struck—a statistic that the\nState acknowledged at oral argument in this Court. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n32. Second , in the most recent trial, the sixth trial, the\nState exercised peremptory strikes against five of the six black\nprospective jurors. Third , at the sixth trial, in an\napparent effort to find pretextual reasons to strike black\nprospective jurors, the State engaged in dramatically disparate\nquestioning of black and white prospective jurors. Fourth ,\nthe State then struck at least one black prospective juror, Carolyn\nWright, who was similarly situated to white prospective jurors who\nwere not struck by the State. We need not and do not decide that any one of\nthose four facts alone would require reversal. All that we need to\ndecide, and all that we do decide, is that all of the relevant\nfacts and circumstances taken together establish that the trial\ncourt committed clear error in concluding that the State’s\nperemptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not\n“motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.” Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016)\n(slip op., at 23) (internal quotation marks omitted). In reaching\nthat conclusion, we break no new legal ground. We simply enforce\nand reinforce Batson by applying it to the extraordinary\nfacts of this case. We reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of\nMississippi, and we remand the case for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion. I The underlying events that gave rise to this\ncase took place in Winona, Mississippi. Winona is a small town in\nnorthern Mississippi, just off I–55 almost halfway between Jackson\nand Memphis. The total population of Winona is about 5,000. The\ntown is about 53 percent black and about 46 percent white. In 1996, Bertha Tardy, Robert Golden, Derrick\nStewart, and Carmen Rigby were murdered at the Tardy Furniture\nstore in Winona. All four victims worked at the Tardy Furniture\nstore. Three of the four victims were white; one was black. In\n1997, the State charged Curtis Flowers with murder. Flowers is\nblack. Since then, Flowers has been tried six separate times for\nthe murders. In each of the first two trials, Flowers was tried for\none individual murder. In each subsequent trial, Flowers was tried\nfor all four of the murders together. The same state prosecutor\ntried Flowers each time. The prosecutor is white. At Flowers’ first trial, 36 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 31 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nThe State exercised a total of 12 peremptory strikes, and it used 5\nof them to strike the five qualified black prospective jurors.\nFlowers objected, arguing under Batson that the State had\nexercised its peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory\nmanner. The trial court rejected the Batson challenge.\nBecause the trial court allowed the State’s peremptory strikes,\nFlowers was tried in front of an all-white jury. The jury convicted\nFlowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court\nreversed the conviction, concluding that the State had committed\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, expressing baseless grounds for doubting the credibility of\nwitnesses and mentioning facts that had not been allowed into\nevidence by the trial judge. Flowers , 773 So. 2d, at\n317, 334. In its opinion, the Mississippi Supreme Court described\n“numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct” at the trial. Id., at 327. Because the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed\nbased on prosecutorial misconduct at trial, the court did not reach\nFlowers’ Batson argument. See Flowers , 773\nSo. 2d, at 327 . At the second trial, 30 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 25 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nAs in Flowers’ first trial, the State again used its strikes\nagainst all five black prospective jurors. But this time, the trial\ncourt determined that the State’s asserted reason for one of the\nstrikes was a pretext for discrimination. Specifically, the trial\ncourt determined that one of the State’s proffered reasons—that the\njuror had been inattentive and was nodding off during jury\nselection—for striking that juror was false, and the trial court\ntherefore sustained Flowers’ Batson challenge. The trial\ncourt disallowed the strike and sat that black juror on the jury.\nThe jury at Flowers’ second trial consisted of 11 white jurors and\n1 black juror. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to\ndeath. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court again\nreversed. The court ruled that the prosecutor had again engaged in\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, impermissibly referencing evidence and attempting to\nundermine witness credibility without a factual basis. See Flowers v. State , 842 So. 2d 531, 538, 553\n(2003). At Flowers’ third trial, 45 prospective\njurors—17 black and 28 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. One of the black prospective jurors was struck for cause,\nleaving 16. The State exercised a total of 15 peremptory strikes,\nand it used all 15 against black prospective jurors. Flowers again\nargued that the State had used its peremptory strikes in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner. The trial court found that the State had not\ndiscriminated on the basis of race. See Flowers , 947\nSo. 2d, at 916. The jury in Flowers’ third trial consisted of\n11 white jurors and 1 black juror. The lone black juror who served\non the jury was seated after the State ran out of peremptory\nstrikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court yet\nagain reversed, concluding that the State had again violated Batson by discriminating on the basis of race in exercising\nall 15 of its peremptory strikes against 15 black prospective\njurors. See Flowers , 947 So. 2d, at 939. The court’s\nlead opinion stated: “The instant case presents us with as strong a\nprima facie case of racial discrimination as we have ever seen in\nthe context of a Batson challenge.” Id., at 935. The\nopinion explained that although “each individual strike may have\njustifiably appeared to the trial court to be sufficiently race\nneutral, the trial court also has a duty to look at the State’s use\nof peremptory challenges in toto .” Id., at 937.\nThe opinion emphasized that “trial judges should not blindly accept\nany and every reason put forth by the State, especially” when “the\nState continues to exercise challenge after challenge only upon\nmembers of a particular race.” Ibid . The opinion added that\nthe “State engaged in racially discriminatory practices” and that\nthe “case evinces an effort by the State to exclude\nAfrican-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. At Flowers’ fourth trial, 36 prospective\njurors—16 black and 20 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. The State exercised a total of 11 peremptory strikes, and\nit used all 11 against black prospective jurors. But because of the\nrelatively large number of prospective jurors who were black, the\nState did not have enough peremptory challenges to eliminate all of\nthe black prospective jurors. The seated jury consisted of seven\nwhite jurors and five black jurors. That jury could not reach a\nverdict, and the proceeding ended in a mistrial. As to the fifth trial, there is no available\nracial information about the prospective jurors, as distinct from\nthe jurors who ultimately sat on the jury. The jury was composed of\nnine white jurors and three black jurors. The jury could not reach\na verdict, and the trial again ended in a mistrial. At the sixth trial, which we consider here, 26\nprospective jurors—6 black and 20 white—were presented to\npotentially serve on the jury. The State exercised a total of six\nperemptory strikes, and it used five of the six against black\nprospective jurors, leaving one black juror to sit on the jury.\nFlowers again argued that the State had exercised its peremptory\nstrikes in a racially discrimina-tory manner. The trial court\nconcluded that the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each\nof the five peremp-tory strikes against the five black prospective\njurors. The jury at Flowers’ sixth trial consisted of 11 white\njurors and 1 black juror. That jury convicted Flowers of murder and\nsentenced him to death. In a divided decision, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt agreed with the trial court on the Batson issue and\nstated that the State’s “race-neutral reasons were valid and not\nmerely pretextual.” Flowers v. State , 158 So. 3d\n1009, 1058 (2014). Flowers then sought review in this Court. This\nCourt granted Flowers’ petition for a writ of certio-rari, vacated\nthe judgment of the Mississippi Supreme Court, and remanded for\nfurther consideration in light of the decision in Foster ,\n578 U. S. ___. Flowers v. Mississippi , 579\nU. S. ___ (2016). In Foster , this Court held that the\ndefendant Foster had established a Batson violation. 578\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 25). On remand, the Mississippi Supreme Court by a\n5-to-4 vote again upheld Flowers’ conviction. See 240 So. 3d 1082\n(2017). Justice King wrote a dissent for three justices. He stated:\n“I cannot conclude that Flowers received a fair trial, nor can I\nconclude that prospective jurors were not subjected to\nimpermissible discrimination.” Id ., at 1172. According to\nJustice King, both the trial court and the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt “completely disregard[ed] the constitutional right of\nprospective jurors to be free from a racially discriminatory\nselection process.” Id., at 1171. We granted certiorari. See\n586 U. S. ___. II A Other than voting, serving on a jury is the\nmost substantial opportunity that most citizens have to participate\nin the democratic process. See Powers v. Ohio , 499 U.S.\n400 , 407 (1991). Jury selection in criminal cases varies\nsignificantly based on state and local rules and practices, but\nordinarily consists of three phases, which we describe here in\ngeneral terms. First , a group of citizens in the community\nis randomly summoned to the courthouse on a particular day for\npotential jury service. Second , a subgroup of those\nprospective jurors is called into a particular courtroom for a\nspecific case. The prospective jurors are often questioned by the\njudge, as well as by the prosecutor and defense attorney. During\nthat second phase, the judge may excuse certain prospective jurors\nbased on their answers. Third , the prosecutor and defense\nattorney may challenge certain prospective jurors. The attorneys\nmay challenge prospective jurors for cause, which usually stems\nfrom a potential juror’s conflicts of interest or inability to be\nimpartial. In addition to challenges for cause, each side is\ntypically afforded a set number of peremptory challenges or\nstrikes. Peremptory strikes have very old credentials and can be\ntraced back to the common law. Those peremptory strikes\ntraditionally may be used to remove any potential juror for any\nreason—no questions asked. That blanket discretion to peremptorily strike\nprospective jurors for any reason can clash with the dictates of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. This case arises at the intersection of\nthe peremptory challenge and the Equal Protection Clause. And to\nunderstand how equal protection law applies to peremptory\nchallenges, it helps to begin at the beginning. Ratified in 1868 in the wake of the Civil War,\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides\nthat no State shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\nequal protection of the laws.” A primary objective of the Equal\nProtection Clause, this Court stated just five years after\nratification, was “the freedom of the slave race, the security and\nfirm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the\nnewly-made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who\nhad formerly exercised unlimited dominion over him.” Slaughter-House Cases , 16 Wall. 36, 71 (1873). In 1875, to help enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Congress passed and President Ulysses S. Grant signed\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1875. Ch. 114, 18Stat. 335. Among other\nthings, that law made it a criminal offense for state officials to\nexclude individuals from jury service on account of their race. 18\nU. S. C. §243. The Act provides: “No citizen possessing\nall other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by law\nshall be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any\ncourt of the United States, or of any State on account of race,\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.” In 1880, just 12 years after ratification of the\nFourteenth Amendment, the Court decided Strauder v. West\nVirginia , 100 U.S.\n303 . That case concerned a West Virginia statute that allowed\nwhites only to serve as jurors. The Court held the law\nunconstitutional. In reaching its conclusion, the Court explained\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment required “that the law in the States\nshall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons,\nwhether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the\nStates, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose protection\nthe amendment was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall\nbe made against them by law because of their color.” Id., at\n307. In the words of the Strauder Court: “The very fact that\ncolored people are singled out and expressly denied by a statute\nall right to participate in the administration of the law, as\njurors, because of their color, though they are citizens, and may\nbe in other respects fully qualified, is practically a brand upon\nthem, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority, and a\nstimulant to that race prejudice which is an impediment to securing\nto individuals of the race that equal justice which the law aims to\nsecure to all others.” Id ., at 308. For those reasons, the\nCourt ruled that the West Virginia statute exclud- ing blacks from\njury service violated the Fourteenth Amendment. As the Court later explained in Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U.S.\n483 (1954), the Court’s decisions in the Slaughter-House\nCases and Strauder interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment\n“as proscribing all state-imposed discriminations against the Negro\nrace,” including in jury service. Brown , 347 U. S., at\n490. In the decades after Strauder , the Court\nreiterated that States may not discriminate on the basis of race in\njury selection. See, e.g., Neal v. Delaware , 103 U.S.\n370 , 397 (1881); Carter v. Texas , 177 U.S.\n442 , 447 (1900); Norris v. Alabama , 294 U.S.\n587 , 597–599 (1935); Hale v. Kentucky , 303 U.S.\n613 , 616 (1938) ( per curiam ); Pierre v. Louisiana , 306 U.S.\n354 , 362 (1939); Smith v. Texas , 311 U.S.\n128 , 130–131 (1940); Avery v. Georgia , 345 U.S.\n559 , 562 (1953); Hernandez v. Texas , 347 U.S.\n475 , 477–478, 482 (1954); Coleman v. Alabama , 377 U.S.\n129 , 133 (1964). But critical problems persisted. Even though\nlaws barring blacks from serving on juries were unconstitutional\nafter Strauder , many jurisdictions employed various\ndiscriminatory tools to prevent black persons from being called for\njury service. And when those tactics failed, or were invalidated,\nprosecutors could still exercise peremptory strikes in individual\ncases to remove most or all black prospective jurors. In the century after Strauder , the\nfreedom to exercise peremptory strikes for any reason meant that\n“the problem of racial exclusion from jury service” remained\n“widespread” and “deeply entrenched.” 5 U. S. Commission on\nCivil Rights Report 90 (1961). Simple math shows how that happened.\nGiven that blacks were a minority of the population, in many\njurisdictions the number of peremp-tory strikes available to the\nprosecutor exceeded the number of black prospective jurors. So\nprosecutors could routinely exercise peremptories to strike all the\nblack prospective jurors and thereby ensure all-white juries. The\nexclusion of black prospective jurors was almost total in certain\njurisdictions, especially in cases involving black defendants.\nSimilarly, defense counsel could use—and routinely did\nuse—peremptory challenges to strike all the black prospective\njurors in cases involving white defendants and black victims. In the aftermath of Strauder , the\nexclusion of black jurors became more covert and less overt—often\naccomplished through peremptory challenges in individual courtrooms\nrather than by blanket operation of law. But as this Court later\nnoted, the results were the same for black jurors and black\ndefendants, as well as for the black community’s confidence in the\nfairness of the American criminal justice system. See Batson , 476 U. S., at 98–99. Eighty-five years after Strauder , the\nCourt decided Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S.\n202 (1965). The defendant Swain was black. Swain was convicted\nof a capital offense in Talladega County, Alabama, and sentenced to\ndeath. Swain presented evidence that no black juror had served on a\njury in Talladega County in more than a decade. See id . , at 226. And in Swain’s case, the prosecutor\nstruck all six qualified black prospective jurors, ensuring that\nSwain was tried before an all-white jury. Swain invoked Strauder to argue that the prosecutor in his case had\nimpermis-sibly discriminated on the basis of race by using\nperemptory challenges to strike the six black prospective jurors.\nSee 380 U. S., at 203, 210. This Court ruled that Swain had not established\nunconstitutional discrimination. Most importantly, the Court held\nthat a defendant could not object to the State’s use of peremptory\nstrikes in an individual case. In the Court’s words: “[W]e cannot\nhold that the striking of Negroes in a particular case is a denial\nof equal protection of the laws.” Id., at 221. The Swain Court reasoned that prosecutors do not always judge\nprospective jurors individually when exercising peremptory strikes.\nInstead, prosecutors choose which prospective jurors to strike “in\nlight of the limited knowledge counsel has of them, which may\ninclude their group affiliations, in the context of the case to be\ntried.” Ibid . In the Court’s view, the prosecutor could\nstrike prospective jurors on the basis of their group affiliations,\nincluding race. In other words, a prosecutor could permissibly\nstrike a prospective juror for any reason, including the assumption\nor belief that a black prospective juror, because of race, would be\nfavorable to a black defendant or unfavorable to the State. See id., at 220–221. To be sure, the Swain Court held that a\ndefendant could make out a case of racial discrimination by showing\nthat the State “in case after case, whatever the circumstances,\nwhatever the crime and whoever the defendant or the victim may be,”\nhad been responsible for the removal of qualified black prospective\njurors so that no black jurors “ever serve on petit juries.” Id., at 223. But Swain ’s high bar for establishing a\nconstitutional violation was almost impossible for any defendant to\nsurmount, as the aftermath of Swain amply\ndemonstrated . Twenty-one years later, in its 1986 decision in Batson , the Court revisited several critical aspects of Swain and in essence overruled them. In so doing, the Batson Court emphasized that “the central concern” of the\nFourteenth Amendment “was to put an end to governmental\ndiscrimination on account of race.” 476 U. S., at 85. The Batson Court noted that Swain had left prosecutors’\nperemptory challenges “largely immune from constitutional\nscrutiny.” 476 U. S., at 92–93. In his concurrence in Batson , Justice Byron White (the author of Swain )\nagreed that Swain should be overruled. He stated: “[T]he\npractice of peremptorily eliminating blacks from petit juries in\ncases with black defendants remains widespread, so much so” that “I\nagree with the Court that the time has come to rule as it has.” 476\nU. S., at 101–102. Under Batson , once a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination has been shown by a defendant, the State must\nprovide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes. The trial\njudge must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated reasons were\nthe actual reasons or instead were a pretext for discrimination. Id., at 97–98. Four parts of Batson warrant particular\nemphasis here. First , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s insistence that a defendant demonstrate a history of\nracially discriminatory strikes in order to make out a claim of\nrace discrimination. See 476 U. S., at 95. According to the Batson Court, defendants had run into “practical\ndifficulties” in trying to prove that a State had systematically\n“exercised peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury on\naccount of race.” Id ., at 92, n. 17. The Batson Court\nexplained that, in some jurisdictions, requiring a defendant to\n“investigate, over a number of cases, the race of persons tried in\nthe particular jurisdiction, the racial composition of the venire\nand petit jury, and the manner in which both parties exercised\ntheir peremptory challenges” posed an “insurmountable” burden. Ibid . In addition to that practical point, the Court\nstressed a basic equal protection point: In the eyes of the\nConstitution, one racially discriminatory peremptory strike is one\ntoo many. For those reasons, the Batson Court held\nthat a criminal defendant could show “purposeful discrimination in\nselection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the\nprosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges at the\ndefendant’s trial .” Id ., at 96 (emphasis added). Second , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s statement that a prosecutor could strike a black\njuror based on an assumption or belief that the black juror would\nfavor a black defendant. In some of the most critical sentences in\nthe Batson opinion, the Court emphasized that a prosecutor\nmay not rebut a claim of discrimination “by stating merely that he\nchallenged jurors of the defendant’s race on the assumption—or his\nintuitive judgment—that they would be partial to the defendant\nbecause of their shared race.” 476 U. S., at 97. The Court\nelaborated: The Equal Protection Clause “forbids the States to\nstrike black veniremen on the assumption that they will be biased\nin a particular case simply because the defendant is black. The\ncore guarantee of equal protection, ensuring citizens that their\nState will not discriminate on account of race, would be\nmeaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors on the basis\nof such assumptions, which arise solely from the jurors’ race.” Id., at 97–98. In his concurrence, Justice Thurgood Marshall\ndrove the point home: “Exclusion of blacks from a jury, solely\nbecause of race, can no more be justified",

Mississippi certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi No. 17–9572. Argued March 20, 2019—Decided\nJune 21, 2019 Petitioner Curtis Flowers has been tried six\nseparate times for the murder of four employees of a Mississippi\nfurniture store. Flowers is black; three of the four victims were\nwhite. At the first two trials, the State used its peremptory\nstrikes on all of the qualified black prospective jurors. In each\ncase, the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death, but\nthe convictions were later reversed by the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt based on prosecutorial misconduct. At the third trial, the\nState used all of its 15 peremptory strikes against black\nprospective jurors, and the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed again, this\ntime concluding that the State exercised its peremptory strikes on\nthe basis of race in violation of Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 . Flowers’ fourth and fifth trials ended in mistrials. At the\nfourth, the State exercised 11 peremptory strikes—all against black\nprospective jurors. No available racial information exists about\nthe prospective jurors in the fifth trial. At the sixth trial, the\nState exercised six peremptory strikes—five against black\nprospective jurors, allowing one black juror to be seated. Flowers\nagain raised a Batson claim, but the trial court concluded\nthat the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each of the\nfive peremptory strikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed. After this\nCourt vacated that judgment and remanded in light of Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt again upheld Flowers’ conviction in a divided 5-to-4\ndecision. Justice King dissented on the Batson issue and was\njoined by two other Justices. Held : All of the relevant facts\nand circumstances taken together establish that the trial court at\nFlowers’ sixth trial committed clear error in concluding that the\nState’s peremptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright\nwas not motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.\nPp. 7–31. (a) Under Batson , once a prima\nfacie case of discrimination has been shown by a defendant, the\nState must provide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes.\nThe trial judge then must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated\nreasons were the actual reasons or instead were a pretext for\ndiscrimination. The Batson Court rejected four arguments.\nFirst, the Batson Court rejected the idea that a defendant\nmust demonstrate a history of racially discriminatory strikes in\norder to make out a claim of race discrimination. Second, the Batson Court rejected the argument that a prosecutor could\nstrike a black juror based on an assumption or belief that the\nblack juror would favor a black defendant. Third, the Batson Court rejected the argument that race-based peremptories should be\npermissible because black, white, Asian, and Hispanic defendants\nand jurors were all “equally” subject to race-based discrimination.\nFourth, the Batson Court rejected the argument that\nrace-based peremptories are permissible because both the\nprosecution and defense could employ them in any individual case\nand in essence balance things out. Pp. 7–15. (b) Four categories of evidence loom\nlarge in assessing the Batson issue here, where the State\nhad a persistent pattern of striking black prospective jurors from\nFlowers’ first through his sixth trial. Pp. 15–30. (1) A review of the history of the\nState’s peremptory strikes in Flowers’ first four trials strongly\nsupports the conclusion that the State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial was motivated in substantial part by\ndiscriminatory intent. The State tried to strike all 36 black\nprospective jurors over the course of the first four trials. And\nthe state courts themselves concluded that the State had violated Batson on two separate occasions . The State’s\nrelentless, determined effort to rid the jury of black individuals\nstrongly suggests that the State wanted to try Flowers before a\njury with as few black jurors as possible, and ideally before an\nall-white jury. Pp. 19–22. (2) The State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial followed the same pattern as the first four\ntrials. Pp. 22–23. (3) Disparate questioning can be\nprobative of discriminatory intent. Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U.S.\n322 , 331–332, 344–345. Here, the State spent far more time\nquestioning the black prospective jurors than the accepted white\njurors—145 questions asked of 5 black prospective jurors and 12\nquestions asked of 11 white seated jurors. The record refutes the\nState’s explanation that it questioned black and white prospective\njurors differently only because of differences in the jurors’\ncharacteristics. Along with the historical evidence from the\nearlier trials, as well as the State’s striking of five of six\nblack prospective jurors at the sixth trial, the dramatically\ndisparate questioning and investigation of black prospective jurors\nand white prospective jurors at the sixth trial strongly suggest\nthat the State was motivated in substantial part by a\ndiscriminatory intent. Pp. 23–26. (4) Comparing prospective jurors who were\nstruck and not struck can be an important step in determining\nwhether a Batson violation occurred. See Snyder v. Louisiana , 552 U.S.\n472 , 483–484. Here, Carolyn Wright, a black prospective juror,\nwas struck, the State says, in part because she knew several\ndefense witnesses and had worked at Wal-Mart where Flowers’ father\nalso worked. But three white prospective jurors also knew many\nindividuals involved in the case, and the State asked them no\nindividual questions about their connections to witnesses. White\nprospective jurors also had relationships with members of Flowers’\nfamily, but the State did not ask them follow-up questions in order\nto explore the depth of those relationships. The State also\nincorrectly explained that it exercised a peremptory strike against\nWright because she had worked with one of Flowers’ sisters and made\napparently incorrect statements to justify the strikes of other\nblack prospective jurors. When considered with other evidence, a\nseries of factually inaccurate explanations for striking black\nprospective jurors can be another clue showing discriminatory\nintent. The overall context here requires skepticism of the State’s\nstrike of Carolyn Wright. The trial court at Flowers’ sixth trial\ncommitted clear error in concluding that the State’s peremptory\nstrike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not motivated\nin substantial part by discriminatory intent. Pp. 26–30. 240 So. 3d 1082, reversed and remanded. Kavanaugh, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 17–9572 _________________ CURTIS GIOVANNI FLOWERS, PETITIONER v. MISSISSIPPI on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi [June 21, 2019] Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. In Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 (1986), this Court ruled that a State may not discriminate\non the basis of race when exercising peremptory challenges against\nprospective jurors in a criminal trial. In 1996, Curtis Flowers allegedly murdered four\npeople in Winona, Mississippi. Flowers is black. He has been tried\nsix separate times before a jury for murder. The same lead\nprosecutor represented the State in all six trials. In the initial three trials, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed each\nconviction. In the first trial, Flowers was convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to “numerous\ninstances of prosecutorial misconduct.” Flowers v. State , 773 So. 2d 309, 327 (2000). In the second trial, the\ntrial court found that the prosecutor discriminated on the basis of\nrace in the peremptory challenge of a black juror. The trial court\nseated the black juror. Flowers was then convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court again reversed the conviction because of\nprosecutorial misconduct at trial. In the third trial, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court yet again reversed the\nconviction, this time because the court concluded that the\nprosecutor had again discriminated against black prospective jurors\nin the jury selection process. The court’s lead opinion stated:\n“The instant case presents us with as strong a prima facie case of\nracial discrimination as we have ever seen in the context of a Batson challenge.” Flowers v. State , 947 So.\n2d 910, 935 (2007). The opinion further stated that the “State\nengaged in racially discriminatory practices during the jury\nselection process” and that the “case evinces an effort by the\nState to exclude African-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. The fourth and fifth trials of Flowers ended in\nmistrials due to hung juries. In his sixth trial, which is the one at issue\nhere, Flowers was convicted. The State struck five of the six black\nprospective jurors. On appeal, Flowers argued that the State again\nviolated Batson in exercising peremptory strikes against\nblack prospective jurors. In a divided 5-to-4 decision, the\nMississippi Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. We granted\ncertiorari on the Batson question and now reverse. See 586\nU. S. ___ (2018). Four critical facts, taken together, require\nreversal. First , in the six trials combined, the State\nemployed its peremptory challenges to strike 41 of the 42 black\nprospective jurors that it could have struck—a statistic that the\nState acknowledged at oral argument in this Court. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n32. Second , in the most recent trial, the sixth trial, the\nState exercised peremptory strikes against five of the six black\nprospective jurors. Third , at the sixth trial, in an\napparent effort to find pretextual reasons to strike black\nprospective jurors, the State engaged in dramatically disparate\nquestioning of black and white prospective jurors. Fourth ,\nthe State then struck at least one black prospective juror, Carolyn\nWright, who was similarly situated to white prospective jurors who\nwere not struck by the State. We need not and do not decide that any one of\nthose four facts alone would require reversal. All that we need to\ndecide, and all that we do decide, is that all of the relevant\nfacts and circumstances taken together establish that the trial\ncourt committed clear error in concluding that the State’s\nperemptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not\n“motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.” Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016)\n(slip op., at 23) (internal quotation marks omitted). In reaching\nthat conclusion, we break no new legal ground. We simply enforce\nand reinforce Batson by applying it to the extraordinary\nfacts of this case. We reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of\nMississippi, and we remand the case for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion. I The underlying events that gave rise to this\ncase took place in Winona, Mississippi. Winona is a small town in\nnorthern Mississippi, just off I–55 almost halfway between Jackson\nand Memphis. The total population of Winona is about 5,000. The\ntown is about 53 percent black and about 46 percent white. In 1996, Bertha Tardy, Robert Golden, Derrick\nStewart, and Carmen Rigby were murdered at the Tardy Furniture\nstore in Winona. All four victims worked at the Tardy Furniture\nstore. Three of the four victims were white; one was black. In\n1997, the State charged Curtis Flowers with murder. Flowers is\nblack. Since then, Flowers has been tried six separate times for\nthe murders. In each of the first two trials, Flowers was tried for\none individual murder. In each subsequent trial, Flowers was tried\nfor all four of the murders together. The same state prosecutor\ntried Flowers each time. The prosecutor is white. At Flowers’ first trial, 36 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 31 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nThe State exercised a total of 12 peremptory strikes, and it used 5\nof them to strike the five qualified black prospective jurors.\nFlowers objected, arguing under Batson that the State had\nexercised its peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory\nmanner. The trial court rejected the Batson challenge.\nBecause the trial court allowed the State’s peremptory strikes,\nFlowers was tried in front of an all-white jury. The jury convicted\nFlowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court\nreversed the conviction, concluding that the State had committed\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, expressing baseless grounds for doubting the credibility of\nwitnesses and mentioning facts that had not been allowed into\nevidence by the trial judge. Flowers , 773 So. 2d, at\n317, 334. In its opinion, the Mississippi Supreme Court described\n“numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct” at the trial. Id., at 327. Because the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed\nbased on prosecutorial misconduct at trial, the court did not reach\nFlowers’ Batson argument. See Flowers , 773\nSo. 2d, at 327 . At the second trial, 30 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 25 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nAs in Flowers’ first trial, the State again used its strikes\nagainst all five black prospective jurors. But this time, the trial\ncourt determined that the State’s asserted reason for one of the\nstrikes was a pretext for discrimination. Specifically, the trial\ncourt determined that one of the State’s proffered reasons—that the\njuror had been inattentive and was nodding off during jury\nselection—for striking that juror was false, and the trial court\ntherefore sustained Flowers’ Batson challenge. The trial\ncourt disallowed the strike and sat that black juror on the jury.\nThe jury at Flowers’ second trial consisted of 11 white jurors and\n1 black juror. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to\ndeath. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court again\nreversed. The court ruled that the prosecutor had again engaged in\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, impermissibly referencing evidence and attempting to\nundermine witness credibility without a factual basis. See Flowers v. State , 842 So. 2d 531, 538, 553\n(2003). At Flowers’ third trial, 45 prospective\njurors—17 black and 28 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. One of the black prospective jurors was struck for cause,\nleaving 16. The State exercised a total of 15 peremptory strikes,\nand it used all 15 against black prospective jurors. Flowers again\nargued that the State had used its peremptory strikes in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner. The trial court found that the State had not\ndiscriminated on the basis of race. See Flowers , 947\nSo. 2d, at 916. The jury in Flowers’ third trial consisted of\n11 white jurors and 1 black juror. The lone black juror who served\non the jury was seated after the State ran out of peremptory\nstrikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court yet\nagain reversed, concluding that the State had again violated Batson by discriminating on the basis of race in exercising\nall 15 of its peremptory strikes against 15 black prospective\njurors. See Flowers , 947 So. 2d, at 939. The court’s\nlead opinion stated: “The instant case presents us with as strong a\nprima facie case of racial discrimination as we have ever seen in\nthe context of a Batson challenge.” Id., at 935. The\nopinion explained that although “each individual strike may have\njustifiably appeared to the trial court to be sufficiently race\nneutral, the trial court also has a duty to look at the State’s use\nof peremptory challenges in toto .” Id., at 937.\nThe opinion emphasized that “trial judges should not blindly accept\nany and every reason put forth by the State, especially” when “the\nState continues to exercise challenge after challenge only upon\nmembers of a particular race.” Ibid . The opinion added that\nthe “State engaged in racially discriminatory practices” and that\nthe “case evinces an effort by the State to exclude\nAfrican-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. At Flowers’ fourth trial, 36 prospective\njurors—16 black and 20 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. The State exercised a total of 11 peremptory strikes, and\nit used all 11 against black prospective jurors. But because of the\nrelatively large number of prospective jurors who were black, the\nState did not have enough peremptory challenges to eliminate all of\nthe black prospective jurors. The seated jury consisted of seven\nwhite jurors and five black jurors. That jury could not reach a\nverdict, and the proceeding ended in a mistrial. As to the fifth trial, there is no available\nracial information about the prospective jurors, as distinct from\nthe jurors who ultimately sat on the jury. The jury was composed of\nnine white jurors and three black jurors. The jury could not reach\na verdict, and the trial again ended in a mistrial. At the sixth trial, which we consider here, 26\nprospective jurors—6 black and 20 white—were presented to\npotentially serve on the jury. The State exercised a total of six\nperemptory strikes, and it used five of the six against black\nprospective jurors, leaving one black juror to sit on the jury.\nFlowers again argued that the State had exercised its peremptory\nstrikes in a racially discrimina-tory manner. The trial court\nconcluded that the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each\nof the five peremp-tory strikes against the five black prospective\njurors. The jury at Flowers’ sixth trial consisted of 11 white\njurors and 1 black juror. That jury convicted Flowers of murder and\nsentenced him to death. In a divided decision, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt agreed with the trial court on the Batson issue and\nstated that the State’s “race-neutral reasons were valid and not\nmerely pretextual.” Flowers v. State , 158 So. 3d\n1009, 1058 (2014). Flowers then sought review in this Court. This\nCourt granted Flowers’ petition for a writ of certio-rari, vacated\nthe judgment of the Mississippi Supreme Court, and remanded for\nfurther consideration in light of the decision in Foster ,\n578 U. S. ___. Flowers v. Mississippi , 579\nU. S. ___ (2016). In Foster , this Court held that the\ndefendant Foster had established a Batson violation. 578\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 25). On remand, the Mississippi Supreme Court by a\n5-to-4 vote again upheld Flowers’ conviction. See 240 So. 3d 1082\n(2017). Justice King wrote a dissent for three justices. He stated:\n“I cannot conclude that Flowers received a fair trial, nor can I\nconclude that prospective jurors were not subjected to\nimpermissible discrimination.” Id ., at 1172. According to\nJustice King, both the trial court and the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt “completely disregard[ed] the constitutional right of\nprospective jurors to be free from a racially discriminatory\nselection process.” Id., at 1171. We granted certiorari. See\n586 U. S. ___. II A Other than voting, serving on a jury is the\nmost substantial opportunity that most citizens have to participate\nin the democratic process. See Powers v. Ohio , 499 U.S.\n400 , 407 (1991). Jury selection in criminal cases varies\nsignificantly based on state and local rules and practices, but\nordinarily consists of three phases, which we describe here in\ngeneral terms. First , a group of citizens in the community\nis randomly summoned to the courthouse on a particular day for\npotential jury service. Second , a subgroup of those\nprospective jurors is called into a particular courtroom for a\nspecific case. The prospective jurors are often questioned by the\njudge, as well as by the prosecutor and defense attorney. During\nthat second phase, the judge may excuse certain prospective jurors\nbased on their answers. Third , the prosecutor and defense\nattorney may challenge certain prospective jurors. The attorneys\nmay challenge prospective jurors for cause, which usually stems\nfrom a potential juror’s conflicts of interest or inability to be\nimpartial. In addition to challenges for cause, each side is\ntypically afforded a set number of peremptory challenges or\nstrikes. Peremptory strikes have very old credentials and can be\ntraced back to the common law. Those peremptory strikes\ntraditionally may be used to remove any potential juror for any\nreason—no questions asked. That blanket discretion to peremptorily strike\nprospective jurors for any reason can clash with the dictates of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. This case arises at the intersection of\nthe peremptory challenge and the Equal Protection Clause. And to\nunderstand how equal protection law applies to peremptory\nchallenges, it helps to begin at the beginning. Ratified in 1868 in the wake of the Civil War,\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides\nthat no State shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\nequal protection of the laws.” A primary objective of the Equal\nProtection Clause, this Court stated just five years after\nratification, was “the freedom of the slave race, the security and\nfirm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the\nnewly-made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who\nhad formerly exercised unlimited dominion over him.” Slaughter-House Cases , 16 Wall. 36, 71 (1873). In 1875, to help enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Congress passed and President Ulysses S. Grant signed\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1875. Ch. 114, 18Stat. 335. Among other\nthings, that law made it a criminal offense for state officials to\nexclude individuals from jury service on account of their race. 18\nU. S. C. §243. The Act provides: “No citizen possessing\nall other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by law\nshall be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any\ncourt of the United States, or of any State on account of race,\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.” In 1880, just 12 years after ratification of the\nFourteenth Amendment, the Court decided Strauder v. West\nVirginia , 100 U.S.\n303 . That case concerned a West Virginia statute that allowed\nwhites only to serve as jurors. The Court held the law\nunconstitutional. In reaching its conclusion, the Court explained\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment required “that the law in the States\nshall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons,\nwhether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the\nStates, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose protection\nthe amendment was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall\nbe made against them by law because of their color.” Id., at\n307. In the words of the Strauder Court: “The very fact that\ncolored people are singled out and expressly denied by a statute\nall right to participate in the administration of the law, as\njurors, because of their color, though they are citizens, and may\nbe in other respects fully qualified, is practically a brand upon\nthem, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority, and a\nstimulant to that race prejudice which is an impediment to securing\nto individuals of the race that equal justice which the law aims to\nsecure to all others.” Id ., at 308. For those reasons, the\nCourt ruled that the West Virginia statute exclud- ing blacks from\njury service violated the Fourteenth Amendment. As the Court later explained in Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U.S.\n483 (1954), the Court’s decisions in the Slaughter-House\nCases and Strauder interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment\n“as proscribing all state-imposed discriminations against the Negro\nrace,” including in jury service. Brown , 347 U. S., at\n490. In the decades after Strauder , the Court\nreiterated that States may not discriminate on the basis of race in\njury selection. See, e.g., Neal v. Delaware , 103 U.S.\n370 , 397 (1881); Carter v. Texas , 177 U.S.\n442 , 447 (1900); Norris v. Alabama , 294 U.S.\n587 , 597–599 (1935); Hale v. Kentucky , 303 U.S.\n613 , 616 (1938) ( per curiam ); Pierre v. Louisiana , 306 U.S.\n354 , 362 (1939); Smith v. Texas , 311 U.S.\n128 , 130–131 (1940); Avery v. Georgia , 345 U.S.\n559 , 562 (1953); Hernandez v. Texas , 347 U.S.\n475 , 477–478, 482 (1954); Coleman v. Alabama , 377 U.S.\n129 , 133 (1964). But critical problems persisted. Even though\nlaws barring blacks from serving on juries were unconstitutional\nafter Strauder , many jurisdictions employed various\ndiscriminatory tools to prevent black persons from being called for\njury service. And when those tactics failed, or were invalidated,\nprosecutors could still exercise peremptory strikes in individual\ncases to remove most or all black prospective jurors. In the century after Strauder , the\nfreedom to exercise peremptory strikes for any reason meant that\n“the problem of racial exclusion from jury service” remained\n“widespread” and “deeply entrenched.” 5 U. S. Commission on\nCivil Rights Report 90 (1961). Simple math shows how that happened.\nGiven that blacks were a minority of the population, in many\njurisdictions the number of peremp-tory strikes available to the\nprosecutor exceeded the number of black prospective jurors. So\nprosecutors could routinely exercise peremptories to strike all the\nblack prospective jurors and thereby ensure all-white juries. The\nexclusion of black prospective jurors was almost total in certain\njurisdictions, especially in cases involving black defendants.\nSimilarly, defense counsel could use—and routinely did\nuse—peremptory challenges to strike all the black prospective\njurors in cases involving white defendants and black victims. In the aftermath of Strauder , the\nexclusion of black jurors became more covert and less overt—often\naccomplished through peremptory challenges in individual courtrooms\nrather than by blanket operation of law. But as this Court later\nnoted, the results were the same for black jurors and black\ndefendants, as well as for the black community’s confidence in the\nfairness of the American criminal justice system. See Batson , 476 U. S., at 98–99. Eighty-five years after Strauder , the\nCourt decided Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S.\n202 (1965). The defendant Swain was black. Swain was convicted\nof a capital offense in Talladega County, Alabama, and sentenced to\ndeath. Swain presented evidence that no black juror had served on a\njury in Talladega County in more than a decade. See id . , at 226. And in Swain’s case, the prosecutor\nstruck all six qualified black prospective jurors, ensuring that\nSwain was tried before an all-white jury. Swain invoked Strauder to argue that the prosecutor in his case had\nimpermis-sibly discriminated on the basis of race by using\nperemptory challenges to strike the six black prospective jurors.\nSee 380 U. S., at 203, 210. This Court ruled that Swain had not established\nunconstitutional discrimination. Most importantly, the Court held\nthat a defendant could not object to the State’s use of peremptory\nstrikes in an individual case. In the Court’s words: “[W]e cannot\nhold that the striking of Negroes in a particular case is a denial\nof equal protection of the laws.” Id., at 221. The Swain Court reasoned that prosecutors do not always judge\nprospective jurors individually when exercising peremptory strikes.\nInstead, prosecutors choose which prospective jurors to strike “in\nlight of the limited knowledge counsel has of them, which may\ninclude their group affiliations, in the context of the case to be\ntried.” Ibid . In the Court’s view, the prosecutor could\nstrike prospective jurors on the basis of their group affiliations,\nincluding race. In other words, a prosecutor could permissibly\nstrike a prospective juror for any reason, including the assumption\nor belief that a black prospective juror, because of race, would be\nfavorable to a black defendant or unfavorable to the State. See id., at 220–221. To be sure, the Swain Court held that a\ndefendant could make out a case of racial discrimination by showing\nthat the State “in case after case, whatever the circumstances,\nwhatever the crime and whoever the defendant or the victim may be,”\nhad been responsible for the removal of qualified black prospective\njurors so that no black jurors “ever serve on petit juries.” Id., at 223. But Swain ’s high bar for establishing a\nconstitutional violation was almost impossible for any defendant to\nsurmount, as the aftermath of Swain amply\ndemonstrated . Twenty-one years later, in its 1986 decision in Batson , the Court revisited several critical aspects of Swain and in essence overruled them. In so doing, the Batson Court emphasized that “the central concern” of the\nFourteenth Amendment “was to put an end to governmental\ndiscrimination on account of race.” 476 U. S., at 85. The Batson Court noted that Swain had left prosecutors’\nperemptory challenges “largely immune from constitutional\nscrutiny.” 476 U. S., at 92–93. In his concurrence in Batson , Justice Byron White (the author of Swain )\nagreed that Swain should be overruled. He stated: “[T]he\npractice of peremptorily eliminating blacks from petit juries in\ncases with black defendants remains widespread, so much so” that “I\nagree with the Court that the time has come to rule as it has.” 476\nU. S., at 101–102. Under Batson , once a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination has been shown by a defendant, the State must\nprovide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes. The trial\njudge must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated reasons were\nthe actual reasons or instead were a pretext for discrimination. Id., at 97–98. Four parts of Batson warrant particular\nemphasis here. First , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s insistence that a defendant demonstrate a history of\nracially discriminatory strikes in order to make out a claim of\nrace discrimination. See 476 U. S., at 95. According to the Batson Court, defendants had run into “practical\ndifficulties” in trying to prove that a State had systematically\n“exercised peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury on\naccount of race.” Id ., at 92, n. 17. The Batson Court\nexplained that, in some jurisdictions, requiring a defendant to\n“investigate, over a number of cases, the race of persons tried in\nthe particular jurisdiction, the racial composition of the venire\nand petit jury, and the manner in which both parties exercised\ntheir peremptory challenges” posed an “insurmountable” burden. Ibid . In addition to that practical point, the Court\nstressed a basic equal protection point: In the eyes of the\nConstitution, one racially discriminatory peremptory strike is one\ntoo many. For those reasons, the Batson Court held\nthat a criminal defendant could show “purposeful discrimination in\nselection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the\nprosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges at the\ndefendant’s trial .” Id ., at 96 (emphasis added). Second , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s statement that a prosecutor could strike a black\njuror based on an assumption or belief that the black juror would\nfavor a black defendant. In some of the most critical sentences in\nthe Batson opinion, the Court emphasized that a prosecutor\nmay not rebut a claim of discrimination “by stating merely that he\nchallenged jurors of the defendant’s race on the assumption—or his\nintuitive judgment—that they would be partial to the defendant\nbecause of their shared race.” 476 U. S., at 97. The Court\nelaborated: The Equal Protection Clause “forbids the States to\nstrike black veniremen on the assumption that they will be biased\nin a particular case simply because the defendant is black. The\ncore guarantee of equal protection, ensuring citizens that their\nState will not discriminate on account of race, would be\nmeaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors on the basis\nof such assumptions, which arise solely from the jurors’ race.” Id., at 97–98. In his concurrence, Justice Thurgood Marshall\ndrove the point home: “Exclusion of blacks from a jury, solely\nbecause of race, can no more be justified",

Mississippi certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi No. 17–9572. Argued March 20, 2019—Decided\nJune 21, 2019 Petitioner Curtis Flowers has been tried six\nseparate times for the murder of four employees of a Mississippi\nfurniture store. Flowers is black; three of the four victims were\nwhite. At the first two trials, the State used its peremptory\nstrikes on all of the qualified black prospective jurors. In each\ncase, the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death, but\nthe convictions were later reversed by the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt based on prosecutorial misconduct. At the third trial, the\nState used all of its 15 peremptory strikes against black\nprospective jurors, and the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed again, this\ntime concluding that the State exercised its peremptory strikes on\nthe basis of race in violation of Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 . Flowers’ fourth and fifth trials ended in mistrials. At the\nfourth, the State exercised 11 peremptory strikes—all against black\nprospective jurors. No available racial information exists about\nthe prospective jurors in the fifth trial. At the sixth trial, the\nState exercised six peremptory strikes—five against black\nprospective jurors, allowing one black juror to be seated. Flowers\nagain raised a Batson claim, but the trial court concluded\nthat the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each of the\nfive peremptory strikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed. After this\nCourt vacated that judgment and remanded in light of Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt again upheld Flowers’ conviction in a divided 5-to-4\ndecision. Justice King dissented on the Batson issue and was\njoined by two other Justices. Held : All of the relevant facts\nand circumstances taken together establish that the trial court at\nFlowers’ sixth trial committed clear error in concluding that the\nState’s peremptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright\nwas not motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.\nPp. 7–31. (a) Under Batson , once a prima\nfacie case of discrimination has been shown by a defendant, the\nState must provide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes.\nThe trial judge then must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated\nreasons were the actual reasons or instead were a pretext for\ndiscrimination. The Batson Court rejected four arguments.\nFirst, the Batson Court rejected the idea that a defendant\nmust demonstrate a history of racially discriminatory strikes in\norder to make out a claim of race discrimination. Second, the Batson Court rejected the argument that a prosecutor could\nstrike a black juror based on an assumption or belief that the\nblack juror would favor a black defendant. Third, the Batson Court rejected the argument that race-based peremptories should be\npermissible because black, white, Asian, and Hispanic defendants\nand jurors were all “equally” subject to race-based discrimination.\nFourth, the Batson Court rejected the argument that\nrace-based peremptories are permissible because both the\nprosecution and defense could employ them in any individual case\nand in essence balance things out. Pp. 7–15. (b) Four categories of evidence loom\nlarge in assessing the Batson issue here, where the State\nhad a persistent pattern of striking black prospective jurors from\nFlowers’ first through his sixth trial. Pp. 15–30. (1) A review of the history of the\nState’s peremptory strikes in Flowers’ first four trials strongly\nsupports the conclusion that the State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial was motivated in substantial part by\ndiscriminatory intent. The State tried to strike all 36 black\nprospective jurors over the course of the first four trials. And\nthe state courts themselves concluded that the State had violated Batson on two separate occasions . The State’s\nrelentless, determined effort to rid the jury of black individuals\nstrongly suggests that the State wanted to try Flowers before a\njury with as few black jurors as possible, and ideally before an\nall-white jury. Pp. 19–22. (2) The State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial followed the same pattern as the first four\ntrials. Pp. 22–23. (3) Disparate questioning can be\nprobative of discriminatory intent. Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U.S.\n322 , 331–332, 344–345. Here, the State spent far more time\nquestioning the black prospective jurors than the accepted white\njurors—145 questions asked of 5 black prospective jurors and 12\nquestions asked of 11 white seated jurors. The record refutes the\nState’s explanation that it questioned black and white prospective\njurors differently only because of differences in the jurors’\ncharacteristics. Along with the historical evidence from the\nearlier trials, as well as the State’s striking of five of six\nblack prospective jurors at the sixth trial, the dramatically\ndisparate questioning and investigation of black prospective jurors\nand white prospective jurors at the sixth trial strongly suggest\nthat the State was motivated in substantial part by a\ndiscriminatory intent. Pp. 23–26. (4) Comparing prospective jurors who were\nstruck and not struck can be an important step in determining\nwhether a Batson violation occurred. See Snyder v. Louisiana , 552 U.S.\n472 , 483–484. Here, Carolyn Wright, a black prospective juror,\nwas struck, the State says, in part because she knew several\ndefense witnesses and had worked at Wal-Mart where Flowers’ father\nalso worked. But three white prospective jurors also knew many\nindividuals involved in the case, and the State asked them no\nindividual questions about their connections to witnesses. White\nprospective jurors also had relationships with members of Flowers’\nfamily, but the State did not ask them follow-up questions in order\nto explore the depth of those relationships. The State also\nincorrectly explained that it exercised a peremptory strike against\nWright because she had worked with one of Flowers’ sisters and made\napparently incorrect statements to justify the strikes of other\nblack prospective jurors. When considered with other evidence, a\nseries of factually inaccurate explanations for striking black\nprospective jurors can be another clue showing discriminatory\nintent. The overall context here requires skepticism of the State’s\nstrike of Carolyn Wright. The trial court at Flowers’ sixth trial\ncommitted clear error in concluding that the State’s peremptory\nstrike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not motivated\nin substantial part by discriminatory intent. Pp. 26–30. 240 So. 3d 1082, reversed and remanded. Kavanaugh, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 17–9572 _________________ CURTIS GIOVANNI FLOWERS, PETITIONER v. MISSISSIPPI on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi [June 21, 2019] Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. In Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 (1986), this Court ruled that a State may not discriminate\non the basis of race when exercising peremptory challenges against\nprospective jurors in a criminal trial. In 1996, Curtis Flowers allegedly murdered four\npeople in Winona, Mississippi. Flowers is black. He has been tried\nsix separate times before a jury for murder. The same lead\nprosecutor represented the State in all six trials. In the initial three trials, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed each\nconviction. In the first trial, Flowers was convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to “numerous\ninstances of prosecutorial misconduct.” Flowers v. State , 773 So. 2d 309, 327 (2000). In the second trial, the\ntrial court found that the prosecutor discriminated on the basis of\nrace in the peremptory challenge of a black juror. The trial court\nseated the black juror. Flowers was then convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court again reversed the conviction because of\nprosecutorial misconduct at trial. In the third trial, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court yet again reversed the\nconviction, this time because the court concluded that the\nprosecutor had again discriminated against black prospective jurors\nin the jury selection process. The court’s lead opinion stated:\n“The instant case presents us with as strong a prima facie case of\nracial discrimination as we have ever seen in the context of a Batson challenge.” Flowers v. State , 947 So.\n2d 910, 935 (2007). The opinion further stated that the “State\nengaged in racially discriminatory practices during the jury\nselection process” and that the “case evinces an effort by the\nState to exclude African-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. The fourth and fifth trials of Flowers ended in\nmistrials due to hung juries. In his sixth trial, which is the one at issue\nhere, Flowers was convicted. The State struck five of the six black\nprospective jurors. On appeal, Flowers argued that the State again\nviolated Batson in exercising peremptory strikes against\nblack prospective jurors. In a divided 5-to-4 decision, the\nMississippi Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. We granted\ncertiorari on the Batson question and now reverse. See 586\nU. S. ___ (2018). Four critical facts, taken together, require\nreversal. First , in the six trials combined, the State\nemployed its peremptory challenges to strike 41 of the 42 black\nprospective jurors that it could have struck—a statistic that the\nState acknowledged at oral argument in this Court. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n32. Second , in the most recent trial, the sixth trial, the\nState exercised peremptory strikes against five of the six black\nprospective jurors. Third , at the sixth trial, in an\napparent effort to find pretextual reasons to strike black\nprospective jurors, the State engaged in dramatically disparate\nquestioning of black and white prospective jurors. Fourth ,\nthe State then struck at least one black prospective juror, Carolyn\nWright, who was similarly situated to white prospective jurors who\nwere not struck by the State. We need not and do not decide that any one of\nthose four facts alone would require reversal. All that we need to\ndecide, and all that we do decide, is that all of the relevant\nfacts and circumstances taken together establish that the trial\ncourt committed clear error in concluding that the State’s\nperemptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not\n“motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.” Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016)\n(slip op., at 23) (internal quotation marks omitted). In reaching\nthat conclusion, we break no new legal ground. We simply enforce\nand reinforce Batson by applying it to the extraordinary\nfacts of this case. We reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of\nMississippi, and we remand the case for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion. I The underlying events that gave rise to this\ncase took place in Winona, Mississippi. Winona is a small town in\nnorthern Mississippi, just off I–55 almost halfway between Jackson\nand Memphis. The total population of Winona is about 5,000. The\ntown is about 53 percent black and about 46 percent white. In 1996, Bertha Tardy, Robert Golden, Derrick\nStewart, and Carmen Rigby were murdered at the Tardy Furniture\nstore in Winona. All four victims worked at the Tardy Furniture\nstore. Three of the four victims were white; one was black. In\n1997, the State charged Curtis Flowers with murder. Flowers is\nblack. Since then, Flowers has been tried six separate times for\nthe murders. In each of the first two trials, Flowers was tried for\none individual murder. In each subsequent trial, Flowers was tried\nfor all four of the murders together. The same state prosecutor\ntried Flowers each time. The prosecutor is white. At Flowers’ first trial, 36 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 31 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nThe State exercised a total of 12 peremptory strikes, and it used 5\nof them to strike the five qualified black prospective jurors.\nFlowers objected, arguing under Batson that the State had\nexercised its peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory\nmanner. The trial court rejected the Batson challenge.\nBecause the trial court allowed the State’s peremptory strikes,\nFlowers was tried in front of an all-white jury. The jury convicted\nFlowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court\nreversed the conviction, concluding that the State had committed\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, expressing baseless grounds for doubting the credibility of\nwitnesses and mentioning facts that had not been allowed into\nevidence by the trial judge. Flowers , 773 So. 2d, at\n317, 334. In its opinion, the Mississippi Supreme Court described\n“numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct” at the trial. Id., at 327. Because the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed\nbased on prosecutorial misconduct at trial, the court did not reach\nFlowers’ Batson argument. See Flowers , 773\nSo. 2d, at 327 . At the second trial, 30 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 25 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nAs in Flowers’ first trial, the State again used its strikes\nagainst all five black prospective jurors. But this time, the trial\ncourt determined that the State’s asserted reason for one of the\nstrikes was a pretext for discrimination. Specifically, the trial\ncourt determined that one of the State’s proffered reasons—that the\njuror had been inattentive and was nodding off during jury\nselection—for striking that juror was false, and the trial court\ntherefore sustained Flowers’ Batson challenge. The trial\ncourt disallowed the strike and sat that black juror on the jury.\nThe jury at Flowers’ second trial consisted of 11 white jurors and\n1 black juror. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to\ndeath. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court again\nreversed. The court ruled that the prosecutor had again engaged in\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, impermissibly referencing evidence and attempting to\nundermine witness credibility without a factual basis. See Flowers v. State , 842 So. 2d 531, 538, 553\n(2003). At Flowers’ third trial, 45 prospective\njurors—17 black and 28 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. One of the black prospective jurors was struck for cause,\nleaving 16. The State exercised a total of 15 peremptory strikes,\nand it used all 15 against black prospective jurors. Flowers again\nargued that the State had used its peremptory strikes in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner. The trial court found that the State had not\ndiscriminated on the basis of race. See Flowers , 947\nSo. 2d, at 916. The jury in Flowers’ third trial consisted of\n11 white jurors and 1 black juror. The lone black juror who served\non the jury was seated after the State ran out of peremptory\nstrikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court yet\nagain reversed, concluding that the State had again violated Batson by discriminating on the basis of race in exercising\nall 15 of its peremptory strikes against 15 black prospective\njurors. See Flowers , 947 So. 2d, at 939. The court’s\nlead opinion stated: “The instant case presents us with as strong a\nprima facie case of racial discrimination as we have ever seen in\nthe context of a Batson challenge.” Id., at 935. The\nopinion explained that although “each individual strike may have\njustifiably appeared to the trial court to be sufficiently race\nneutral, the trial court also has a duty to look at the State’s use\nof peremptory challenges in toto .” Id., at 937.\nThe opinion emphasized that “trial judges should not blindly accept\nany and every reason put forth by the State, especially” when “the\nState continues to exercise challenge after challenge only upon\nmembers of a particular race.” Ibid . The opinion added that\nthe “State engaged in racially discriminatory practices” and that\nthe “case evinces an effort by the State to exclude\nAfrican-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. At Flowers’ fourth trial, 36 prospective\njurors—16 black and 20 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. The State exercised a total of 11 peremptory strikes, and\nit used all 11 against black prospective jurors. But because of the\nrelatively large number of prospective jurors who were black, the\nState did not have enough peremptory challenges to eliminate all of\nthe black prospective jurors. The seated jury consisted of seven\nwhite jurors and five black jurors. That jury could not reach a\nverdict, and the proceeding ended in a mistrial. As to the fifth trial, there is no available\nracial information about the prospective jurors, as distinct from\nthe jurors who ultimately sat on the jury. The jury was composed of\nnine white jurors and three black jurors. The jury could not reach\na verdict, and the trial again ended in a mistrial. At the sixth trial, which we consider here, 26\nprospective jurors—6 black and 20 white—were presented to\npotentially serve on the jury. The State exercised a total of six\nperemptory strikes, and it used five of the six against black\nprospective jurors, leaving one black juror to sit on the jury.\nFlowers again argued that the State had exercised its peremptory\nstrikes in a racially discrimina-tory manner. The trial court\nconcluded that the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each\nof the five peremp-tory strikes against the five black prospective\njurors. The jury at Flowers’ sixth trial consisted of 11 white\njurors and 1 black juror. That jury convicted Flowers of murder and\nsentenced him to death. In a divided decision, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt agreed with the trial court on the Batson issue and\nstated that the State’s “race-neutral reasons were valid and not\nmerely pretextual.” Flowers v. State , 158 So. 3d\n1009, 1058 (2014). Flowers then sought review in this Court. This\nCourt granted Flowers’ petition for a writ of certio-rari, vacated\nthe judgment of the Mississippi Supreme Court, and remanded for\nfurther consideration in light of the decision in Foster ,\n578 U. S. ___. Flowers v. Mississippi , 579\nU. S. ___ (2016). In Foster , this Court held that the\ndefendant Foster had established a Batson violation. 578\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 25). On remand, the Mississippi Supreme Court by a\n5-to-4 vote again upheld Flowers’ conviction. See 240 So. 3d 1082\n(2017). Justice King wrote a dissent for three justices. He stated:\n“I cannot conclude that Flowers received a fair trial, nor can I\nconclude that prospective jurors were not subjected to\nimpermissible discrimination.” Id ., at 1172. According to\nJustice King, both the trial court and the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt “completely disregard[ed] the constitutional right of\nprospective jurors to be free from a racially discriminatory\nselection process.” Id., at 1171. We granted certiorari. See\n586 U. S. ___. II A Other than voting, serving on a jury is the\nmost substantial opportunity that most citizens have to participate\nin the democratic process. See Powers v. Ohio , 499 U.S.\n400 , 407 (1991). Jury selection in criminal cases varies\nsignificantly based on state and local rules and practices, but\nordinarily consists of three phases, which we describe here in\ngeneral terms. First , a group of citizens in the community\nis randomly summoned to the courthouse on a particular day for\npotential jury service. Second , a subgroup of those\nprospective jurors is called into a particular courtroom for a\nspecific case. The prospective jurors are often questioned by the\njudge, as well as by the prosecutor and defense attorney. During\nthat second phase, the judge may excuse certain prospective jurors\nbased on their answers. Third , the prosecutor and defense\nattorney may challenge certain prospective jurors. The attorneys\nmay challenge prospective jurors for cause, which usually stems\nfrom a potential juror’s conflicts of interest or inability to be\nimpartial. In addition to challenges for cause, each side is\ntypically afforded a set number of peremptory challenges or\nstrikes. Peremptory strikes have very old credentials and can be\ntraced back to the common law. Those peremptory strikes\ntraditionally may be used to remove any potential juror for any\nreason—no questions asked. That blanket discretion to peremptorily strike\nprospective jurors for any reason can clash with the dictates of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. This case arises at the intersection of\nthe peremptory challenge and the Equal Protection Clause. And to\nunderstand how equal protection law applies to peremptory\nchallenges, it helps to begin at the beginning. Ratified in 1868 in the wake of the Civil War,\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides\nthat no State shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\nequal protection of the laws.” A primary objective of the Equal\nProtection Clause, this Court stated just five years after\nratification, was “the freedom of the slave race, the security and\nfirm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the\nnewly-made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who\nhad formerly exercised unlimited dominion over him.” Slaughter-House Cases , 16 Wall. 36, 71 (1873). In 1875, to help enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Congress passed and President Ulysses S. Grant signed\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1875. Ch. 114, 18Stat. 335. Among other\nthings, that law made it a criminal offense for state officials to\nexclude individuals from jury service on account of their race. 18\nU. S. C. §243. The Act provides: “No citizen possessing\nall other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by law\nshall be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any\ncourt of the United States, or of any State on account of race,\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.” In 1880, just 12 years after ratification of the\nFourteenth Amendment, the Court decided Strauder v. West\nVirginia , 100 U.S.\n303 . That case concerned a West Virginia statute that allowed\nwhites only to serve as jurors. The Court held the law\nunconstitutional. In reaching its conclusion, the Court explained\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment required “that the law in the States\nshall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons,\nwhether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the\nStates, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose protection\nthe amendment was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall\nbe made against them by law because of their color.” Id., at\n307. In the words of the Strauder Court: “The very fact that\ncolored people are singled out and expressly denied by a statute\nall right to participate in the administration of the law, as\njurors, because of their color, though they are citizens, and may\nbe in other respects fully qualified, is practically a brand upon\nthem, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority, and a\nstimulant to that race prejudice which is an impediment to securing\nto individuals of the race that equal justice which the law aims to\nsecure to all others.” Id ., at 308. For those reasons, the\nCourt ruled that the West Virginia statute exclud- ing blacks from\njury service violated the Fourteenth Amendment. As the Court later explained in Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U.S.\n483 (1954), the Court’s decisions in the Slaughter-House\nCases and Strauder interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment\n“as proscribing all state-imposed discriminations against the Negro\nrace,” including in jury service. Brown , 347 U. S., at\n490. In the decades after Strauder , the Court\nreiterated that States may not discriminate on the basis of race in\njury selection. See, e.g., Neal v. Delaware , 103 U.S.\n370 , 397 (1881); Carter v. Texas , 177 U.S.\n442 , 447 (1900); Norris v. Alabama , 294 U.S.\n587 , 597–599 (1935); Hale v. Kentucky , 303 U.S.\n613 , 616 (1938) ( per curiam ); Pierre v. Louisiana , 306 U.S.\n354 , 362 (1939); Smith v. Texas , 311 U.S.\n128 , 130–131 (1940); Avery v. Georgia , 345 U.S.\n559 , 562 (1953); Hernandez v. Texas , 347 U.S.\n475 , 477–478, 482 (1954); Coleman v. Alabama , 377 U.S.\n129 , 133 (1964). But critical problems persisted. Even though\nlaws barring blacks from serving on juries were unconstitutional\nafter Strauder , many jurisdictions employed various\ndiscriminatory tools to prevent black persons from being called for\njury service. And when those tactics failed, or were invalidated,\nprosecutors could still exercise peremptory strikes in individual\ncases to remove most or all black prospective jurors. In the century after Strauder , the\nfreedom to exercise peremptory strikes for any reason meant that\n“the problem of racial exclusion from jury service” remained\n“widespread” and “deeply entrenched.” 5 U. S. Commission on\nCivil Rights Report 90 (1961). Simple math shows how that happened.\nGiven that blacks were a minority of the population, in many\njurisdictions the number of peremp-tory strikes available to the\nprosecutor exceeded the number of black prospective jurors. So\nprosecutors could routinely exercise peremptories to strike all the\nblack prospective jurors and thereby ensure all-white juries. The\nexclusion of black prospective jurors was almost total in certain\njurisdictions, especially in cases involving black defendants.\nSimilarly, defense counsel could use—and routinely did\nuse—peremptory challenges to strike all the black prospective\njurors in cases involving white defendants and black victims. In the aftermath of Strauder , the\nexclusion of black jurors became more covert and less overt—often\naccomplished through peremptory challenges in individual courtrooms\nrather than by blanket operation of law. But as this Court later\nnoted, the results were the same for black jurors and black\ndefendants, as well as for the black community’s confidence in the\nfairness of the American criminal justice system. See Batson , 476 U. S., at 98–99. Eighty-five years after Strauder , the\nCourt decided Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S.\n202 (1965). The defendant Swain was black. Swain was convicted\nof a capital offense in Talladega County, Alabama, and sentenced to\ndeath. Swain presented evidence that no black juror had served on a\njury in Talladega County in more than a decade. See id . , at 226. And in Swain’s case, the prosecutor\nstruck all six qualified black prospective jurors, ensuring that\nSwain was tried before an all-white jury. Swain invoked Strauder to argue that the prosecutor in his case had\nimpermis-sibly discriminated on the basis of race by using\nperemptory challenges to strike the six black prospective jurors.\nSee 380 U. S., at 203, 210. This Court ruled that Swain had not established\nunconstitutional discrimination. Most importantly, the Court held\nthat a defendant could not object to the State’s use of peremptory\nstrikes in an individual case. In the Court’s words: “[W]e cannot\nhold that the striking of Negroes in a particular case is a denial\nof equal protection of the laws.” Id., at 221. The Swain Court reasoned that prosecutors do not always judge\nprospective jurors individually when exercising peremptory strikes.\nInstead, prosecutors choose which prospective jurors to strike “in\nlight of the limited knowledge counsel has of them, which may\ninclude their group affiliations, in the context of the case to be\ntried.” Ibid . In the Court’s view, the prosecutor could\nstrike prospective jurors on the basis of their group affiliations,\nincluding race. In other words, a prosecutor could permissibly\nstrike a prospective juror for any reason, including the assumption\nor belief that a black prospective juror, because of race, would be\nfavorable to a black defendant or unfavorable to the State. See id., at 220–221. To be sure, the Swain Court held that a\ndefendant could make out a case of racial discrimination by showing\nthat the State “in case after case, whatever the circumstances,\nwhatever the crime and whoever the defendant or the victim may be,”\nhad been responsible for the removal of qualified black prospective\njurors so that no black jurors “ever serve on petit juries.” Id., at 223. But Swain ’s high bar for establishing a\nconstitutional violation was almost impossible for any defendant to\nsurmount, as the aftermath of Swain amply\ndemonstrated . Twenty-one years later, in its 1986 decision in Batson , the Court revisited several critical aspects of Swain and in essence overruled them. In so doing, the Batson Court emphasized that “the central concern” of the\nFourteenth Amendment “was to put an end to governmental\ndiscrimination on account of race.” 476 U. S., at 85. The Batson Court noted that Swain had left prosecutors’\nperemptory challenges “largely immune from constitutional\nscrutiny.” 476 U. S., at 92–93. In his concurrence in Batson , Justice Byron White (the author of Swain )\nagreed that Swain should be overruled. He stated: “[T]he\npractice of peremptorily eliminating blacks from petit juries in\ncases with black defendants remains widespread, so much so” that “I\nagree with the Court that the time has come to rule as it has.” 476\nU. S., at 101–102. Under Batson , once a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination has been shown by a defendant, the State must\nprovide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes. The trial\njudge must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated reasons were\nthe actual reasons or instead were a pretext for discrimination. Id., at 97–98. Four parts of Batson warrant particular\nemphasis here. First , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s insistence that a defendant demonstrate a history of\nracially discriminatory strikes in order to make out a claim of\nrace discrimination. See 476 U. S., at 95. According to the Batson Court, defendants had run into “practical\ndifficulties” in trying to prove that a State had systematically\n“exercised peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury on\naccount of race.” Id ., at 92, n. 17. The Batson Court\nexplained that, in some jurisdictions, requiring a defendant to\n“investigate, over a number of cases, the race of persons tried in\nthe particular jurisdiction, the racial composition of the venire\nand petit jury, and the manner in which both parties exercised\ntheir peremptory challenges” posed an “insurmountable” burden. Ibid . In addition to that practical point, the Court\nstressed a basic equal protection point: In the eyes of the\nConstitution, one racially discriminatory peremptory strike is one\ntoo many. For those reasons, the Batson Court held\nthat a criminal defendant could show “purposeful discrimination in\nselection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the\nprosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges at the\ndefendant’s trial .” Id ., at 96 (emphasis added). Second , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s statement that a prosecutor could strike a black\njuror based on an assumption or belief that the black juror would\nfavor a black defendant. In some of the most critical sentences in\nthe Batson opinion, the Court emphasized that a prosecutor\nmay not rebut a claim of discrimination “by stating merely that he\nchallenged jurors of the defendant’s race on the assumption—or his\nintuitive judgment—that they would be partial to the defendant\nbecause of their shared race.” 476 U. S., at 97. The Court\nelaborated: The Equal Protection Clause “forbids the States to\nstrike black veniremen on the assumption that they will be biased\nin a particular case simply because the defendant is black. The\ncore guarantee of equal protection, ensuring citizens that their\nState will not discriminate on account of race, would be\nmeaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors on the basis\nof such assumptions, which arise solely from the jurors’ race.” Id., at 97–98. In his concurrence, Justice Thurgood Marshall\ndrove the point home: “Exclusion of blacks from a jury, solely\nbecause of race, can no more be justified",

Mississippi certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi No. 17–9572. Argued March 20, 2019—Decided\nJune 21, 2019 Petitioner Curtis Flowers has been tried six\nseparate times for the murder of four employees of a Mississippi\nfurniture store. Flowers is black; three of the four victims were\nwhite. At the first two trials, the State used its peremptory\nstrikes on all of the qualified black prospective jurors. In each\ncase, the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death, but\nthe convictions were later reversed by the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt based on prosecutorial misconduct. At the third trial, the\nState used all of its 15 peremptory strikes against black\nprospective jurors, and the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed again, this\ntime concluding that the State exercised its peremptory strikes on\nthe basis of race in violation of Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 . Flowers’ fourth and fifth trials ended in mistrials. At the\nfourth, the State exercised 11 peremptory strikes—all against black\nprospective jurors. No available racial information exists about\nthe prospective jurors in the fifth trial. At the sixth trial, the\nState exercised six peremptory strikes—five against black\nprospective jurors, allowing one black juror to be seated. Flowers\nagain raised a Batson claim, but the trial court concluded\nthat the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each of the\nfive peremptory strikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed. After this\nCourt vacated that judgment and remanded in light of Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt again upheld Flowers’ conviction in a divided 5-to-4\ndecision. Justice King dissented on the Batson issue and was\njoined by two other Justices. Held : All of the relevant facts\nand circumstances taken together establish that the trial court at\nFlowers’ sixth trial committed clear error in concluding that the\nState’s peremptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright\nwas not motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.\nPp. 7–31. (a) Under Batson , once a prima\nfacie case of discrimination has been shown by a defendant, the\nState must provide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes.\nThe trial judge then must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated\nreasons were the actual reasons or instead were a pretext for\ndiscrimination. The Batson Court rejected four arguments.\nFirst, the Batson Court rejected the idea that a defendant\nmust demonstrate a history of racially discriminatory strikes in\norder to make out a claim of race discrimination. Second, the Batson Court rejected the argument that a prosecutor could\nstrike a black juror based on an assumption or belief that the\nblack juror would favor a black defendant. Third, the Batson Court rejected the argument that race-based peremptories should be\npermissible because black, white, Asian, and Hispanic defendants\nand jurors were all “equally” subject to race-based discrimination.\nFourth, the Batson Court rejected the argument that\nrace-based peremptories are permissible because both the\nprosecution and defense could employ them in any individual case\nand in essence balance things out. Pp. 7–15. (b) Four categories of evidence loom\nlarge in assessing the Batson issue here, where the State\nhad a persistent pattern of striking black prospective jurors from\nFlowers’ first through his sixth trial. Pp. 15–30. (1) A review of the history of the\nState’s peremptory strikes in Flowers’ first four trials strongly\nsupports the conclusion that the State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial was motivated in substantial part by\ndiscriminatory intent. The State tried to strike all 36 black\nprospective jurors over the course of the first four trials. And\nthe state courts themselves concluded that the State had violated Batson on two separate occasions . The State’s\nrelentless, determined effort to rid the jury of black individuals\nstrongly suggests that the State wanted to try Flowers before a\njury with as few black jurors as possible, and ideally before an\nall-white jury. Pp. 19–22. (2) The State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial followed the same pattern as the first four\ntrials. Pp. 22–23. (3) Disparate questioning can be\nprobative of discriminatory intent. Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U.S.\n322 , 331–332, 344–345. Here, the State spent far more time\nquestioning the black prospective jurors than the accepted white\njurors—145 questions asked of 5 black prospective jurors and 12\nquestions asked of 11 white seated jurors. The record refutes the\nState’s explanation that it questioned black and white prospective\njurors differently only because of differences in the jurors’\ncharacteristics. Along with the historical evidence from the\nearlier trials, as well as the State’s striking of five of six\nblack prospective jurors at the sixth trial, the dramatically\ndisparate questioning and investigation of black prospective jurors\nand white prospective jurors at the sixth trial strongly suggest\nthat the State was motivated in substantial part by a\ndiscriminatory intent. Pp. 23–26. (4) Comparing prospective jurors who were\nstruck and not struck can be an important step in determining\nwhether a Batson violation occurred. See Snyder v. Louisiana , 552 U.S.\n472 , 483–484. Here, Carolyn Wright, a black prospective juror,\nwas struck, the State says, in part because she knew several\ndefense witnesses and had worked at Wal-Mart where Flowers’ father\nalso worked. But three white prospective jurors also knew many\nindividuals involved in the case, and the State asked them no\nindividual questions about their connections to witnesses. White\nprospective jurors also had relationships with members of Flowers’\nfamily, but the State did not ask them follow-up questions in order\nto explore the depth of those relationships. The State also\nincorrectly explained that it exercised a peremptory strike against\nWright because she had worked with one of Flowers’ sisters and made\napparently incorrect statements to justify the strikes of other\nblack prospective jurors. When considered with other evidence, a\nseries of factually inaccurate explanations for striking black\nprospective jurors can be another clue showing discriminatory\nintent. The overall context here requires skepticism of the State’s\nstrike of Carolyn Wright. The trial court at Flowers’ sixth trial\ncommitted clear error in concluding that the State’s peremptory\nstrike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not motivated\nin substantial part by discriminatory intent. Pp. 26–30. 240 So. 3d 1082, reversed and remanded. Kavanaugh, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 17–9572 _________________ CURTIS GIOVANNI FLOWERS, PETITIONER v. MISSISSIPPI on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi [June 21, 2019] Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. In Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 (1986), this Court ruled that a State may not discriminate\non the basis of race when exercising peremptory challenges against\nprospective jurors in a criminal trial. In 1996, Curtis Flowers allegedly murdered four\npeople in Winona, Mississippi. Flowers is black. He has been tried\nsix separate times before a jury for murder. The same lead\nprosecutor represented the State in all six trials. In the initial three trials, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed each\nconviction. In the first trial, Flowers was convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to “numerous\ninstances of prosecutorial misconduct.” Flowers v. State , 773 So. 2d 309, 327 (2000). In the second trial, the\ntrial court found that the prosecutor discriminated on the basis of\nrace in the peremptory challenge of a black juror. The trial court\nseated the black juror. Flowers was then convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court again reversed the conviction because of\nprosecutorial misconduct at trial. In the third trial, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court yet again reversed the\nconviction, this time because the court concluded that the\nprosecutor had again discriminated against black prospective jurors\nin the jury selection process. The court’s lead opinion stated:\n“The instant case presents us with as strong a prima facie case of\nracial discrimination as we have ever seen in the context of a Batson challenge.” Flowers v. State , 947 So.\n2d 910, 935 (2007). The opinion further stated that the “State\nengaged in racially discriminatory practices during the jury\nselection process” and that the “case evinces an effort by the\nState to exclude African-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. The fourth and fifth trials of Flowers ended in\nmistrials due to hung juries. In his sixth trial, which is the one at issue\nhere, Flowers was convicted. The State struck five of the six black\nprospective jurors. On appeal, Flowers argued that the State again\nviolated Batson in exercising peremptory strikes against\nblack prospective jurors. In a divided 5-to-4 decision, the\nMississippi Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. We granted\ncertiorari on the Batson question and now reverse. See 586\nU. S. ___ (2018). Four critical facts, taken together, require\nreversal. First , in the six trials combined, the State\nemployed its peremptory challenges to strike 41 of the 42 black\nprospective jurors that it could have struck—a statistic that the\nState acknowledged at oral argument in this Court. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n32. Second , in the most recent trial, the sixth trial, the\nState exercised peremptory strikes against five of the six black\nprospective jurors. Third , at the sixth trial, in an\napparent effort to find pretextual reasons to strike black\nprospective jurors, the State engaged in dramatically disparate\nquestioning of black and white prospective jurors. Fourth ,\nthe State then struck at least one black prospective juror, Carolyn\nWright, who was similarly situated to white prospective jurors who\nwere not struck by the State. We need not and do not decide that any one of\nthose four facts alone would require reversal. All that we need to\ndecide, and all that we do decide, is that all of the relevant\nfacts and circumstances taken together establish that the trial\ncourt committed clear error in concluding that the State’s\nperemptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not\n“motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.” Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016)\n(slip op., at 23) (internal quotation marks omitted). In reaching\nthat conclusion, we break no new legal ground. We simply enforce\nand reinforce Batson by applying it to the extraordinary\nfacts of this case. We reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of\nMississippi, and we remand the case for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion. I The underlying events that gave rise to this\ncase took place in Winona, Mississippi. Winona is a small town in\nnorthern Mississippi, just off I–55 almost halfway between Jackson\nand Memphis. The total population of Winona is about 5,000. The\ntown is about 53 percent black and about 46 percent white. In 1996, Bertha Tardy, Robert Golden, Derrick\nStewart, and Carmen Rigby were murdered at the Tardy Furniture\nstore in Winona. All four victims worked at the Tardy Furniture\nstore. Three of the four victims were white; one was black. In\n1997, the State charged Curtis Flowers with murder. Flowers is\nblack. Since then, Flowers has been tried six separate times for\nthe murders. In each of the first two trials, Flowers was tried for\none individual murder. In each subsequent trial, Flowers was tried\nfor all four of the murders together. The same state prosecutor\ntried Flowers each time. The prosecutor is white. At Flowers’ first trial, 36 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 31 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nThe State exercised a total of 12 peremptory strikes, and it used 5\nof them to strike the five qualified black prospective jurors.\nFlowers objected, arguing under Batson that the State had\nexercised its peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory\nmanner. The trial court rejected the Batson challenge.\nBecause the trial court allowed the State’s peremptory strikes,\nFlowers was tried in front of an all-white jury. The jury convicted\nFlowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court\nreversed the conviction, concluding that the State had committed\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, expressing baseless grounds for doubting the credibility of\nwitnesses and mentioning facts that had not been allowed into\nevidence by the trial judge. Flowers , 773 So. 2d, at\n317, 334. In its opinion, the Mississippi Supreme Court described\n“numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct” at the trial. Id., at 327. Because the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed\nbased on prosecutorial misconduct at trial, the court did not reach\nFlowers’ Batson argument. See Flowers , 773\nSo. 2d, at 327 . At the second trial, 30 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 25 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nAs in Flowers’ first trial, the State again used its strikes\nagainst all five black prospective jurors. But this time, the trial\ncourt determined that the State’s asserted reason for one of the\nstrikes was a pretext for discrimination. Specifically, the trial\ncourt determined that one of the State’s proffered reasons—that the\njuror had been inattentive and was nodding off during jury\nselection—for striking that juror was false, and the trial court\ntherefore sustained Flowers’ Batson challenge. The trial\ncourt disallowed the strike and sat that black juror on the jury.\nThe jury at Flowers’ second trial consisted of 11 white jurors and\n1 black juror. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to\ndeath. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court again\nreversed. The court ruled that the prosecutor had again engaged in\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, impermissibly referencing evidence and attempting to\nundermine witness credibility without a factual basis. See Flowers v. State , 842 So. 2d 531, 538, 553\n(2003). At Flowers’ third trial, 45 prospective\njurors—17 black and 28 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. One of the black prospective jurors was struck for cause,\nleaving 16. The State exercised a total of 15 peremptory strikes,\nand it used all 15 against black prospective jurors. Flowers again\nargued that the State had used its peremptory strikes in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner. The trial court found that the State had not\ndiscriminated on the basis of race. See Flowers , 947\nSo. 2d, at 916. The jury in Flowers’ third trial consisted of\n11 white jurors and 1 black juror. The lone black juror who served\non the jury was seated after the State ran out of peremptory\nstrikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court yet\nagain reversed, concluding that the State had again violated Batson by discriminating on the basis of race in exercising\nall 15 of its peremptory strikes against 15 black prospective\njurors. See Flowers , 947 So. 2d, at 939. The court’s\nlead opinion stated: “The instant case presents us with as strong a\nprima facie case of racial discrimination as we have ever seen in\nthe context of a Batson challenge.” Id., at 935. The\nopinion explained that although “each individual strike may have\njustifiably appeared to the trial court to be sufficiently race\nneutral, the trial court also has a duty to look at the State’s use\nof peremptory challenges in toto .” Id., at 937.\nThe opinion emphasized that “trial judges should not blindly accept\nany and every reason put forth by the State, especially” when “the\nState continues to exercise challenge after challenge only upon\nmembers of a particular race.” Ibid . The opinion added that\nthe “State engaged in racially discriminatory practices” and that\nthe “case evinces an effort by the State to exclude\nAfrican-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. At Flowers’ fourth trial, 36 prospective\njurors—16 black and 20 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. The State exercised a total of 11 peremptory strikes, and\nit used all 11 against black prospective jurors. But because of the\nrelatively large number of prospective jurors who were black, the\nState did not have enough peremptory challenges to eliminate all of\nthe black prospective jurors. The seated jury consisted of seven\nwhite jurors and five black jurors. That jury could not reach a\nverdict, and the proceeding ended in a mistrial. As to the fifth trial, there is no available\nracial information about the prospective jurors, as distinct from\nthe jurors who ultimately sat on the jury. The jury was composed of\nnine white jurors and three black jurors. The jury could not reach\na verdict, and the trial again ended in a mistrial. At the sixth trial, which we consider here, 26\nprospective jurors—6 black and 20 white—were presented to\npotentially serve on the jury. The State exercised a total of six\nperemptory strikes, and it used five of the six against black\nprospective jurors, leaving one black juror to sit on the jury.\nFlowers again argued that the State had exercised its peremptory\nstrikes in a racially discrimina-tory manner. The trial court\nconcluded that the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each\nof the five peremp-tory strikes against the five black prospective\njurors. The jury at Flowers’ sixth trial consisted of 11 white\njurors and 1 black juror. That jury convicted Flowers of murder and\nsentenced him to death. In a divided decision, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt agreed with the trial court on the Batson issue and\nstated that the State’s “race-neutral reasons were valid and not\nmerely pretextual.” Flowers v. State , 158 So. 3d\n1009, 1058 (2014). Flowers then sought review in this Court. This\nCourt granted Flowers’ petition for a writ of certio-rari, vacated\nthe judgment of the Mississippi Supreme Court, and remanded for\nfurther consideration in light of the decision in Foster ,\n578 U. S. ___. Flowers v. Mississippi , 579\nU. S. ___ (2016). In Foster , this Court held that the\ndefendant Foster had established a Batson violation. 578\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 25). On remand, the Mississippi Supreme Court by a\n5-to-4 vote again upheld Flowers’ conviction. See 240 So. 3d 1082\n(2017). Justice King wrote a dissent for three justices. He stated:\n“I cannot conclude that Flowers received a fair trial, nor can I\nconclude that prospective jurors were not subjected to\nimpermissible discrimination.” Id ., at 1172. According to\nJustice King, both the trial court and the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt “completely disregard[ed] the constitutional right of\nprospective jurors to be free from a racially discriminatory\nselection process.” Id., at 1171. We granted certiorari. See\n586 U. S. ___. II A Other than voting, serving on a jury is the\nmost substantial opportunity that most citizens have to participate\nin the democratic process. See Powers v. Ohio , 499 U.S.\n400 , 407 (1991). Jury selection in criminal cases varies\nsignificantly based on state and local rules and practices, but\nordinarily consists of three phases, which we describe here in\ngeneral terms. First , a group of citizens in the community\nis randomly summoned to the courthouse on a particular day for\npotential jury service. Second , a subgroup of those\nprospective jurors is called into a particular courtroom for a\nspecific case. The prospective jurors are often questioned by the\njudge, as well as by the prosecutor and defense attorney. During\nthat second phase, the judge may excuse certain prospective jurors\nbased on their answers. Third , the prosecutor and defense\nattorney may challenge certain prospective jurors. The attorneys\nmay challenge prospective jurors for cause, which usually stems\nfrom a potential juror’s conflicts of interest or inability to be\nimpartial. In addition to challenges for cause, each side is\ntypically afforded a set number of peremptory challenges or\nstrikes. Peremptory strikes have very old credentials and can be\ntraced back to the common law. Those peremptory strikes\ntraditionally may be used to remove any potential juror for any\nreason—no questions asked. That blanket discretion to peremptorily strike\nprospective jurors for any reason can clash with the dictates of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. This case arises at the intersection of\nthe peremptory challenge and the Equal Protection Clause. And to\nunderstand how equal protection law applies to peremptory\nchallenges, it helps to begin at the beginning. Ratified in 1868 in the wake of the Civil War,\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides\nthat no State shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\nequal protection of the laws.” A primary objective of the Equal\nProtection Clause, this Court stated just five years after\nratification, was “the freedom of the slave race, the security and\nfirm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the\nnewly-made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who\nhad formerly exercised unlimited dominion over him.” Slaughter-House Cases , 16 Wall. 36, 71 (1873). In 1875, to help enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Congress passed and President Ulysses S. Grant signed\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1875. Ch. 114, 18Stat. 335. Among other\nthings, that law made it a criminal offense for state officials to\nexclude individuals from jury service on account of their race. 18\nU. S. C. §243. The Act provides: “No citizen possessing\nall other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by law\nshall be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any\ncourt of the United States, or of any State on account of race,\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.” In 1880, just 12 years after ratification of the\nFourteenth Amendment, the Court decided Strauder v. West\nVirginia , 100 U.S.\n303 . That case concerned a West Virginia statute that allowed\nwhites only to serve as jurors. The Court held the law\nunconstitutional. In reaching its conclusion, the Court explained\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment required “that the law in the States\nshall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons,\nwhether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the\nStates, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose protection\nthe amendment was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall\nbe made against them by law because of their color.” Id., at\n307. In the words of the Strauder Court: “The very fact that\ncolored people are singled out and expressly denied by a statute\nall right to participate in the administration of the law, as\njurors, because of their color, though they are citizens, and may\nbe in other respects fully qualified, is practically a brand upon\nthem, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority, and a\nstimulant to that race prejudice which is an impediment to securing\nto individuals of the race that equal justice which the law aims to\nsecure to all others.” Id ., at 308. For those reasons, the\nCourt ruled that the West Virginia statute exclud- ing blacks from\njury service violated the Fourteenth Amendment. As the Court later explained in Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U.S.\n483 (1954), the Court’s decisions in the Slaughter-House\nCases and Strauder interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment\n“as proscribing all state-imposed discriminations against the Negro\nrace,” including in jury service. Brown , 347 U. S., at\n490. In the decades after Strauder , the Court\nreiterated that States may not discriminate on the basis of race in\njury selection. See, e.g., Neal v. Delaware , 103 U.S.\n370 , 397 (1881); Carter v. Texas , 177 U.S.\n442 , 447 (1900); Norris v. Alabama , 294 U.S.\n587 , 597–599 (1935); Hale v. Kentucky , 303 U.S.\n613 , 616 (1938) ( per curiam ); Pierre v. Louisiana , 306 U.S.\n354 , 362 (1939); Smith v. Texas , 311 U.S.\n128 , 130–131 (1940); Avery v. Georgia , 345 U.S.\n559 , 562 (1953); Hernandez v. Texas , 347 U.S.\n475 , 477–478, 482 (1954); Coleman v. Alabama , 377 U.S.\n129 , 133 (1964). But critical problems persisted. Even though\nlaws barring blacks from serving on juries were unconstitutional\nafter Strauder , many jurisdictions employed various\ndiscriminatory tools to prevent black persons from being called for\njury service. And when those tactics failed, or were invalidated,\nprosecutors could still exercise peremptory strikes in individual\ncases to remove most or all black prospective jurors. In the century after Strauder , the\nfreedom to exercise peremptory strikes for any reason meant that\n“the problem of racial exclusion from jury service” remained\n“widespread” and “deeply entrenched.” 5 U. S. Commission on\nCivil Rights Report 90 (1961). Simple math shows how that happened.\nGiven that blacks were a minority of the population, in many\njurisdictions the number of peremp-tory strikes available to the\nprosecutor exceeded the number of black prospective jurors. So\nprosecutors could routinely exercise peremptories to strike all the\nblack prospective jurors and thereby ensure all-white juries. The\nexclusion of black prospective jurors was almost total in certain\njurisdictions, especially in cases involving black defendants.\nSimilarly, defense counsel could use—and routinely did\nuse—peremptory challenges to strike all the black prospective\njurors in cases involving white defendants and black victims. In the aftermath of Strauder , the\nexclusion of black jurors became more covert and less overt—often\naccomplished through peremptory challenges in individual courtrooms\nrather than by blanket operation of law. But as this Court later\nnoted, the results were the same for black jurors and black\ndefendants, as well as for the black community’s confidence in the\nfairness of the American criminal justice system. See Batson , 476 U. S., at 98–99. Eighty-five years after Strauder , the\nCourt decided Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S.\n202 (1965). The defendant Swain was black. Swain was convicted\nof a capital offense in Talladega County, Alabama, and sentenced to\ndeath. Swain presented evidence that no black juror had served on a\njury in Talladega County in more than a decade. See id . , at 226. And in Swain’s case, the prosecutor\nstruck all six qualified black prospective jurors, ensuring that\nSwain was tried before an all-white jury. Swain invoked Strauder to argue that the prosecutor in his case had\nimpermis-sibly discriminated on the basis of race by using\nperemptory challenges to strike the six black prospective jurors.\nSee 380 U. S., at 203, 210. This Court ruled that Swain had not established\nunconstitutional discrimination. Most importantly, the Court held\nthat a defendant could not object to the State’s use of peremptory\nstrikes in an individual case. In the Court’s words: “[W]e cannot\nhold that the striking of Negroes in a particular case is a denial\nof equal protection of the laws.” Id., at 221. The Swain Court reasoned that prosecutors do not always judge\nprospective jurors individually when exercising peremptory strikes.\nInstead, prosecutors choose which prospective jurors to strike “in\nlight of the limited knowledge counsel has of them, which may\ninclude their group affiliations, in the context of the case to be\ntried.” Ibid . In the Court’s view, the prosecutor could\nstrike prospective jurors on the basis of their group affiliations,\nincluding race. In other words, a prosecutor could permissibly\nstrike a prospective juror for any reason, including the assumption\nor belief that a black prospective juror, because of race, would be\nfavorable to a black defendant or unfavorable to the State. See id., at 220–221. To be sure, the Swain Court held that a\ndefendant could make out a case of racial discrimination by showing\nthat the State “in case after case, whatever the circumstances,\nwhatever the crime and whoever the defendant or the victim may be,”\nhad been responsible for the removal of qualified black prospective\njurors so that no black jurors “ever serve on petit juries.” Id., at 223. But Swain ’s high bar for establishing a\nconstitutional violation was almost impossible for any defendant to\nsurmount, as the aftermath of Swain amply\ndemonstrated . Twenty-one years later, in its 1986 decision in Batson , the Court revisited several critical aspects of Swain and in essence overruled them. In so doing, the Batson Court emphasized that “the central concern” of the\nFourteenth Amendment “was to put an end to governmental\ndiscrimination on account of race.” 476 U. S., at 85. The Batson Court noted that Swain had left prosecutors’\nperemptory challenges “largely immune from constitutional\nscrutiny.” 476 U. S., at 92–93. In his concurrence in Batson , Justice Byron White (the author of Swain )\nagreed that Swain should be overruled. He stated: “[T]he\npractice of peremptorily eliminating blacks from petit juries in\ncases with black defendants remains widespread, so much so” that “I\nagree with the Court that the time has come to rule as it has.” 476\nU. S., at 101–102. Under Batson , once a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination has been shown by a defendant, the State must\nprovide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes. The trial\njudge must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated reasons were\nthe actual reasons or instead were a pretext for discrimination. Id., at 97–98. Four parts of Batson warrant particular\nemphasis here. First , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s insistence that a defendant demonstrate a history of\nracially discriminatory strikes in order to make out a claim of\nrace discrimination. See 476 U. S., at 95. According to the Batson Court, defendants had run into “practical\ndifficulties” in trying to prove that a State had systematically\n“exercised peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury on\naccount of race.” Id ., at 92, n. 17. The Batson Court\nexplained that, in some jurisdictions, requiring a defendant to\n“investigate, over a number of cases, the race of persons tried in\nthe particular jurisdiction, the racial composition of the venire\nand petit jury, and the manner in which both parties exercised\ntheir peremptory challenges” posed an “insurmountable” burden. Ibid . In addition to that practical point, the Court\nstressed a basic equal protection point: In the eyes of the\nConstitution, one racially discriminatory peremptory strike is one\ntoo many. For those reasons, the Batson Court held\nthat a criminal defendant could show “purposeful discrimination in\nselection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the\nprosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges at the\ndefendant’s trial .” Id ., at 96 (emphasis added). Second , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s statement that a prosecutor could strike a black\njuror based on an assumption or belief that the black juror would\nfavor a black defendant. In some of the most critical sentences in\nthe Batson opinion, the Court emphasized that a prosecutor\nmay not rebut a claim of discrimination “by stating merely that he\nchallenged jurors of the defendant’s race on the assumption—or his\nintuitive judgment—that they would be partial to the defendant\nbecause of their shared race.” 476 U. S., at 97. The Court\nelaborated: The Equal Protection Clause “forbids the States to\nstrike black veniremen on the assumption that they will be biased\nin a particular case simply because the defendant is black. The\ncore guarantee of equal protection, ensuring citizens that their\nState will not discriminate on account of race, would be\nmeaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors on the basis\nof such assumptions, which arise solely from the jurors’ race.” Id., at 97–98. In his concurrence, Justice Thurgood Marshall\ndrove the point home: “Exclusion of blacks from a jury, solely\nbecause of race, can no more be justified",

Mississippi certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi No. 17–9572. Argued March 20, 2019—Decided\nJune 21, 2019 Petitioner Curtis Flowers has been tried six\nseparate times for the murder of four employees of a Mississippi\nfurniture store. Flowers is black; three of the four victims were\nwhite. At the first two trials, the State used its peremptory\nstrikes on all of the qualified black prospective jurors. In each\ncase, the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death, but\nthe convictions were later reversed by the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt based on prosecutorial misconduct. At the third trial, the\nState used all of its 15 peremptory strikes against black\nprospective jurors, and the jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed again, this\ntime concluding that the State exercised its peremptory strikes on\nthe basis of race in violation of Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 . Flowers’ fourth and fifth trials ended in mistrials. At the\nfourth, the State exercised 11 peremptory strikes—all against black\nprospective jurors. No available racial information exists about\nthe prospective jurors in the fifth trial. At the sixth trial, the\nState exercised six peremptory strikes—five against black\nprospective jurors, allowing one black juror to be seated. Flowers\nagain raised a Batson claim, but the trial court concluded\nthat the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each of the\nfive peremptory strikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced\nhim to death. The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed. After this\nCourt vacated that judgment and remanded in light of Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt again upheld Flowers’ conviction in a divided 5-to-4\ndecision. Justice King dissented on the Batson issue and was\njoined by two other Justices. Held : All of the relevant facts\nand circumstances taken together establish that the trial court at\nFlowers’ sixth trial committed clear error in concluding that the\nState’s peremptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright\nwas not motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.\nPp. 7–31. (a) Under Batson , once a prima\nfacie case of discrimination has been shown by a defendant, the\nState must provide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes.\nThe trial judge then must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated\nreasons were the actual reasons or instead were a pretext for\ndiscrimination. The Batson Court rejected four arguments.\nFirst, the Batson Court rejected the idea that a defendant\nmust demonstrate a history of racially discriminatory strikes in\norder to make out a claim of race discrimination. Second, the Batson Court rejected the argument that a prosecutor could\nstrike a black juror based on an assumption or belief that the\nblack juror would favor a black defendant. Third, the Batson Court rejected the argument that race-based peremptories should be\npermissible because black, white, Asian, and Hispanic defendants\nand jurors were all “equally” subject to race-based discrimination.\nFourth, the Batson Court rejected the argument that\nrace-based peremptories are permissible because both the\nprosecution and defense could employ them in any individual case\nand in essence balance things out. Pp. 7–15. (b) Four categories of evidence loom\nlarge in assessing the Batson issue here, where the State\nhad a persistent pattern of striking black prospective jurors from\nFlowers’ first through his sixth trial. Pp. 15–30. (1) A review of the history of the\nState’s peremptory strikes in Flowers’ first four trials strongly\nsupports the conclusion that the State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial was motivated in substantial part by\ndiscriminatory intent. The State tried to strike all 36 black\nprospective jurors over the course of the first four trials. And\nthe state courts themselves concluded that the State had violated Batson on two separate occasions . The State’s\nrelentless, determined effort to rid the jury of black individuals\nstrongly suggests that the State wanted to try Flowers before a\njury with as few black jurors as possible, and ideally before an\nall-white jury. Pp. 19–22. (2) The State’s use of peremptory strikes\nin Flowers’ sixth trial followed the same pattern as the first four\ntrials. Pp. 22–23. (3) Disparate questioning can be\nprobative of discriminatory intent. Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U.S.\n322 , 331–332, 344–345. Here, the State spent far more time\nquestioning the black prospective jurors than the accepted white\njurors—145 questions asked of 5 black prospective jurors and 12\nquestions asked of 11 white seated jurors. The record refutes the\nState’s explanation that it questioned black and white prospective\njurors differently only because of differences in the jurors’\ncharacteristics. Along with the historical evidence from the\nearlier trials, as well as the State’s striking of five of six\nblack prospective jurors at the sixth trial, the dramatically\ndisparate questioning and investigation of black prospective jurors\nand white prospective jurors at the sixth trial strongly suggest\nthat the State was motivated in substantial part by a\ndiscriminatory intent. Pp. 23–26. (4) Comparing prospective jurors who were\nstruck and not struck can be an important step in determining\nwhether a Batson violation occurred. See Snyder v. Louisiana , 552 U.S.\n472 , 483–484. Here, Carolyn Wright, a black prospective juror,\nwas struck, the State says, in part because she knew several\ndefense witnesses and had worked at Wal-Mart where Flowers’ father\nalso worked. But three white prospective jurors also knew many\nindividuals involved in the case, and the State asked them no\nindividual questions about their connections to witnesses. White\nprospective jurors also had relationships with members of Flowers’\nfamily, but the State did not ask them follow-up questions in order\nto explore the depth of those relationships. The State also\nincorrectly explained that it exercised a peremptory strike against\nWright because she had worked with one of Flowers’ sisters and made\napparently incorrect statements to justify the strikes of other\nblack prospective jurors. When considered with other evidence, a\nseries of factually inaccurate explanations for striking black\nprospective jurors can be another clue showing discriminatory\nintent. The overall context here requires skepticism of the State’s\nstrike of Carolyn Wright. The trial court at Flowers’ sixth trial\ncommitted clear error in concluding that the State’s peremptory\nstrike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not motivated\nin substantial part by discriminatory intent. Pp. 26–30. 240 So. 3d 1082, reversed and remanded. Kavanaugh, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Ginsburg, Breyer, Alito,\nSotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 17–9572 _________________ CURTIS GIOVANNI FLOWERS, PETITIONER v. MISSISSIPPI on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmississippi [June 21, 2019] Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. In Batson v. Kentucky , 476 U.S.\n79 (1986), this Court ruled that a State may not discriminate\non the basis of race when exercising peremptory challenges against\nprospective jurors in a criminal trial. In 1996, Curtis Flowers allegedly murdered four\npeople in Winona, Mississippi. Flowers is black. He has been tried\nsix separate times before a jury for murder. The same lead\nprosecutor represented the State in all six trials. In the initial three trials, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed each\nconviction. In the first trial, Flowers was convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court reversed the conviction due to “numerous\ninstances of prosecutorial misconduct.” Flowers v. State , 773 So. 2d 309, 327 (2000). In the second trial, the\ntrial court found that the prosecutor discriminated on the basis of\nrace in the peremptory challenge of a black juror. The trial court\nseated the black juror. Flowers was then convicted, but the\nMississippi Supreme Court again reversed the conviction because of\nprosecutorial misconduct at trial. In the third trial, Flowers was\nconvicted, but the Mississippi Supreme Court yet again reversed the\nconviction, this time because the court concluded that the\nprosecutor had again discriminated against black prospective jurors\nin the jury selection process. The court’s lead opinion stated:\n“The instant case presents us with as strong a prima facie case of\nracial discrimination as we have ever seen in the context of a Batson challenge.” Flowers v. State , 947 So.\n2d 910, 935 (2007). The opinion further stated that the “State\nengaged in racially discriminatory practices during the jury\nselection process” and that the “case evinces an effort by the\nState to exclude African-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. The fourth and fifth trials of Flowers ended in\nmistrials due to hung juries. In his sixth trial, which is the one at issue\nhere, Flowers was convicted. The State struck five of the six black\nprospective jurors. On appeal, Flowers argued that the State again\nviolated Batson in exercising peremptory strikes against\nblack prospective jurors. In a divided 5-to-4 decision, the\nMississippi Supreme Court affirmed the conviction. We granted\ncertiorari on the Batson question and now reverse. See 586\nU. S. ___ (2018). Four critical facts, taken together, require\nreversal. First , in the six trials combined, the State\nemployed its peremptory challenges to strike 41 of the 42 black\nprospective jurors that it could have struck—a statistic that the\nState acknowledged at oral argument in this Court. Tr. of Oral Arg.\n32. Second , in the most recent trial, the sixth trial, the\nState exercised peremptory strikes against five of the six black\nprospective jurors. Third , at the sixth trial, in an\napparent effort to find pretextual reasons to strike black\nprospective jurors, the State engaged in dramatically disparate\nquestioning of black and white prospective jurors. Fourth ,\nthe State then struck at least one black prospective juror, Carolyn\nWright, who was similarly situated to white prospective jurors who\nwere not struck by the State. We need not and do not decide that any one of\nthose four facts alone would require reversal. All that we need to\ndecide, and all that we do decide, is that all of the relevant\nfacts and circumstances taken together establish that the trial\ncourt committed clear error in concluding that the State’s\nperemptory strike of black prospective juror Carolyn Wright was not\n“motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.” Foster v. Chatman , 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016)\n(slip op., at 23) (internal quotation marks omitted). In reaching\nthat conclusion, we break no new legal ground. We simply enforce\nand reinforce Batson by applying it to the extraordinary\nfacts of this case. We reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of\nMississippi, and we remand the case for further proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion. I The underlying events that gave rise to this\ncase took place in Winona, Mississippi. Winona is a small town in\nnorthern Mississippi, just off I–55 almost halfway between Jackson\nand Memphis. The total population of Winona is about 5,000. The\ntown is about 53 percent black and about 46 percent white. In 1996, Bertha Tardy, Robert Golden, Derrick\nStewart, and Carmen Rigby were murdered at the Tardy Furniture\nstore in Winona. All four victims worked at the Tardy Furniture\nstore. Three of the four victims were white; one was black. In\n1997, the State charged Curtis Flowers with murder. Flowers is\nblack. Since then, Flowers has been tried six separate times for\nthe murders. In each of the first two trials, Flowers was tried for\none individual murder. In each subsequent trial, Flowers was tried\nfor all four of the murders together. The same state prosecutor\ntried Flowers each time. The prosecutor is white. At Flowers’ first trial, 36 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 31 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nThe State exercised a total of 12 peremptory strikes, and it used 5\nof them to strike the five qualified black prospective jurors.\nFlowers objected, arguing under Batson that the State had\nexercised its peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory\nmanner. The trial court rejected the Batson challenge.\nBecause the trial court allowed the State’s peremptory strikes,\nFlowers was tried in front of an all-white jury. The jury convicted\nFlowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court\nreversed the conviction, concluding that the State had committed\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, expressing baseless grounds for doubting the credibility of\nwitnesses and mentioning facts that had not been allowed into\nevidence by the trial judge. Flowers , 773 So. 2d, at\n317, 334. In its opinion, the Mississippi Supreme Court described\n“numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct” at the trial. Id., at 327. Because the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed\nbased on prosecutorial misconduct at trial, the court did not reach\nFlowers’ Batson argument. See Flowers , 773\nSo. 2d, at 327 . At the second trial, 30 prospective jurors—5\nblack and 25 white—were presented to potentially serve on the jury.\nAs in Flowers’ first trial, the State again used its strikes\nagainst all five black prospective jurors. But this time, the trial\ncourt determined that the State’s asserted reason for one of the\nstrikes was a pretext for discrimination. Specifically, the trial\ncourt determined that one of the State’s proffered reasons—that the\njuror had been inattentive and was nodding off during jury\nselection—for striking that juror was false, and the trial court\ntherefore sustained Flowers’ Batson challenge. The trial\ncourt disallowed the strike and sat that black juror on the jury.\nThe jury at Flowers’ second trial consisted of 11 white jurors and\n1 black juror. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to\ndeath. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court again\nreversed. The court ruled that the prosecutor had again engaged in\nprosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury by, among other\nthings, impermissibly referencing evidence and attempting to\nundermine witness credibility without a factual basis. See Flowers v. State , 842 So. 2d 531, 538, 553\n(2003). At Flowers’ third trial, 45 prospective\njurors—17 black and 28 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. One of the black prospective jurors was struck for cause,\nleaving 16. The State exercised a total of 15 peremptory strikes,\nand it used all 15 against black prospective jurors. Flowers again\nargued that the State had used its peremptory strikes in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner. The trial court found that the State had not\ndiscriminated on the basis of race. See Flowers , 947\nSo. 2d, at 916. The jury in Flowers’ third trial consisted of\n11 white jurors and 1 black juror. The lone black juror who served\non the jury was seated after the State ran out of peremptory\nstrikes. The jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the Mississippi Supreme Court yet\nagain reversed, concluding that the State had again violated Batson by discriminating on the basis of race in exercising\nall 15 of its peremptory strikes against 15 black prospective\njurors. See Flowers , 947 So. 2d, at 939. The court’s\nlead opinion stated: “The instant case presents us with as strong a\nprima facie case of racial discrimination as we have ever seen in\nthe context of a Batson challenge.” Id., at 935. The\nopinion explained that although “each individual strike may have\njustifiably appeared to the trial court to be sufficiently race\nneutral, the trial court also has a duty to look at the State’s use\nof peremptory challenges in toto .” Id., at 937.\nThe opinion emphasized that “trial judges should not blindly accept\nany and every reason put forth by the State, especially” when “the\nState continues to exercise challenge after challenge only upon\nmembers of a particular race.” Ibid . The opinion added that\nthe “State engaged in racially discriminatory practices” and that\nthe “case evinces an effort by the State to exclude\nAfrican-Americans from jury service.” Id., at 937, 939. At Flowers’ fourth trial, 36 prospective\njurors—16 black and 20 white—were presented to potentially serve on\nthe jury. The State exercised a total of 11 peremptory strikes, and\nit used all 11 against black prospective jurors. But because of the\nrelatively large number of prospective jurors who were black, the\nState did not have enough peremptory challenges to eliminate all of\nthe black prospective jurors. The seated jury consisted of seven\nwhite jurors and five black jurors. That jury could not reach a\nverdict, and the proceeding ended in a mistrial. As to the fifth trial, there is no available\nracial information about the prospective jurors, as distinct from\nthe jurors who ultimately sat on the jury. The jury was composed of\nnine white jurors and three black jurors. The jury could not reach\na verdict, and the trial again ended in a mistrial. At the sixth trial, which we consider here, 26\nprospective jurors—6 black and 20 white—were presented to\npotentially serve on the jury. The State exercised a total of six\nperemptory strikes, and it used five of the six against black\nprospective jurors, leaving one black juror to sit on the jury.\nFlowers again argued that the State had exercised its peremptory\nstrikes in a racially discrimina-tory manner. The trial court\nconcluded that the State had offered race-neutral reasons for each\nof the five peremp-tory strikes against the five black prospective\njurors. The jury at Flowers’ sixth trial consisted of 11 white\njurors and 1 black juror. That jury convicted Flowers of murder and\nsentenced him to death. In a divided decision, the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt agreed with the trial court on the Batson issue and\nstated that the State’s “race-neutral reasons were valid and not\nmerely pretextual.” Flowers v. State , 158 So. 3d\n1009, 1058 (2014). Flowers then sought review in this Court. This\nCourt granted Flowers’ petition for a writ of certio-rari, vacated\nthe judgment of the Mississippi Supreme Court, and remanded for\nfurther consideration in light of the decision in Foster ,\n578 U. S. ___. Flowers v. Mississippi , 579\nU. S. ___ (2016). In Foster , this Court held that the\ndefendant Foster had established a Batson violation. 578\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 25). On remand, the Mississippi Supreme Court by a\n5-to-4 vote again upheld Flowers’ conviction. See 240 So. 3d 1082\n(2017). Justice King wrote a dissent for three justices. He stated:\n“I cannot conclude that Flowers received a fair trial, nor can I\nconclude that prospective jurors were not subjected to\nimpermissible discrimination.” Id ., at 1172. According to\nJustice King, both the trial court and the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt “completely disregard[ed] the constitutional right of\nprospective jurors to be free from a racially discriminatory\nselection process.” Id., at 1171. We granted certiorari. See\n586 U. S. ___. II A Other than voting, serving on a jury is the\nmost substantial opportunity that most citizens have to participate\nin the democratic process. See Powers v. Ohio , 499 U.S.\n400 , 407 (1991). Jury selection in criminal cases varies\nsignificantly based on state and local rules and practices, but\nordinarily consists of three phases, which we describe here in\ngeneral terms. First , a group of citizens in the community\nis randomly summoned to the courthouse on a particular day for\npotential jury service. Second , a subgroup of those\nprospective jurors is called into a particular courtroom for a\nspecific case. The prospective jurors are often questioned by the\njudge, as well as by the prosecutor and defense attorney. During\nthat second phase, the judge may excuse certain prospective jurors\nbased on their answers. Third , the prosecutor and defense\nattorney may challenge certain prospective jurors. The attorneys\nmay challenge prospective jurors for cause, which usually stems\nfrom a potential juror’s conflicts of interest or inability to be\nimpartial. In addition to challenges for cause, each side is\ntypically afforded a set number of peremptory challenges or\nstrikes. Peremptory strikes have very old credentials and can be\ntraced back to the common law. Those peremptory strikes\ntraditionally may be used to remove any potential juror for any\nreason—no questions asked. That blanket discretion to peremptorily strike\nprospective jurors for any reason can clash with the dictates of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. This case arises at the intersection of\nthe peremptory challenge and the Equal Protection Clause. And to\nunderstand how equal protection law applies to peremptory\nchallenges, it helps to begin at the beginning. Ratified in 1868 in the wake of the Civil War,\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides\nthat no State shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the\nequal protection of the laws.” A primary objective of the Equal\nProtection Clause, this Court stated just five years after\nratification, was “the freedom of the slave race, the security and\nfirm establishment of that freedom, and the protection of the\nnewly-made freeman and citizen from the oppressions of those who\nhad formerly exercised unlimited dominion over him.” Slaughter-House Cases , 16 Wall. 36, 71 (1873). In 1875, to help enforce the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Congress passed and President Ulysses S. Grant signed\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1875. Ch. 114, 18Stat. 335. Among other\nthings, that law made it a criminal offense for state officials to\nexclude individuals from jury service on account of their race. 18\nU. S. C. §243. The Act provides: “No citizen possessing\nall other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by law\nshall be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any\ncourt of the United States, or of any State on account of race,\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.” In 1880, just 12 years after ratification of the\nFourteenth Amendment, the Court decided Strauder v. West\nVirginia , 100 U.S.\n303 . That case concerned a West Virginia statute that allowed\nwhites only to serve as jurors. The Court held the law\nunconstitutional. In reaching its conclusion, the Court explained\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment required “that the law in the States\nshall be the same for the black as for the white; that all persons,\nwhether colored or white, shall stand equal before the laws of the\nStates, and, in regard to the colored race, for whose protection\nthe amendment was primarily designed, that no discrimination shall\nbe made against them by law because of their color.” Id., at\n307. In the words of the Strauder Court: “The very fact that\ncolored people are singled out and expressly denied by a statute\nall right to participate in the administration of the law, as\njurors, because of their color, though they are citizens, and may\nbe in other respects fully qualified, is practically a brand upon\nthem, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority, and a\nstimulant to that race prejudice which is an impediment to securing\nto individuals of the race that equal justice which the law aims to\nsecure to all others.” Id ., at 308. For those reasons, the\nCourt ruled that the West Virginia statute exclud- ing blacks from\njury service violated the Fourteenth Amendment. As the Court later explained in Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U.S.\n483 (1954), the Court’s decisions in the Slaughter-House\nCases and Strauder interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment\n“as proscribing all state-imposed discriminations against the Negro\nrace,” including in jury service. Brown , 347 U. S., at\n490. In the decades after Strauder , the Court\nreiterated that States may not discriminate on the basis of race in\njury selection. See, e.g., Neal v. Delaware , 103 U.S.\n370 , 397 (1881); Carter v. Texas , 177 U.S.\n442 , 447 (1900); Norris v. Alabama , 294 U.S.\n587 , 597–599 (1935); Hale v. Kentucky , 303 U.S.\n613 , 616 (1938) ( per curiam ); Pierre v. Louisiana , 306 U.S.\n354 , 362 (1939); Smith v. Texas , 311 U.S.\n128 , 130–131 (1940); Avery v. Georgia , 345 U.S.\n559 , 562 (1953); Hernandez v. Texas , 347 U.S.\n475 , 477–478, 482 (1954); Coleman v. Alabama , 377 U.S.\n129 , 133 (1964). But critical problems persisted. Even though\nlaws barring blacks from serving on juries were unconstitutional\nafter Strauder , many jurisdictions employed various\ndiscriminatory tools to prevent black persons from being called for\njury service. And when those tactics failed, or were invalidated,\nprosecutors could still exercise peremptory strikes in individual\ncases to remove most or all black prospective jurors. In the century after Strauder , the\nfreedom to exercise peremptory strikes for any reason meant that\n“the problem of racial exclusion from jury service” remained\n“widespread” and “deeply entrenched.” 5 U. S. Commission on\nCivil Rights Report 90 (1961). Simple math shows how that happened.\nGiven that blacks were a minority of the population, in many\njurisdictions the number of peremp-tory strikes available to the\nprosecutor exceeded the number of black prospective jurors. So\nprosecutors could routinely exercise peremptories to strike all the\nblack prospective jurors and thereby ensure all-white juries. The\nexclusion of black prospective jurors was almost total in certain\njurisdictions, especially in cases involving black defendants.\nSimilarly, defense counsel could use—and routinely did\nuse—peremptory challenges to strike all the black prospective\njurors in cases involving white defendants and black victims. In the aftermath of Strauder , the\nexclusion of black jurors became more covert and less overt—often\naccomplished through peremptory challenges in individual courtrooms\nrather than by blanket operation of law. But as this Court later\nnoted, the results were the same for black jurors and black\ndefendants, as well as for the black community’s confidence in the\nfairness of the American criminal justice system. See Batson , 476 U. S., at 98–99. Eighty-five years after Strauder , the\nCourt decided Swain v. Alabama , 380 U.S.\n202 (1965). The defendant Swain was black. Swain was convicted\nof a capital offense in Talladega County, Alabama, and sentenced to\ndeath. Swain presented evidence that no black juror had served on a\njury in Talladega County in more than a decade. See id . , at 226. And in Swain’s case, the prosecutor\nstruck all six qualified black prospective jurors, ensuring that\nSwain was tried before an all-white jury. Swain invoked Strauder to argue that the prosecutor in his case had\nimpermis-sibly discriminated on the basis of race by using\nperemptory challenges to strike the six black prospective jurors.\nSee 380 U. S., at 203, 210. This Court ruled that Swain had not established\nunconstitutional discrimination. Most importantly, the Court held\nthat a defendant could not object to the State’s use of peremptory\nstrikes in an individual case. In the Court’s words: “[W]e cannot\nhold that the striking of Negroes in a particular case is a denial\nof equal protection of the laws.” Id., at 221. The Swain Court reasoned that prosecutors do not always judge\nprospective jurors individually when exercising peremptory strikes.\nInstead, prosecutors choose which prospective jurors to strike “in\nlight of the limited knowledge counsel has of them, which may\ninclude their group affiliations, in the context of the case to be\ntried.” Ibid . In the Court’s view, the prosecutor could\nstrike prospective jurors on the basis of their group affiliations,\nincluding race. In other words, a prosecutor could permissibly\nstrike a prospective juror for any reason, including the assumption\nor belief that a black prospective juror, because of race, would be\nfavorable to a black defendant or unfavorable to the State. See id., at 220–221. To be sure, the Swain Court held that a\ndefendant could make out a case of racial discrimination by showing\nthat the State “in case after case, whatever the circumstances,\nwhatever the crime and whoever the defendant or the victim may be,”\nhad been responsible for the removal of qualified black prospective\njurors so that no black jurors “ever serve on petit juries.” Id., at 223. But Swain ’s high bar for establishing a\nconstitutional violation was almost impossible for any defendant to\nsurmount, as the aftermath of Swain amply\ndemonstrated . Twenty-one years later, in its 1986 decision in Batson , the Court revisited several critical aspects of Swain and in essence overruled them. In so doing, the Batson Court emphasized that “the central concern” of the\nFourteenth Amendment “was to put an end to governmental\ndiscrimination on account of race.” 476 U. S., at 85. The Batson Court noted that Swain had left prosecutors’\nperemptory challenges “largely immune from constitutional\nscrutiny.” 476 U. S., at 92–93. In his concurrence in Batson , Justice Byron White (the author of Swain )\nagreed that Swain should be overruled. He stated: “[T]he\npractice of peremptorily eliminating blacks from petit juries in\ncases with black defendants remains widespread, so much so” that “I\nagree with the Court that the time has come to rule as it has.” 476\nU. S., at 101–102. Under Batson , once a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination has been shown by a defendant, the State must\nprovide race-neutral reasons for its peremptory strikes. The trial\njudge must determine whether the prosecutor’s stated reasons were\nthe actual reasons or instead were a pretext for discrimination. Id., at 97–98. Four parts of Batson warrant particular\nemphasis here. First , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s insistence that a defendant demonstrate a history of\nracially discriminatory strikes in order to make out a claim of\nrace discrimination. See 476 U. S., at 95. According to the Batson Court, defendants had run into “practical\ndifficulties” in trying to prove that a State had systematically\n“exercised peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from the jury on\naccount of race.” Id ., at 92, n. 17. The Batson Court\nexplained that, in some jurisdictions, requiring a defendant to\n“investigate, over a number of cases, the race of persons tried in\nthe particular jurisdiction, the racial composition of the venire\nand petit jury, and the manner in which both parties exercised\ntheir peremptory challenges” posed an “insurmountable” burden. Ibid . In addition to that practical point, the Court\nstressed a basic equal protection point: In the eyes of the\nConstitution, one racially discriminatory peremptory strike is one\ntoo many. For those reasons, the Batson Court held\nthat a criminal defendant could show “purposeful discrimination in\nselection of the petit jury solely on evidence concerning the\nprosecutor’s exercise of peremptory challenges at the\ndefendant’s trial .” Id ., at 96 (emphasis added). Second , the Batson Court rejected Swain ’s statement that a prosecutor could strike a black\njuror based on an assumption or belief that the black juror would\nfavor a black defendant. In some of the most critical sentences in\nthe Batson opinion, the Court emphasized that a prosecutor\nmay not rebut a claim of discrimination “by stating merely that he\nchallenged jurors of the defendant’s race on the assumption—or his\nintuitive judgment—that they would be partial to the defendant\nbecause of their shared race.” 476 U. S., at 97. The Court\nelaborated: The Equal Protection Clause “forbids the States to\nstrike black veniremen on the assumption that they will be biased\nin a particular case simply because the defendant is black. The\ncore guarantee of equal protection, ensuring citizens that their\nState will not discriminate on account of race, would be\nmeaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors on the basis\nof such assumptions, which arise solely from the jurors’ race.” Id., at 97–98. In his concurrence, Justice Thurgood Marshall\ndrove the point home: “Exclusion of blacks from a jury, solely\nbecause of race, can no more be justified",

American\nHumanist Assn. et al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit No. 17–1717. Argued February 27, 2019—Decided\nJune 20, 2019[ 1 ] In 1918, residents of Prince George’s County,\nMaryland, formed a committee for the purpose of erecting a memorial\nfor the county’s soldiers who fell in World War I. The committee\ndecided that the memorial should be a cross, which was not\nsurprising since the plain Latin cross had become a central symbol\nof the war. The image of row after row of plain white crosses\nmarking the overseas graves of soldiers was emblazoned on the minds\nof Americans at home. The memorial would stand at the terminus of\nanother World War I memorial—the National Defense Highway\nconnecting Washington to Annapolis. When the committee ran out of\nfunds, the local American Legion took over the project, completing\nthe memorial in 1925. The 32-foot tall Latin cross displays the\nAmerican Legion’s emblem at its center and sits on a large pedestal\nbearing, inter alia , a bronze plaque that lists the names of\nthe 49 county soldiers who had fallen in the war. At the dedication\nceremony, a Catholic priest offered an invocation and a Baptist\npastor offered a benediction. The Bladensburg Cross (Cross) has\nsince been the site of patriotic events honoring veterans on, e.g., Veterans Day, Memorial Day, and Independence Day.\nMonuments honoring the veterans of other conflicts have been added\nin a park near the Cross. As the area around the Cross developed,\nthe monument came to be at the center of a busy intersection. In\n1961, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission\n(Commission) acquired the Cross and the land where it sits, but the\nAmerican Legion reserved the right to continue using the site for\nceremonies. The Commission has used public funds to maintain the\nmonument ever since. In 2014, the American Humanist Association\n(AHA) and others filed suit in District Court, alleging that the\nCross’s presence on public land and the Commission’s maintenance of\nthe memorial violate the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause.\nThe American Legion intervened to defend the Cross. The District\nCourt granted summary judgment for the Commission and the American\nLegion, concluding that the Cross satisfies both the test announced\nin Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S.\n602 , and the analysis applied by Justice Breyer in upholding a\nTen Commandments monument in Van Orden v. Perry , 545 U.S.\n677 . The Fourth Circuit reversed. Held : The judgment is reversed and\nremanded. 874 F.3d 195, reversed and remanded. Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the\nCourt with respect to Parts I, II–B, II–C, III, and IV, concluding\nthat the Bladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment\nClause. Pp. 16–24, 28–31. (a) At least four considerations show\nthat retaining established, religiously expressive monuments,\nsymbols, and practices is quite different from erecting or adopting\nnew ones. First , these cases often concern monuments,\nsymbols, or practices that were first established long ago, and\nthus, identifying their original purpose or purposes may be\nespecially difficult. See Salazar v. Buono , 559 U.S.\n700 . Second , as time goes by, the purposes associated\nwith an established monument, symbol, or practice often multiply,\nas in the Ten Commandments monuments addressed in Van Orden and McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of\nKy. , 545 U.S.\n844 . Even if the monument’s original purpose was infused with\nreligion, the passage of time may obscure that sentiment and the\nmonument may be retained for the sake of its historical\nsignificance or its place in a common cultural heritage. Third, the message of a monument, symbol, or practice may\nevolve, Pleasant Grove City v. Summum , 555 U.S.\n460 , 477, as is the case with a city name like Bethlehem,\nPennsylvania; Arizona’s motto “Ditat Deus” (“God enriches”),\nadopted in 1864; or Maryland’s flag, which has included two crosses\nsince 1904. Familiarity itself can become a reason for\npreservation. Fourth , when time’s passage imbues a\nreligiously expressive monument, symbol, or practice with this kind\nof familiarity and historical significance, removing it may no\nlonger appear neutral, especially to the local community. The\npassage of time thus gives rise to a strong presumption of\nconstitutionality. Pp. 16–21. (b) The cross is a symbol closely linked\nto World War I. The United States adopted it as part of its\nmilitary honors, establishing the Distinguished Service Cross and\nthe Navy Cross in 1918 and 1919, respectively. And the fallen\nsoldiers’ final resting places abroad were marked by white crosses\nor Stars of David, a solemn image that became inextricably linked\nwith and symbolic of the ultimate price paid by 116,000 soldiers.\nThis relationship between the cross and the war may not have been\nthe sole or dominant motivation for the design of the many war\nmemorials that sprang up across the Nation, but that is all but\nimpossible to determine today. The passage of time means that\ntestimony from the decisionmakers may not be available. And\nregardless of the original purposes for erecting the monument, a\ncommunity may wish to preserve it for very different reasons, such\nas the historic preservation and traffic-safety concerns noted\nhere. The area surrounding a monument like the Bladensburg Cross\nmay also have been altered in ways that change its meaning and\nprovide new reasons for its preservation. Even the AHA recognizes\nthat the monument’s surroundings are important, as it concedes that\nthe presence of a cross monument in a cemetery is unobjectionable.\nBut a memorial’s placement in a cemetery is not necessary to create\nthe connection to those it honors. Memorials took the place of\ngravestones for those parents and other relatives who lacked the\nmeans to travel to Europe to visit the graves of their war dead and\nfor those soldiers whose bodies were never recovered. Similarly,\nmemorials and monuments honoring important historical figures e.g., Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., often include a symbol of\nthe faith that was important to the persons whose lives are\ncommemorated. Finally, as World War I monuments have endured\nthrough the years and become a familiar part of the physical and\ncultural landscape, requiring their removal or alteration would not\nbe viewed by many as a neutral act. Few would say that California\nis attempting to convey a religious message by retaining the many\ncity names, like Los Angeles and San Diego, given by the original\nSpanish settlers. But it would be something else entirely if the\nState undertook to change those names. Much the same is true about\nmonuments to soldiers who sacrificed their lives for this country\nmore than a century ago. Pp. 21–24. (c) Applying these principles here, the\nBladensburg Cross does not violate the Establishment Clause. The\nimage of the simple wooden cross that originally marked the graves\nof American soldiers killed in World War I became a symbol of their\nsacrifice, and the design of the Bladensburg Cross must be\nunderstood in light of that background. That the cross originated\nas a Christian symbol and retains that meaning in many contexts\ndoes not change the fact that the symbol took on an added secular\nmeaning when used in World War I memorials. The Cross has also\nacquired historical importance with the passage of time, reminding\nthe townspeople of the deeds and sacrifices of their predecessors\nas it stands among memorials to veterans of later wars. It has thus\nbecome part of the community. It would not serve that role had its\ndesign deliberately disrespected area soldiers, but there is no\nevidence that the names of any area Jewish soldiers were either\nintentionally left off the memorial’s list or included against the\nwishes of their families. The AHA tries to connect the Cross and\nthe American Legion with anti-Semitism and the Ku Klux Klan, but\nthe monument, which was dedicated during a period of heightened\nracial and religious animosity, includes the names of both Black\nand White soldiers; and both Catholic and Baptist clergy\nparticipated in the dedication. It is also natural and appropriate\nfor a monument commemorating the death of particular individuals to\ninvoke the symbols that signify what death meant for those who are\nmemorialized. Excluding those symbols could make the memorial seem\nincomplete. This explains why Holocaust memorials invariably\nfeature a Star of David or other symbols of Judaism and why the\nmemorial at issue features the same symbol that marks the graves of\nso many soldiers near the battlefields where they fell.\nPp. 28–30. (d) The fact that the cross is\nundoubtedly a Christian symbol should not blind one to everything\nelse that the Bladensburg Cross has come to represent: a symbolic\nresting place for ancestors who never returned home, a place for\nthe community to gather and honor all veterans and their sacrifices\nfor this Nation, and a historical landmark. For many, destroying or\ndefacing the Cross would not be neutral and would not further the\nideals of respect and tolerance embodied in the First Amendment.\nP. 31. Justice Alito, joined by The Chief Justice,\nJustice Breyer, and Justice Kavanaugh, concluded in Parts II–A and\nII–D: (a) Lemon ambitiously attempted to\nfashion a test for all Establishment Clause cases. The test called\non courts to examine the purposes and effects of a challenged\ngovernment action, as well as any entanglement with religion that\nit might entail. The expectation of a ready framework has not been\nmet, and the Court has many times either expressly declined to\napply the test or simply ignored it. See, e.g., Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist. , 509 U.S.\n1 ; Town of Greece v. Galloway , 572 U.S. 565.\nPp. 12–16. (b) The Lemon Court ambitiously\nattempted to find a grand unified theory of the Establishment\nClause, but the Court has since taken a more modest approach that\nfocuses on the particular issue at hand and looks to history for\nguidance. The cases involving prayer before legislative sessions\nare illustrative. In Marsh v. Chambers , 463 U.S.\n783 , the Court upheld a State Legislature’s practice of\nbeginning each session with a prayer by an official chaplain,\nfinding it highly persuasive that Congress for over 200 years had\nopened its sessions with a prayer and that many state legislatures\nhad followed suit. And the Court in Town of Greece reasoned\nthat the historical practice of having, since the First Congress,\nchaplains in Congress showed “that the Framers considered\nlegislative prayer a benign acknowledgment of religion’s role in\nsociety.” 572 U. S., at 576. Where monuments, symbols, and\npractices with a longstanding history follow in the tradition of\nthe First Congress in respecting and tolerating different views,\nendeavoring to achieve inclusivity and nondiscrimination, and\nrecognizing the important role religion plays in the lives of many\nAmericans, they are likewise constitutional. Pp. 24–28. Justice Thomas, agreeing that the Bladensburg\nCross is constitutional, concluded: (a) The text and history of the\nClause—which reads “Congress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion”—suggest that it should not be\nincorporated against the States. When the Court incorporated the\nClause in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U.S.\n1 , 15, it apparently did not consider that an incorporated\nEstablishment Clause would prohibit exactly what the text of the\nClause seeks to protect: state establishments of religion. The\nappropriate question is whether any longstanding right of\ncitizenship restrains the States in the establishment context.\nFurther confounding the incorporation question is the fact that the\nFirst Amendment by its terms applies only to “law[s]” enacted by\n“Congress.” Pp. 1–3. (b) Even if the Clause applied to state\nand local governments in some fashion, “[t]he mere presence of the\nmonument along [respondents’] path involves no [actual legal]\ncoercion,” the sine qua non of an establishment of religion. Van Orden v. Perry , 545 U.S.\n677 , 694 (opinion of Thomas, J.). The plaintiff claiming an\nunconstitutional establishment of religion must demonstrate that he\nwas actually coerced by government conduct that shares the\ncharacteristics of an establishment as understood at the founding.\nRespondents have not demonstrated that maintaining a religious\ndisplay on public property shares any of the historical\ncharacteristics of an establishment of religion. Town of\nGreece v. Galloway , 572 U.S. 565, 608 (same). The\nBladensburg Cross is constitutional even though the cross has\nreligious significance. Religious displays or speech need not be\nlimited to those considered nonsectarian. Insisting otherwise is\ninconsistent with this Nation’s history and traditions, id., at 578–580 (majority opinion), and would force the courts “to act\nas supervisors and censors of religious speech,” id., at\n581. Pp. 3–5. (c) The plurality rightly rejects the\nrelevance of the test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.S.\n602 , 612–613, to claims like this one, which involve\nreligiously expressive monuments, symbols, displays, and similar\npractices, but Justice Thomas would take the logical next step and\noverrule the Lemon test in all contexts. The test has no\nbasis in the original meaning of the Constitution; it has “been\nmanipulated to fit whatever result the Court aimed to achieve,” McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of\nKy. , 545 U.S.\n844 , 900 (Scalia, J., dissenting); and it continues to cause\nenormous confusion in the States and the lower courts.\nPp. 6–7. Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Thomas,\nconcludes that a suit like this one should be dismissed for lack of\nstanding. Pp. 1–11. (a) The American Humanist Association\nclaims that its members come into regular, unwelcome contact with\nthe Bladensburg Cross when they drive through the area, but this\n“offended observer” theory of standing has no basis in law. To\nestablish standing to sue consistent with the Constitution, a\nplaintiff must show: (1) injury-in-fact, (2) causation, and (3)\nredressability. And the injury-in-fact must be “concrete and\nparticularized.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S.\n555 , 560. This Court has already rejected the notion that\noffense alone qualifies as a “concrete and particularized” injury\nsufficient to confer standing, Diamond v. Charles , 476 U.S.\n54 , 62, and it has done so in the context of the Establishment\nClause itself, see Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for the Separation of Church and State , 454 U.S.\n464 . Offended observer standing is deeply inconsistent, too,\nwith many other longstanding principles and precedents, including\nthe rule that “ ‘generalized grievances’ about the conduct of\nGovernment” are insufficient to confer standing to sue, Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War , 418 U.S.\n208 , 217, and “the rule that a party ‘generally must assert his\nown legal rights and interests,’ ” not those “ ‘of third\nparties,’ ” Kowalski v. Tesmer , 543 U.S.\n125 , 129. Pp. 1–6. (b) Lower courts invented offended\nobserver standing for Establishment Clause cases in response to Lemon v. Kurtzman , 403 U.S.\n602 , reasoning that if the Establishment Clause forbids\nanything that a reasonable observer would view as an endorsement of\nreligion, then such an observer must be able to sue. Lemon ,\nhowever, was a misadventure, and the Court today relies on a more\nmodest, historically sensitive approach, interpreting the\nEstablishment Clause with reference to historical practices and\nunderstandings. The monument here is clearly constitutional in\nlight of the nation’s traditions. Al- though the plurality does not\nsay it in as many words, the message of today’s decision for the\nlower courts must be this: whether a monument, symbol, or practice\nis old or new, apply Town of Greece v. Galloway , 572\nU.S. 565, not Lemon , because what matters when it comes to\nassessing a monument, symbol, or practice is not its age but its\ncompliance with ageless principles. Pp. 6–9. (c) With Lemon now shelved, little\nexcuse will remain for the anomaly of offended observer standing,\nand the gaping hole it tore in standing doctrine in the courts of\nappeals should now begin to close. Abandoning offended observer\nstanding will mean only a return to the usual demands of Article\nIII, requiring a real controversy with real impact on real persons\nto make a federal case out of it. Pp. 9–11. Alito, J., announced the judgment of the Court\nand delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I,\nII–B, II–C, III, and IV, in which Roberts, C. J., and Breyer,\nKagan, and Kavanaugh, JJ., joined, and an opinion with respect to\nParts II–A and II–D, in which Roberts, C. J., and Breyer and\nKavanaugh, JJ., joined.

AMERICAN HUMANIST ASSOCIATION,\net al. on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fourth circuit [June 20, 2019] Justice Alito announced the judgment of the\nCourt and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts\nI, II–B, II–C, III, and IV, and an opinion with respect to Parts\nII–A and II–D, in which The Chief Justice, Justice Breyer, and\nJustice Kavanaugh join. Since 1925, the Bladensburg Peace Cross (Cross)\nhas stood as a tribute to 49 area soldiers who gave their lives in\nthe First World War. Eighty-nine years after the dedication of the\nCross, respondents filed this lawsuit, claiming that they are\noffended by the sight of the memorial on public land and that its\npresence there and the expenditure of public funds to maintain it\nviolate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. To remedy\nthis violation, they asked a federal court to order the relocation\nor demolition of the Cross or at least the removal of its arms. The\nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed that the memorial is\nunconstitutional and remanded for a determination of the proper\nremedy. We now reverse. Although the cross has long been a preeminent\nChristian symbol, its use in the Bladensburg memorial has a special\nsignificance. After the First World War, the picture of row after\nrow of plain white crosses marking the overseas graves of soldiers\nwho had lost their lives in that horrible conflict was emblazoned\non the minds of Americans at home, and the adoption of the cross as\nthe Bladensburg memorial must be viewed in that historical context.\nFor nearly a century, the Bladensburg Cross has expressed the\ncommunity’s grief at the loss of the young men who perished, its\nthanks for their sacrifice, and its dedication to the ideals for\nwhich they fought. It has become a prominent community landmark,\nand its removal or radical alteration at this date would be seen by\nmany not as a neutral act but as the manifestation of “a hostility\ntoward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause\ntraditions.” Van Orden v. Perry , 545\nU.S. 677 , 704 (2005) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). And\ncon- trary to respondents’ intimations, there is no evidence of\ndiscriminatory intent in the selection of the design of the\nmemorial or the decision of a Maryland commission to maintain it.\nThe Religion Clauses of the Constitution aim to foster a society in\nwhich people of all beliefs can live together harmoniously, and the\npresence of the Bladensburg Cross on the land where it has stood\nfor so many years is fully consistent with that aim. I A The cross came into widespread use as a symbol\nof Christianity by the fourth century,[ 1 ] and it retains that meaning today. But there are many\ncontexts in which the symbol has also taken on a secular meaning.\nIndeed, there are instances in which its message is now almost\nentirely secular. A cross appears as part of many registered\ntrademarks held by businesses and secular organizations, including\nBlue Cross Blue Shield, the Bayer Group, and some Johnson &\nJohnson products.[ 2 ] Many of\nthese marks relate to health care, and it is likely that the\nassociation of the cross with healing had a religious origin. But\nthe current use of these marks is indisputably secular. The familiar symbol of the Red Cross—a red cross\non a white background—shows how the meaning of a symbol that was\noriginally religious can be transformed. The International\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) selected that symbol in 1863\nbecause it was thought to call to mind the flag of Switzerland, a\ncountry widely known for its neutrality.[ 3 ] The Swiss flag consists of a white cross on a red\nbackground. In an effort to invoke the message associated with that\nflag, the ICRC copied its design with the colors inverted. Thus,\nthe ICRC selected this symbol for an essentially secular reason,\nand the current secular message of the symbol is shown by its use\ntoday in nations with only tiny Christian populations.[ 4 ] But the cross was originally chosen\nfor the Swiss flag for religious reasons.[ 5 ] So an image that began as an expression of faith was\ntransformed. The image used in the Bladensburg memorial—a\nplain Latin cross[ 6 ]—also took\non new meaning after World War I. “During and immediately after the\nwar, the army marked soldiers’ graves with temporary wooden crosses\nor Stars of David”—a departure from the prior practice of marking\ngraves in American military cemeteries with uniform rectangular\nslabs. G. Piehler, Remembering War the American Way 101 (1995);\nApp. 1146. The vast majority of these grave markers consisted of\ncrosses,[ 7 ] and thus when\nAmericans saw photographs of these cemeteries, what struck them\nwere rows and rows of plain white crosses. As a result, the image\nof a simple white cross “developed into a ‘central symbol’ ”\nof the conflict. Ibid . Contemporary literature, poetry, and\nart reflected this powerful imagery. See Brief for Veterans of\nForeign Wars of the United States et al. as Amici\nCuriae 10–16. Perhaps most famously, John McCrae’s poem, In\nFlanders Fields, began with these memorable lines: “In Flanders fields the poppies blow Between the crosses, row on row.” In Flanders Fields and Other Poems 3 (G. P.\nPutnam’s Sons ed. 1919). The poem was enormously popular. See P.\nFussell, The Great War and Modern Memory 248–249 (1975). A 1921 New\nYork Times article quoted a description of McCrae’s composition as\n“ ‘the poem of the army’ ” and “ ‘of all those who\nunderstand the meaning of the great conflict.’ ”[ 8 ] The image of “the crosses, row on row,”\nstuck in people’s minds, and even today for those who view World\nWar I cemeteries in Europe, the image is arresting.[ 9 ] After the 1918 armistice, the War Department\nannounced plans to replace the wooden crosses and Stars of David\nwith uniform marble slabs like those previously used in American\nmilitary cemeteries. App. 1146. But the public outcry against that\nproposal was swift and fierce. Many organizations, including the\nAmerican War Mothers, a nonsectarian group founded in 1917, urged\nthe Department to retain the design of the temporary markers. Id. , at 1146–1147. When the American Battle Monuments\nCommission took over the project of designing the headstones, it\nresponded to this public sentiment by opting to replace the wooden\ncrosses and Stars of David with marble versions of those symbols. Id. , at 1144. A Member of Congress likewise introduced a\nresolution noting that “these wooden symbols have, during and since\nthe World War, been regarded as emblematic of the great sacrifices\nwhich that war entailed, have been so treated by poets and artists\nand have become peculiarly and inseparably associated in the\nthought of surviving relatives and comrades and of the Nation with\nthese World War graves.” H. Res. 15, 68th Cong., 1 (1924), App.\n1163–1164. This national debate and its outcome confirmed the\ncross’s widespread resonance as a symbol of sacrifice in the\nwar. B Recognition of the cross’s symbolism extended\nto local communities across the country. In late 1918, residents of\nPrince George’s County, Maryland, formed a committee for the\npurpose of erecting a memorial for the county’s fallen soldiers.\nApp. 988–989, 1014. Among the committee’s members were the mothers\nof 10 deceased soldiers. Id., at 989. The committee decided\nthat the memorial should be a cross and hired sculptor and\narchitect John Joseph Earley to design it. Although we do not know\nprecisely why the committee chose the cross, it is unsurprising\nthat the committee—and many others commemorating World War\nI[ 10 ]—adopted a symbol so\nwidely associated with that wrenching event. After selecting the design, the committee turned\nto the task of financing the project. The committee held\nfundraising events in the community and invited donations, no\nmatter the size, with a form that read: “We, the citizens of Maryland, trusting in\nGod, the Supreme Ruler of the Universe, Pledge Faith in our\nBrothers who gave their all in the World War to make [the] World\nSafe for Democracy. Their Mortal Bodies have turned to dust, but\ntheir spirit Lives to guide us through Life in the way of\nGodliness, Justice and Liberty. “With our Motto, ‘One God, One Country, and One\nFlag’ We contribute to this Memorial Cross Commemorating the Memory\nof those who have not Died in Vain.” Id ., at. 1251. Many of those who responded were local residents\nwho gave small amounts: Donations of 25 cents to 1 dollar were the\nmost common. Id. , at 1014. Local businesses and political\nleaders assisted in this effort. Id., at 1014, 1243. In\nwriting to thank United States Senator John Walter Smith for his\ndonation, committee treasurer Mrs. Martin Redman explained that\n“[t]he chief reason I feel as deeply in this matter [is that], my\nson, [Wm.] F. Redman, lost his life in France and because of that I\nfeel that our memorial cross is, in a way, his grave stone.” Id. , at 1244. The Cross was to stand at the terminus of\nanother World War I memorial—the National Defense Highway, which\nconnects Washington to Annapolis. The community gathered for a\njoint groundbreaking ceremony for both memorials on September 28,\n1919; the mother of the first Prince George’s County resident\nkilled in France broke ground for the Cross. Id. , at 910. By\n1922, however, the committee had run out of funds, and progress on\nthe Cross had stalled. The local post of the American Legion took\nover the project, and the monument was finished in 1925. The completed monument is a 32-foot tall Latin\ncross that sits on a large pedestal. The American Legion’s emblem\nis displayed at its center, and the words “Valor,” “Endurance,”\n“Courage,” and “Devotion” are inscribed at its base, one on each of\nthe four faces. The pedestal also features a 9- by 2.5-foot bronze\nplaque explaining that the monument is “Dedicated to the heroes of\nPrince George’s County, Maryland who lost their lives in the Great\nWar for the liberty of the world.” Id ., at 915\n(capitalization omitted). The plaque lists the names of 49 local\nmen, both Black and White, who died in the war. It identifies the\ndates of American involvement, and quotes President Woodrow\nWilson’s request for a declaration of war: “The right is more\nprecious than peace. We shall fight for the things we have always\ncarried nearest our hearts. To such a task we dedicate our lives.” Ibid . At the dedication ceremony, a local Catholic\npriest offered an invocation. Id., at 217–218. United States\nRepresentative Stephen W. Gambrill delivered the keynote address,\nhonoring the “ ‘men of Prince George’s County’ ” who\n“ ‘fought for the sacred right of all to live in peace and\nsecurity.’ ” Id ., at 1372. He encouraged the commu-\nnity to look to the “ ‘token of this cross, symbolic of\nCalvary,’ ” to “ ‘keep fresh the memory of our boys who\ndied for a righteous cause.’ ” Ibid. The ceremony\nclosed with a benediction offered by a Baptist pastor. Since its dedication, the Cross has served as\nthe site of patriotic events honoring veterans, including\ngatherings on Veterans Day, Memorial Day, and Independence Day.\nLike the dedication itself, these events have typically included an\ninvocation, a keynote speaker, and a benediction. Id. , at\n182, 319–323. Over the years, memorials honoring the veterans of\nother conflicts have been added to the surrounding area, which is\nnow known as Veterans Memorial Park. These include a World War II\nHonor Scroll; a Pearl Harbor memorial; a Korea-Vietnam veterans\nmemorial; a September 11 garden; a War of 1812 memorial; and two\nrecently added 38-foot-tall markers depicting British and American\nsoldiers in the Battle of Bladensburg. Id. , at 891–903,\n1530. Because the Cross is located on a traffic island with limited\nspace, the closest of these other monuments is about 200 feet away\nin a park across the road. Id. , at 36, 44. As the area around the Cross developed, the\nmonument came to be at the center of a busy intersection. In 1961,\nthe Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission\n(Commission) acquired the Cross and the land on which it sits in\norder to preserve the monument and address traffic-safety\nconcerns.[ 11 ] Id. , at\n420–421, 1384–1387. The American Legion reserved the right to\ncontinue using the memorial to host a variety of ceremonies,\nincluding events in memory of departed veterans. Id. , at\n1387. Over the next five decades, the Commission spent\napproximately $117,000 to maintain and preserve the monument. In\n2008, it budgeted an additional $100,000 for renovations and\nrepairs to the Cross.[ 12 ] C In 2012, nearly 90 years after the Cross was\ndedicated and more than 50 years after the Commission acquired it,\nthe American Humanist Association (AHA) lodged a complaint with the\nCommission. The complaint alleged that the Cross’s presence on\npublic land and the Commission’s maintenance of the memorial\nviolate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Id., at 1443–1451. The AHA, along with three residents of\nWashington, D. C., and Maryland, also sued the Commission in\nthe District Court for the District of Maryland, making the same\nclaim. The AHA sought declaratory and injunctive relief requiring\n“removal or demolition of the Cross, or removal of the arms from\nthe Cross to form a non-religious slab or obelisk.” 874 F.3d 195,\n202, n. 7 (CA4 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\nAmerican Legion intervened to defend the Cross. The District Court granted summary judgment for\nthe Commission and the American Legion. The Cross, the District\nCourt held, satisfies both the three-pronged test announced in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S.\n602 (1971) , and the analysis applied by Justice Breyer\nin upholding the Ten Commandments monument at issue in Van\nOrden v. Perry , 545\nU.S. 677 . Under the Lemon test, a court must ask whether\na challenged government action (1) has a secular purpose; (2) has a\n“principal or primary effect” that “neither advances nor inhibits\nreligion”; and (3) does not foster “an excessive government\nentanglement with religion,” 403 U. S., at 612–613 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Applying that test, the District Court\ndetermined that the Commission had secular purposes for acquiring\nand maintaining the Cross—namely, to commemorate World War I and to\nensure traffic safety. The court also found that a reasonable\nobserver aware of the Cross’s history, setting, and secular\nelements “would not view the Monument as having the effect of\nimpermissibly endorsing religion.” 147 F. Supp. 3d 373, 387\n(Md. 2015). Nor, according to the court, did the Commission’s\nmaintenance of the memorial create the kind of “continued and\nrepeated government involvement with religion” that would\nconstitute an excessive entanglement.

    "fulltext": " SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES BOBBY JAMES MOORE v . TEXAS on petition for writ of certiorari to the\ncourt of criminal appeals of texas No. 18–443. Decided February 19, 2019 Per Curiam. In 2015, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\nheld that petitioner, Bobby James Moore, did not have\nintellectual disability and consequently was eligible for the death\npenalty. Ex parte Moore , 470 S.W.3d 481, 527–528\n( Ex parte Moore I ). We previously considered the\nlawfulness of that determination, vacated the appeals court’s\ndecision, and remanded the case for further consideration of the\nissue. Moore v. Texas , 581 U. S. ___, ___ (2017)\n(slip op., at 18). The appeals court subsequently reconsidered the\nmatter but reached the same conclusion. Ex parte Moore ,\n548 S.W.3d 552, 573 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018) ( Ex parte Moore\nII ). We again review its decision, and we reverse its\ndetermination. I When we first heard this case, in Moore , we noted that the state trial court (a state habeas\ncourt) “received affidavits and heard testimony from Moore’s family\nmembers, former counsel, and a number of court-appointed\nmental-health experts.” 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3). We\ndescribed the evidence as “reveal[ing]” the following: “Moore had significant mental and social\ndifficulties beginning at an early age. At 13, Moore lacked basic\nunderstanding of the days of the week, the months of the year, and\nthe seasons; he could scarcely tell time or comprehend the\nstandards of measure or the basic principle that subtraction is the\nreverse of addition. At school, because of his limited ability to\nread and write, Moore could not keep up with lessons. Often, he was\nseparated from the rest of the class and told to draw pictures.\nMoore’s father, teachers, and peers called him ‘stupid’ for his\nslow reading and speech. After failing every subject in the ninth\ngrade, Moore dropped out of high school. Cast out of his home, he\nsurvived on the streets, eating from trash cans, even after two\nbouts of food poisoning.” Ibid . (citations omitted). On the basis of this and other evidence, the\ntrial court found that Moore had intellectual disability and thus\nwas ineligible for the death penalty under Atkins v. Virginia , 536 U.S.\n304 (2002). App. to Pet. for Cert. 310a–311a. The Texas Court\nof Criminal Appeals reversed that determination, Ex parte\nMoore I , 470 S.W.3d 481, and we reviewed its decision, Moore , 581 U. S. ___. At the outset of our opinion, we recognized as\nvalid the three underlying legal criteria that both the trial court\nand appeals court had applied. Id ., at ___–___ (slip op., at\n3–4) (citing American Association on Intellectual and Developmental\nDisabilities, Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification,\nand Systems of Supports (11th ed. 2010) (AAIDD–11); American\nPsychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders (5th ed. 2013) (DSM–5)). To make a finding of\nintellectual disability, a court must see: (1) deficits in\nintellectual functioning—primarily a test-related criterion, see\nDSM–5, at 37; (2) adaptive deficits, “assessed using both clinical\nevaluation and individualized . . . measures,” ibid .; and (3) the onset of these deficits while the\ndefendant was still a minor, id ., at 38. With respect to the\nfirst criterion, we wrote that Moore’s intellectual testing\nindicated his was a borderline case, but that he had demonstrated\nsufficient intellectual-functioning deficits to require\nconsideration of the second criterion—adaptive functioning. Moore , 581 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 10–12). With\nrespect to the third criterion, we found general agreement that any\nonset took place when Moore was a minor. Id ., at ___,\nn. 3 (slip op., at 4, n. 3). But there was significant disagreement between\nthe state courts about whether Moore had the adaptive deficits\nneeded for intellectual disability. “In determining the\nsignificance of adaptive deficits, clinicians look to whether an\nindividual’s adaptive performance falls two or more standard\ndeviations below the mean in any of the three adaptive skill sets\n(conceptual, social, and practical).” Id ., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 4) (citing AAIDD–11, at 43). Based on the evidence before it,\nthe trial court found that “Moore’s performance fell roughly two\nstandard deviations below the mean in all three skill\ncategories.” 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4); see App. to\nPet. for Cert. 309a. Reversing that decision, the appeals court\nheld that Moore had “not proven by a preponderance of the evidence”\nthat he possessed the requisite adaptive deficits, and thus was\neligible for the death penalty. Ex parte Moore I , 470\nS. W. 3d, at 520. We disagreed with the appeals court’s\nadaptive-functioning analysis, however, and identified at least\nfive errors. First, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\n“overemphasized Moore’s perceived adaptive strengths.” Moore , 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). “But the\nmedical community,” we said, “focuses the adaptive-functioning\ninquiry on adaptive deficits . ” Ibid . Second, the appeals court “stressed Moore’s\nimproved behavior in prison.” Id ., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\nBut “[c]linicians . . . caution against reliance on\nadaptive strengths developed ‘in a controlled setting,’ as a prison\nsurely is.” Ibid . (quoting DSM–5, at 38). Third, the appeals court “concluded that Moore’s\nrecord of academic failure, . . . childhood abuse[,] and\nsuffering  . . . detracted from a determination that\nhis intellectual and adaptive deficits were related.” 581\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13). But “in the medical\ncommunity,” those “traumatic experiences” are considered\n“ ‘ risk factors ’ for intellectual disability.” Ibid . (quoting AAIDD–11, at 59–60). Fourth, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\nrequired “Moore to show that his adaptive deficits were not related\nto ‘a personality disorder.’ ” 581 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 14) (quoting Ex parte Moore I , 470 S. W. 3d, at\n488). But clinicians recognize that the “existence of a personality\ndisorder or mental-health issue . . . is ‘not evidence\nthat a person does not also have intellectual disability.’ ”\n581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Brief for\nAmerican Psychological Association et al. as Amici\nCuriae in Moore v. Texas , O. T. 2016, No. 15–797,\np. 19). Fifth, the appeals court directed state courts,\nwhen examining adaptive deficits, to rely upon certain factors set\nforth in a Texas case called Ex parte Briseno , 135 S.W.3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). Ex parte Moore\nI , 470 S. W. 3d, at 486, 489. The Briseno factors were:\nwhether “those who knew the person best during the developmental\nstage” thought of him as “mentally retarded”; whether he could\n“formulat[e] plans” and “car[ry] them through”; whether his conduct\nshowed “leadership”; whether he showed a “rational and appropriate”\n“response to external stimuli”; whether he could answer questions\n“coherently” and “rationally”; whether he could “hide facts or lie\neffectively”; and whether the commission of his offense required\n“forethought, planning, and complex execution of purpose.” 135\nS. W. 3d, at 8–9. We criticized the use of these factors both\nbecause they had no grounding in prevailing medical practice, and\nbecause they invited “lay perceptions of intellectual dis-ability”\nand “lay stereotypes” to guide assessment of intellectual\ndisability. Moore , 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).\nEmphasizing the Briseno factors over clinical factors, we\nsaid, “ ‘creat[es] an unacceptable risk that persons with\nintellectual disability will be executed.’ ” 581 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Hall v. Florida ,\n572 U.S. 701, 704 (2014)). While our decisions in “ Atkins and Hall left to the States ‘the task of developing\nappropriate ways to enforce’ the restriction on executing the\nintellectually disabled,” 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9)\n(quoting Hall , 572 U. S., at 719), a court’s\nintellectual disability determination “must be ‘informed by the\nmedical community’s diagnostic framework,’ ” 581 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Hall , 572 U. S., at\n721). Three Members of this Court dissented from the\nmajor-ity’s treatment of Moore’s intellectual functioning and with\naspects of its adaptive-functioning analysis, but all agreed about\nthe impropriety of the Briseno factors. As The Chief Justice\nwrote in his dissenting opinion, the Briseno factors were\n“an unacceptable method of enforcing the guarantee of Atkins” and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals “therefore\nerred in using them to analyze adaptive deficits.” Moore ,\n581 U. S., at ___ (opinion of Roberts, C. J.) (slip op.,\nat 1). For the reasons we have described, the Court set\naside the judgment of the appeals court and remanded the case “for\nfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.” Id ., at ___ (slip op., at 18). II On remand the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals\nreconsidered the appeal and reached the same basic conclusion,\nnamely, that Moore had not demonstrated intellectual disability. Ex parte Moore II , 548 S. W. 3d, at 555. The court\nagain noted the three basic criteria: intellectual-functioning\ndeficits, adaptive deficits, and early onset. Id ., at\n560–562. But this time it focused almost exclusively on the second\ncriterion, adaptive deficits. The court said that, in doing so, it\nwould “abandon reliance on the Briseno evidentiary factors.” Id ., at 560. It would instead use “ ‘current medical\ndiagnostic standards’ ” set forth in the American Psychiatric\nAssociation’s DSM–5. Id ., at 559–560. In applying those\nstandards to the trial court record, it found the State’s expert\nwitness, Dr. Kristi Compton, “ ‘far more credible and\nreliable’ ” than the other experts considered by the trial\ncourt. Id ., at 562. (As in our last opinion, we neither\nsecond nor second-guess that judgment.) And, as we have said, it\nreached the same conclusion it had before. Moore has now filed a petition for certiorari in\nwhich he argues that the trial court record demonstrates his\nintellectual disability. He asks us to reverse the appeals court’s\ncontrary holding. Pet. for Cert. 2. The prosecutor, the district\nattorney of Harris County, “agrees with the petitioner that he is\nintellectually disabled and cannot be executed.” Brief in\nOpposition 9. The American Psychological Association (APA),\nAmerican Bar Association (ABA), and various individuals have also\nfiled amicus curiae briefs supporting the position of Moore\nand the prosecutor. Brief for APA et al. as Amici\nCuriae ; Brief for ABA as Amicus Curiae ; Brief for Donald\nB. Ayer et al. as Amici Curiae . The Attorney General of\nTexas, however, has filed a motion for leave to intervene, and asks\nus to deny Moore’s petition. Motion for Leave to Intervene as a\nRespondent. III After reviewing the trial court record and the\ncourt of appeals’ opinion, we agree with Moore that the appeals\ncourt’s determination is inconsistent with our opinion in Moore . We have found in its opinion too many instances in\nwhich, with small variations, it repeats the analysis we previously\nfound wanting, and these same parts are critical to its ultimate\nconclusion. For one thing, the court of appeals again relied\nless upon the adaptive deficits to which the trial court had\nreferred than upon Moore’s apparent adaptive strengths . See Moore , 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (criticizing\nthe appeals court’s “overemphas[is]” upon Moore’s “perceived\nadaptive strengths”); supra , at 3. The appeals court’s\ndiscussion of Moore’s “[c]ommunication [s]kills” does not discuss\nthe evidence relied upon by the trial court. Ex parte Moore\nII , 548 S. W. 3d, at 563–565. That evidence includes the young\nMoore’s inability to understand and answer family members, even a\nfailure on occasion to respond to his own name. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 289a–290a. Its review of Moore’s “[r]eading and [w]riting”\nrefers to deficits only in observing that “in prison, [Moore]\nprogressed from being illiterate to being able to write at a\nseventh-grade level.” Ex parte Moore II , 548 S. W. 3d,\nat 565. But the trial court heard, among other things, evidence\nthat in school Moore was made to draw pictures when other children\nwere reading, and that by sixth grade Moore struggled to read at a\nsecond-grade level. App. to Pet. for Cert. 290a, 295a. Instead, the appeals court emphasized Moore’s\ncapacity to communicate, read, and write based in part on pro se papers Moore filed in court. Ex parte\nMoore II , 548 S. W. 3d, at 565–566. That evidence is relevant,\nbut it lacks convincing strength without a determination about\nwhether Moore wrote the papers on his own, a finding that the court\nof appeals declined to make. Rather, the court dismissed the\npossibility of outside help: Even if other inmates “composed” these\npapers, it said, Moore’s “ability to copy such documents by hand”\nwas “within the realm of only a few intellectually disabled\npeople.” Id ., at 565. Similarly, the court of appeals\nstressed Moore’s “coherent” testimony in various proceedings, but\nacknowledged that Moore had “a lawyer to coach him” in all but one. Id ., at 564, and n. 95. As for that pro se hearing, the court observed that Moore read letters into the record\n“without any apparent difficulty.” Ibid . For another thing, the court of appeals relied\nheavily upon adaptive improvements made in prison. See Moore , 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13)\n(“caution[ing] against reliance on adaptive strengths developed” in\n“prison”); supra , at 3. It concluded that Moore has command\nof elementary math, but its examples concern trips to the prison\ncommissary, commissary purchases, and the like. Ex parte\nMoore II , 548 S. W. 3d, at 566–569. It determined that Moore\nhad shown leadership ability in prison by refusing, on occasion,\n“to mop up some spilled oat- meal,” shave, get a haircut, or sit\ndown. Id ., at 570–571, and n. 149. And as we have said,\nit stressed correspondence written in prison. Id ., at 565.\nThe length and detail of the court’s discussion on these points is\ndifficult to square with our caution against relying on\nprison-based development. Further, the court of appeals concluded that\nMoore failed to show that the “cause of [his] deficient social\nbehavior was related to any deficits in general mental abilities”\nrather than “emotional problems.” Id ., at 570. But in our\nlast review, we said that the court of appeals had “departed from\nclinical practice” when it required Moore to prove that his\n“problems in kindergarten” stemmed from his intellectual\ndisability, rather than “ ‘emotional problems.’ ” Moore , 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Ex parte Moore I , 470 S. W. 3d, at 488, 526)). And we\npointed to an amicus brief in which the APA explained that a\npersonality disorder or mental-health issue is “not evidence that a\nperson does not also have intellectual disability.” 581 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 14) (quoting Brief for APA et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 15–797, at 19). Finally, despite the court of appeals’ statement\nthat it would “abandon reliance on the Briseno evidentiary\nfactors,” Ex parte Moore II , 548 S. W. 3d, at\n560, it seems to have used many of those factors in reaching its\nconclusion. See supra , at 4 (detailing those factors). Thus, Briseno asked whether the “offense require[d] forethought,\nplanning, and complex execution of purpose.” 135 S. W. 3d, at 9.\nThe court of appeals wrote that Moore’s crime required “a level of\nplanning and forethought.” Ex parte Moore II , 548 S. W.\n3d, at 572, 603 (observing that Moore “w[ore] a wig, conceal[ed]\nthe weapon, and fle[d]” after the crime). Briseno asked whether the defendant could\n“respond coherently, rationally, and on point to oral and written\nquestions.” 135 S. W. 3d, at 8. The court of appeals found that\nMoore “responded rationally and coherently to questions.” Ex parte Moore II , 548 S. W. 3d, at 564. And Briseno asked whether the defendant’s\n“conduct show[s] leadership or . . . that he is led\naround by others.” 135 S. W. 3d, at 8. The court of appeals wrote\nthat Moore’s “refus[al] to mop up some spilled oatmeal” (and other\nsuch behavior) showed that he “influences others and stands up to\nauthority.” Ex parte Moore II , 548 S. W. 3d, at\n570–571. Of course, clinicians also ask questions to\nwhich the court of appeals’ statements might be relevant. See\nAAIDD–11, at 44 (noting that how a person “follows rules” and\n“obeys laws” can bear on assessment of her social skills). But the\nsimilarity of language and content between Briseno ’s factors\nand the court of appeals’ statements suggests that Briseno continues to “pervasively infec[t] the [the appeals courts’]\nanalysis.” Moore , 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n18). To be sure, the court of appeals opinion is not\nidentical to the opinion we considered in Moore . There are\nsentences here and there suggesting other modes of analysis\nconsistent with what we said. But there are also sentences here and\nthere suggesting reliance upon what we earlier called “lay\nstereotypes of the intellectually disabled.” Id ., at ___\n(slip op., at 15). Compare Ex parte Moore II , 548 S. W.\n3d, at 570–571 (finding evidence that Moore “had a girlfriend” and\na job as tending to show he lacks intellectual disability), with\nAAIDD–11, at 151 (criticizing the “incorrect stereotypes” that\npersons with intellectual disability “never have friends, jobs,\nspouses, or children”), and Brief for APA et al. as Amici\nCuriae 8 (“[I]t is estimated that between nine and forty\npercent of persons with in-tellectual disability have some form of\npaid employment”). We conclude that the appeals court’s opinion,\nwhen taken as a whole and when read in the light both of our prior\nopinion and the trial court record, rests upon analysis too much of\nwhich too closely resembles what we previously found improper. And\nextricating that analysis from the opinion leaves too little that\nmight warrant reaching a different conclusion than did the trial\ncourt. We consequently agree with Moore and the prosecutor that, on\nthe basis of the trial court record, Moore has shown he is a person\nwith intellectual disability. *  *  * The petition for certiorari is granted. The\nAttorney General of Texas’ motion to intervene is denied; we have\nconsidered that filing as an amicus brief. The judgment of\nthe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed, and the case is\nremanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this\nopinion. It is so ordered .",

CUOMO, GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK on application for injunctive relief [November 25,2020] Per Curiam. The application for injunctive relief presented\nto Justice Breyer and by him referred to the Court is granted.\nRespondent is enjoined from enforcing Executive Order 202.68’s 10-\nand 25-person occupancy limits on applicant pending disposition of\nthe appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second\nCircuit and disposition of the petition for a writ of certiorari,\nif such writ is timely sought. Should the petition for a writ of\ncertiorari be denied, this order shall terminate automatically. In\nthe event the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the\norder shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this\nCourt. * * * * * * This emergency application and another, Agudath\nIsrael of America, et al. v. Cuomo, No. 20A90, present the same\nissue, and this opinion addresses both cases. Both applications seek relief from an Executive\nOrder issued by the Governor of New York that imposes very severe\nrestrictions on attendance at religious services in areas\nclassified as “red” or “orange” zones. In red zones, no more than\n10 persons may attend each religious service, and in orange zones,\nattendance is capped at 25. The two applications, one filed by the\nRoman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and the other by Agudath Israel\nof America and affiliated entities, contend that these restrictions\nviolate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, and they\nask us to enjoin enforcement of the restrictions while they pursue\nappellate review. Citing a variety of remarks made by the Governor,\nAgudath Israel argues that the Governor specifically targeted the\nOrthodox Jewish community and gerrymandered the boundaries of red\nand orange zones to ensure that heavily Orthodox areas were\nincluded. Both the Diocese and Agudath Israel maintain that the\nregulations treat houses of worship much more harshly than\ncomparable secular facilities. And they tell us without\ncontradiction that they have complied with all public health\nguidance, have implemented additional precautionary measures, and\nhave operated at 25% or 33% capacity for months without a single\noutbreak. The applicants have clearly established their\nentitlement to relief pending appellate review. They have shown\nthat their First Amendment claims are likely to prevail, that\ndenying them relief would lead to irreparable injury, and that\ngranting relief would not harm the public interest. See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. , 555 U.S.\n7 , 20 (2008). Because of the need to issue an order promptly,\nwe provide only a brief summary of the reasons why immediate relief\nis essential. Likelihood of success on the merits . The\napplicants have made a strong showing that the challenged\nrestrictions violate “the minimum requirement of neutrality” to\nreligion. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 533 (1993). As noted by the dissent in the court below,\nstatements made in connection with the challenged rules can be\nviewed as targeting the “ ‘ultra-Orthodox [Jewish] community.’ ”\n___ F. 3d ___, ___, 2020 WL 6750495, *5 (CA2, Nov. 9, 2020)\n(Park, J., dissenting). But even if we put those comments aside,\nthe regulations cannot be viewed as neutral because they single out\nhouses of worship for especially harsh treatment.[ 1 ] In a red zone, while a synagogue or church may\nnot admit more than 10 persons, businesses categorized as\n“essential” may admit as many people as they wish. And the list of\n“essential” businesses includes things such as acupuncture\nfacilities, camp grounds, garages, as well as many whose services\nare not limited to those that can be regarded as essential, such as\nall plants manufacturing chemicals and microelectronics and all\ntransportation facilities. See New York State, Empire State\nDevelopment, Guidance for Determining Whether a Business Enterprise\nis Subject to a Workforce Reduction Under Recent Executive Orders,\nhttps://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026. The disparate\ntreatment is even more striking in an orange zone. While attendance\nat houses of worship is limited to 25 persons, even non-essential\nbusinesses may decide for themselves how many persons to admit. These categorizations lead to troubling results.\nAt the hearing in the District Court, a health department official\ntestified about a large store in Brooklyn that could “literally\nhave hundreds of people shopping there on any given day.” App. to\nApplication in No. 20A87, Exh. D, p. 83. Yet a nearby church or\nsynagogue would be prohibited from allowing more than 10 or 25\npeople inside for a worship service. And the Governor has stated\nthat factories and schools have contributed to the spread of\nCOVID–19, id ., Exh. H, at 3; App. to Application in No.\n20A90, pp. 98, 100, but they are treated less harshly than the\nDiocese’s churches and Agudath Israel’s synagogues, which have\nadmirable safety records. Because the challenged restrictions are not\n“neutral” and of “general applicability,” they must satisfy “strict\nscrutiny,” and this means that they must be “narrowly tailored” to\nserve a “compelling” state interest. Church of Lukumi , 508\nU. S., at 546. Stemming the spread of COVID–19 is\nunquestionably a compelling interest, but it is hard to see how the\nchallenged regulations can be regarded as “narrowly tailored.” They\nare far more restrictive than any COVID–related regulations that\nhave previously come before the Court,[ 2 ] much tighter than those adopted by many other\njurisdictions hard-hit by the pandemic, and far more severe than\nhas been shown to be required to prevent the spread of the virus at\nthe applicants’ services. The District Court noted that “there\nha[d] not been any COVID–19 outbreak in any of the Diocese’s\nchurches since they reopened,” and it praised the Diocese’s record\nin combatting the spread of the disease. ___ F. Supp. 3d ___,\n___, 2020 WL 6120167, *2 (EDNY, Oct. 16, 2020). It found that the\nDiocese had been constantly “ahead of the curve, enforcing stricter\nsafety protocols than the State required.” Ibid. Similarly,\nAgudath Israel notes that “[t]he Governor does not dispute that\n[it] ha[s] rigorously implemented and adhered to all health\nprotocols and that there has been no outbreak of COVID–19 in [its]\ncongregations.” Application in No. 20A90, at 36. Not only is there no evidence that the\napplicants have contributed to the spread of COVID–19 but there are\nmany other less restrictive rules that could be adopted to minimize\nthe risk to those attending religious services. Among other things,\nthe maximum attendance at a religious service could be tied to the\nsize of the church or synagogue. Almost all of the 26 Diocese\nchurches immediately affected by the Executive Order can seat at\nleast 500 people, about 14 can accommodate at least 700, and 2 can\nseat over 1,000. Similarly, Agudath Israel of Kew Garden Hills can\nseat up to 400. It is hard to believe that admitting more than 10\npeople to a 1,000–seat church or 400–seat synagogue would create a\nmore serious health risk than the many other activities that the\nState allows. Irreparable harm . There can be no\nquestion that the challenged restrictions, if enforced, will cause\nirreparable harm. “The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even\nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable\ninjury.” Elrod v. Burns , 427\nU.S. 347 , 373 (1976) (plurality opinion). If only 10 people are\nadmitted to each service, the great majority of those who wish to\nattend Mass on Sunday or services in a synagogue on Shabbat will be\nbarred. And while those who are shut out may in some instances be\nable to watch services on television, such remote viewing is not\nthe same as personal attendance. Catholics who watch a Mass at home\ncannot receive communion, and there are important religious\ntraditions in the Orthodox Jewish faith that require personal\nattendance. App. to Application in No. 20A90, at 26–27. Public interest . Finally, it has not been\nshown that granting the applications will harm the public. As\nnoted, the State has not claimed that attendance at the applicants’\nservices has resulted in the spread of the disease. And the State\nhas not shown that public health would be imperiled if less\nrestrictive measures were imposed. Members of this Court are not public health\nexperts, and we should respect the judgment of those with special\nexpertise and responsibility in this area. But even in a pandemic,\nthe Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten. The restrictions\nat issue here, by effectively barring many from attending religious\nservices, strike at the very heart of the First Amendment’s\nguarantee of religious liberty. Before allowing this to occur, we\nhave a duty to conduct a serious examination of the need for such a\ndrastic measure. The dissenting opinions argue that we should\nwithhold relief because the relevant circumstances have now\nchanged. After the applicants asked this Court for relief, the\nGovernor reclassified the areas in question from orange to yellow,\nand this change means that the applicants may hold services at 50%\nof their maximum occupancy. The dissents would deny relief at this\ntime but allow the Diocese and Agudath Israel to renew their\nrequests if this recent reclassification is reversed. There is no justification for that proposed\ncourse of action. It is clear that this matter is not moot. See Federal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life , Inc. , 551 U.S.\n449 , 462 (2007); Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc ., 528 U.S.\n167 , 189 (2000). And injunctive relief is still called for\nbecause the applicants remain under a constant threat that the area\nin question will be reclassified as red or orange. See, e.g ., Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus , 573 U.S.\n149 , 158 (2014). The Governor regularly changes the\nclassification of particular areas without prior notice.[ 3 ] If that occurs again, the\nreclassification will almost certainly bar individuals in the\naffected area from attending services before judicial relief can be\nobtained. At most Catholic churches, Mass is celebrated daily, and\n“Orthodox Jews pray in [Agudath Israel’s] synagogues every day.”\nApplication in No. 20A90, at 4. Moreover, if reclassification\noccurs late in a week, as has happened in the past, there may not\nbe time for applicants to seek and obtain relief from this Court\nbefore another Sabbath passes. Thirteen days have gone by since the\nDiocese filed its application, and Agudath Israel’s application was\nfiled over a week ago. While we could presumably act more swiftly\nin the future, there is no guarantee that we could provide relief\nbefore another weekend passes. The applicants have made the showing\nneeded to obtain relief, and there is no reason why they should\nbear the risk of suffering further irreparable harm in the event of\nanother reclassification. For these reasons, we hold that enforcement of\nthe Governor’s severe restrictions on the applicants’ religious\nservices must be enjoined. It is so ordered. Notes 1 Compare Trump v. Hawaii , 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 29)\n(directive “neutral on its face”). 2 See Calvary Chapel\nDayton Valley v.

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR SAINTS PETER AND\nPAUL HOME v . PENNSYLVANIA et al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the third circuit No. 19–431. Argued May 6, 2020—Decided July 8,\n2020[ 1 ] The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\nof 2010 (ACA) requires covered employers to provide women with\n“preventive care and screenings” without “any cost sharing\nrequirements,” and relies on Preventive Care Guidelines\n(Guidelines) “supported by the Health Resources and Services\nAdministration” (HRSA) to determine what “preventive care and\nscreenings” includes. 42 U. S. C. §300gg–13(a)(4). Those Guidelines\nmandate that health plans provide coverage for all Food and Drug\nAdministration approved contraceptive methods. When the Departments\nof Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury (Departments)\nincorporated the Guidelines, they also gave HRSA the discretion to\nexempt religious employers, such as churches, from providing\ncontraceptive coverage. Later, the Departments also promulgated a\nrule accommodating qualifying religious organizations that allowed\nthem to opt out of coverage by self-certifying that they met\ncertain criteria to their health insurance issuer, which would then\nexclude contraceptive coverage from the employer’s plan and provide\nparticipants with separate payments for contraceptive services\nwithout imposing any cost-sharing requirements. Religious entities challenged the rules under\nthe Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA). In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. , 573 U.S.\n682 , this Court held that the contraceptive mandate\nsubstantially burdened the free exercise of closely held\ncorporations with sincerely held religious objections to providing\ntheir employees with certain methods of contraception. And in Zubik v. Burwell , 578 U. S. ___, the Court opted to\nremand without deciding the RFRA question in cases challenging the\nself-certification accommodation so that the parties could develop\nan approach that would accommodate employers’ concerns while\nproviding women full and equal coverage. Under Zubik ’s direction and in light of Hobby Lobby ’s holding, the Departments promulgated two\ninterim final rules (IFRs). The first significantly expanded the\nchurch exemption to include an employer that “objects\n. . . based on its sincerely held religious beliefs,” “to\nits establishing, maintaining, providing, offering, or arranging\n[for] coverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services.”\n82 Fed. Reg. 47812. The second created a similar “moral exemption”\nfor employers with sincerely held moral objections to providing\nsome or all forms of contraceptive coverage. The Departments\nrequested post-promulgation comments on both IFRs. Pennsylvania sued, alleging that the IFRs were\nprocedurally and substantively invalid under the Administrative\nProcedure Act (APA). After the Departments issued final rules,\nresponding to post-promulgation comments but leaving the IFRs\nlargely intact, New Jersey joined Pennsylvania’s suit. Together\nthey filed an amended complaint, alleging that the rules were\nsubstantively unlawful because the Departments lacked statutory\nauthority under either the ACA or RFRA to promulgate the\nexemptions. They also argued that the rules were procedurally\ndefective because the Departments failed to comply with the APA’s\nnotice and comment procedures. The District Court issued a\npreliminary nationwide injunction against the implementation of the\nfinal rules, and the Third Circuit affirmed. Held : 1. The Departments had the authority\nunder the ACA to promulgate the religious and moral exemptions.\nPp. 14–22. (a) As legal authority for both\nexemptions, the Departments invoke §300gg–13(a)(4), which states\nthat group health plans must provide women with “preventive care\nand screenings . . . as provided for in comprehensive guidelines\nsupported by [HRSA].” The pivotal phrase, “as provided for,” grants\nsweeping authority to HRSA to define the preventive care that\napplicable health plans must cover. That same grant of authority\nempowers it to identify and create exemptions from its own\nGuidelines. The “fundamental principle of statutory interpretation\nthat ‘absent provision[s] cannot be supplied by the courts,’ ” Rotkiske v. Klemm , 589 U. S. ___, ___ applies\nnot only to adding terms not found in the statute, but also to\nimposing limits on an agency’s discretion that are not supported by\nthe text, see Watt v. Energy Action Ed. Foundation , 454 U.S.\n151 , 168. Concerns that the exemptions thwart Congress’ intent\nby making it significantly harder for interested women to obtain\nseamless access to contraception without cost-sharing cannot\njustify supplanting the text’s plain meaning. Even if such concerns\nare legitimate, they are more properly directed at the regulatory\nmechanism that Congress put in place. Pp. 14–18. (b) Because the ACA provided a basis for\nboth exemptions, the Court need not decide whether RFRA\nindependently compelled the Departments’ solution. However, the\nargument that the Departments could not consider RFRA at all is\nwithout merit. It is clear from the face of the statute that the\ncontraceptive mandate is capable of violating RFRA. The ACA does\nnot explicitly exempt RFRA, and the regulations implementing the\ncontraceptive mandate qualify as “Federal law” or “the\nimplementation of [Federal] law” under RFRA. §2000bb–3(a).\nAdditionally, this Court stated in Hobby Lobby that\nthe mandate violated RFRA as applied to entities with\ncomplicity-based objections. And both Hobby Lobby and Zubik instructed the Departments to consider RFRA going\nforward. Moreover, in light of the basic requirements of the\nrulemaking process, the Departments’ failure to discuss RFRA at all\nwhen formulating their solution would make them susceptible to\nclaims that the rules were arbitrary and capricious for failing to\nconsider an important aspect of the problem. Pp. 19–22. 2. The rules promulgating the exemptions\nare free from procedural defects. Pp. 22–26. (a) Respondents claim that because the\nfinal rules were preceded by a document entitled “Interim Final\nRules with Request for Comments” instead of “General Notice of\nProposed Rulemaking,” they are procedurally invalid under the APA.\nThe IFRs’ request for comments readily satisfied the APA notice\nrequirements. And even assuming that the APA requires an agency to\npublish a document entitled “notice of proposed rulemaking,” there\nwas no “prejudicial error” here, 5 U. S. C. §706. Pp.\n22–24. (b) Pointing to the fact that the final\nrules made only minor alterations to the IFRs, respondents also\ncontend that the final rules are procedurally invalid because\nnothing in the record suggests that the Departments maintained an\nopen mind during the post-promulgation process. The\n“open-mindedness” test has no basis in the APA. Each of the APA’s\nprocedural requirements was satisfied: The IFRs provided sufficient\nnotice, §553(b); the Departments “g[a]ve interested persons an\nopportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of\nwritten data, views or arguments,” §553(c); the final rules\ncontained “a concise general statement of their basis and purpose,” ibid. ; and they were published more than 30 days before they\nbecame effective, §553(d). Pp. 24–26. 930 F.3d 543, reversed and remanded. Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Alito, Gorsuch, and\nKavanaugh, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ Nos. 19–431 and 19–454 _________________ LITTLE SISTERS OF THE POOR SAINTS PETER\nAND PAUL HOME, PETITIONER 19–431 v. PENNSYLVANIA, et al. DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\nSTATES, et al., PETITIONERS 19–454 v. PENNSYLVANIA, et al. on writs of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the third circuit [July 8, 2020] Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. In these consolidated cases, we decide whether\nthe Government created lawful exemptions from a regulatory\nrequirement implementing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care\nAct of 2010 (ACA), 124Stat. 119. The requirement at issue obligates\ncertain employers to provide contraceptive coverage to their\nemployees through their group health plans. Though contraceptive\ncoverage is not required by (or even mentioned in) the ACA\nprovision at issue, the Government mandated such coverage by\npromulgating interim final rules (IFRs) shortly after the ACA’s\npassage. This requirement is known as the contraceptive\nmandate. After six years of protracted litigation, the\nDepartments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury\n(Departments)—which jointly administer the relevant ACA\nprovision[ 1 ]—exempted certain\nemployers who have religious and conscientious objections from this\nagency-created mandate. The Third Circuit concluded that the\nDepartments lacked statutory authority to promulgate these\nexemptions and affirmed the District Court’s nationwide preliminary\ninjunction. This decision was erroneous. We hold that the\nDepartments had the authority to provide exemptions from the\nregulatory contraceptive requirements for employers with religious\nand conscientious objections. We accordingly reverse the Third\nCircuit’s judgment and remand with instructions to dissolve the\nnationwide preliminary injunction. I The ACA’s contraceptive mandate—a product of\nagency regulation—has existed for approximately nine years.\nLitigation surrounding that requirement has lasted nearly as long.\nIn light of this extensive history, we begin by summarizing the\nrelevant background. A The ACA requires covered employers to offer “a\ngroup health plan or group health insurance coverage” that provides\ncertain “minimum essential coverage.” 26 U. S. C.\n§5000A(f )(2); §§4980H(a), (c)(2). Employers who do not comply\nface hefty penalties, including potential fines of $100 per day for\neach affected employee. §§4980D(a)–(b); see also Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc. , 573\nU.S. 682 , 696–697 (2014). These cases concern regulations\npromulgated under a provision of the ACA that requires covered\nemployers to provide women with “preventive care and screenings”\nwithout “any cost sharing requirements.” 42 U. S. C.\n§300gg–13(a)(4).[ 2 ] The statute does not define “preventive care and\nscreenings,” nor does it include an exhaustive or illustrative list\nof such services. Thus, the statute itself does not explicitly\nrequire coverage for any specific form of “preventive care.” Hobby Lobby , 573 U. S., at 697. Instead, Congress\nstated that coverage must include “such additional preventive care\nand screenings . . . as provided for in comprehensive\nguidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services\nAdministration” (HRSA), an agency of the Department of Health and\nHuman Services (HHS). §300gg–13(a)(4). At the time of the ACA’s\nenactment, these guidelines were not yet written. As a result, no\nspecific forms of preventive care or screenings were (or could be)\nreferred to or incorporated by reference. Soon after the ACA’s passage, the Departments\nbegan promulgating rules related to §300gg–13(a)(4). But in doing\nso, the Departments did not proceed through the notice and comment\nrulemaking process, which the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)\noften requires before an agency’s regulation can “have the force\nand effect of law.” Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Assn. ,\n575 U.S. 92, 96 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\n5 U. S. C. §553. Instead, the Departments invoked the\nAPA’s good cause exception, which permits an agency to dispense\nwith notice and comment and promulgate an IFR that carries\nimmediate legal force. §553(b)(3)(B). The first relevant IFR, promulgated in July\n2010, primarily focused on implementing other aspects of §300gg–13.\n75 Fed. Reg. 41728. The IFR indicated that HRSA planned to develop\nits Preventive Care Guidelines (Guidelines) by August 2011. Ibid. However, it did not mention religious exemptions or\naccommodations of any kind. As anticipated, HRSA released its first set of\nGuidelines in August 2011. The Guidelines were based on\nrecommendations compiled by the Institute of Medicine (now called\nthe National Academy of Medicine), “a nonprofit group of volunteer\nadvisers.” Hobby Lobby , 573 U. S., at 697. The\nGuidelines included the contraceptive mandate, which required\nhealth plans to provide coverage for all contraceptive methods and\nsterilization procedures approved by the Food and Drug\nAdministration as well as related education and counseling. 77 Fed.\nReg. 8725 (2012). The same day the Guidelines were issued, the\nDepartments amended the 2010 IFR. 76 Fed. Reg. 46621 (2011). When\nthe 2010 IFR was originally published, the Departments began\nreceiving comments from numerous religious employers expressing\nconcern that the Guidelines would “impinge upon their religious\nfreedom” if they included contraception. Id. , at 46623. As\njust stated, the Guidelines ultimately did contain contraceptive\ncoverage, thus making the potential impact on religious freedom a\nreality. In the amended IFR, the Departments determined that “it\n[was] appropriate that HRSA . . . tak[e] into account the\n[mandate’s] effect on certain religious employers” and concluded\nthat HRSA had the discretion to do so through the creation of an\nexemption. Ibid. The Departments then determined that the\nexemption should cover religious employers, and they set out a\nfour-part test to identify which employers qualified. The last\ncriterion required the entity to be a church, an integrated\nauxiliary, a convention or association of churches, or “the\nexclusively religious activities of any religious order.” Ibid. HRSA created an exemption for these employers the same\nday. 78 Fed. Reg. 39871 (2013). Because of the narrow focus on\nchurches, this first exemption is known as the church\nexemption. The Guidelines were scheduled to go into effect\nfor plan years beginning on August 1, 2012. 77 Fed. Reg. 8725–8726.\nBut in February 2012, before the Guidelines took effect, the\nDepartments promulgated a final rule that temporarily prevented the\nGuidelines from applying to certain religious nonprofits.\nSpecifically, the Departments stated their intent to promulgate\nadditional rules to “accommodat[e] non-exempted, non-profit\norganizations’ religious objections to covering contraceptive\nservices.” Id. , at 8727. Until that rulemaking occurred, the\n2012 rule also provided a temporary safe harbor to protect such\nemployers. Ibid. The safe harbor covered nonprofits “whose\nplans have consistently not covered all or the same subset of\ncontraceptive services for religious reasons.”[ 3 ] Thus, the nonprofits who availed themselves of\nthis safe harbor were not subject to the contraceptive mandate when\nit first became effective. The Departments promulgated another\nfinal rule in 2013 that is relevant to these cases in two ways.\nFirst, after reiterating that §300gg–13(a)(4) authorizes HRSA “to\nissue guidelines in a manner that exempts group health plans\nestablished or maintained by religious employers,” the Departments\n“simplif[ied]” and “clarif[ied]” the definition of a religious\nemployer. 78 Fed. Reg. 39873.[ 4 ] Second, pursuant to that same authority, the\nDepartments provided the anticipated accommodation for eligible\nreligious organizations, which the regulation defined as\norganizations that “(1) [o]ppos[e] providing coverage for some or\nall of the contraceptive services . . . on account of\nreligious objections; (2) [are] organized and operat[e] as\n. . . nonprofit entit[ies]; (3) hol[d] [themselves] out\nas . . . religious organization[s]; and (4)\nself-certif[y] that [they] satisf[y] the first three criteria.” Id. , at 39874. The accommodation required an eligible\norganization to provide a copy of the self-certification form to\nits health insurance issuer, which in turn would exclude\ncontraceptive coverage from the group health plan and provide\npayments to beneficiaries for contraceptive services separate from\nthe health plan. Id. , at 39878. The Departments stated that\nthe accommodation aimed to “protec[t]” religious organizations\n“from having to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for\n[contraceptive] coverage” in a way that was consistent with and did\nnot violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA),\n107Stat. 1488, 42 U. S. C. §2000bb et seq. 78 Fed.\nReg. 39871, 39886–39887. This accommodation is referred to as the\nself-certification accommodation. B Shortly after the Departments promulgated the\n2013 final rule, two religious nonprofits run by the Little Sisters\nof the Poor (Little Sisters) challenged the self-certification\naccommodation. The Little Sisters “are an international\ncongregation of Roman Catholic women religious” who have operated\nhomes for the elderly poor in the United States since 1868. See\nMission Statement: Little Sisters of the Poor,\nhttp://www.littlesistersofthepoor.org/mission-statement. They feel\ncalled by their faith to care for their elderly residents\nregardless of “faith, finances, or frailty.” Brief for Residents\nand Families of Residents at Homes of the Little Sisters of the\nPoor as Amici Curiae 14. The Little Sisters endeavor to\ntreat all residents “as if they were Jesus [Christ] himself, cared\nfor as family, and treated with dignity until God calls them to his\nhome.” Complaint ¶14 in Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the\nAged , Denver , Colo. v. Sebelius , No.\n1:13–cv–02611 (D Colo.), p. 5 (Complaint). Consistent with their Catholic faith, the Little\nSisters hold the religious conviction “that deliberately avoiding\nreproduction through medical means is immoral.” Little Sisters\nof the Poor Home for the Aged , Denver , Colo. v. Burwell , 794 F.3d 1151, 1167 (CA10 2015). They challenged\nthe self-certification accommodation, claiming that completing the\ncertification form would force them to violate their religious\nbeliefs by “tak[ing] actions that directly cause others to provide\ncontraception or appear to participate in the Departments’ delivery\nscheme.” Id. , at 1168. As a result, they alleged that the\nself-certification accommodation violated RFRA. Under RFRA, a law\nthat substantially burdens the exercise of religion must serve “a\ncompelling governmental interest” and be “the least restrictive\nmeans of furthering that compelling governmental interest.”\n§§2000bb–1(a)–(b). The Court of Appeals disagreed that the\nself-certification accommodation substantially burdened the Little\nSisters’ free exercise rights and thus rejected their RFRA claim. Little Sisters , 794 F. 3d, at 1160. The Little Sisters were far from alone in\nraising RFRA challenges to the self-certification accommodation.\nReligious nonprofit organizations and educational institutions\nacross the country filed a spate of similar lawsuits, most\nresulting in rulings that the accommodation did not violate RFRA.\nSee, e.g. , East Texas Baptist Univ. v. Burwell , 793 F.3d 449 (CA5 2015); Geneva College v. Secretary , U. S. Dept. of Health and Human\nServs. , 778 F.3d 422 (CA3 2015); Priests for Life v. United States Dept. of Health and Human Servs. , 772 F.3d 229\n(CADC 2014); Michigan Catholic Conference v. Burwell ,\n755 F.3d 372 (CA6 2014); University of Notre Dame v. Sebelius , 743 F.3d 547 (CA7 2014); but see Sharpe\nHoldings , Inc. v. United States Dept. of Health and\nHuman Servs. , 801 F.3d 927 (CA8 2015); Dordt College v. Burwell , 801 F.3d 946 (CA8 2015). We granted certiorari in\ncases from four Courts of Appeals to decide the RFRA question. Zubik v. Burwell , 578 U. S. ___, ___ (2016)\n( per curiam ). Ultimately, however, we opted to remand the\ncases without deciding that question. In supplemental briefing, the\nGovernment had “confirm[ed]” that “ ‘contraceptive coverage\ncould be provided to petitioners’ employees, through petitioners’\ninsurance companies, without any . . . notice from\npetitioners.’ ” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 3).\nPetitioners, for their part, had agreed that such an approach would\nnot violate their free exercise rights. Ibid. Accordingly,\nbecause all parties had accepted that an alternative approach was\n“feasible,” ibid. , we directed the Government to\n“accommodat[e] petitioners’ religious exercise while at the same\ntime ensuring that women covered by petitioners’ health plans\nreceive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive\ncoverage,” id. , at ___ (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). C Zubik was not the only relevant ruling\nfrom this Court about the contraceptive mandate. As the Little\nSisters and numerous others mounted their challenges to the\nself-certification accommodation, a host of other entities\nchallenged the contraceptive mandate itself as a violation of RFRA.\nSee, e.g. , Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc. v. Sebelius , 723 F.3d 1114 (CA10 2013) (en banc); Korte v. Sebelius , 735 F.3d 654 (CA7 2013); Gilardi v. United States Dept. of Health and Human Servs. , 733 F.3d\n1208 (CADC 2013); Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Secretary of U. S. Dept. of Health and Human\nServs. , 724 F.3d 377 (CA3 2013); Autocam Corp. v. Sebelius , 730 F.3d 618 (CA6 2013). This Court granted\ncertiorari in two cases involving three closely held corporations\nto decide whether the mandate violated RFRA. Hobby Lobby , 573 U.S.\n682 . The individual respondents in Hobby\nLobby opposed four methods of contraception covered by the\nmandate. They sincerely believed that human life begins at\nconception and that, because the challenged methods of\ncontraception risked causing the death of a human embryo, providing\nthose methods of contraception to employees would make the\nemployers complicit in abortion. Id. , at 691, 720. We held\nthat the mandate substantially burdened respondents’ free exercise,\nexplaining that “[if] the owners comply with the HHS mandate, they\nbelieve they will be facilitating abortions, and if they do not\ncomply, they will pay a very heavy price.” Id. , at 691. “If\nthese consequences do not amount to a substantial burden,” we\nstated, “it is hard to see what would.” Ibid. We also held\nthat the mandate did not utilize the least restrictive means,\nciting the self-certification accommodation as a less burdensome\nalternative. Id. , at 730–731. Thus, as the Departments began the task of\nreformulating rules related to the contraceptive mandate, they did\nso not only under Zubik ’s direction to accommodate religious\nexercise, but also against the backdrop of Hobby Lobby ’s\npronouncement that the mandate, standing alone, violated RFRA as\napplied to religious entities with complicity-based objections. D In 2016, the Departments attempted to strike\nthe proper balance a third time, publishing a request for\ninformation on ways to comply with Zubik . 81 Fed. Reg.\n47741. This attempt proved futile, as the Departments ultimately\nconcluded that “no feasible approach” had been identified. Dept. of\nLabor, FAQs About Affordable Care Act Implementation Part 36,\np. 4 (2017). The Departments maintained their position that\nthe self-certification accommodation was consistent with RFRA\nbecause it did not impose a substantial burden and, even if it did,\nit utilized the least restrictive means of achieving the\nGovernment’s interests. Id. , at 4–5. In 2017, the Departments tried yet again to\ncomply with Zubik , this time by promulgating the two IFRs\nthat served as the impetus for this litigation. The first IFR\nsignificantly broadened the definition of an exempt religious\nemployer to encompass an employer that “objects . . .\nbased on its sincerely held religious beliefs,” “to its\nestablishing, maintaining, providing, offering, or arranging [for]\ncoverage or payments for some or all contraceptive services.” 82\nFed. Reg. 47812 (2017). Among other things, this definition\nincluded for-profit and publicly traded entities. Because they were\nexempt, these employers did not need to participate in the\naccommodation process, which nevertheless remained available under\nthe IFR. Id. , at 47806. As with their previous regulations, the\nDepartments once again invoked §300gg–13(a)(4) as authority to\npromulgate this “religious exemption,” stating that it “include[d]\nthe ability to exempt entities from coverage requirements announced\nin HRSA’s Guidelines.” Id. , at 47794. Additionally, the\nDepartments announced for the first time that RFRA compelled the\ncreation of, or at least provided the discretion to create, the\nreligious exemption. Id. , at 47800–47806. As the Departments\nexplained: “We know from Hobby Lobby that, in the absence of\nany accommodation, the contraceptive-coverage requirement imposes a\nsubstantial burden on certain objecting employers. We know from\nother lawsuits and public comments that many religious entities\nhave objections to complying with the [self-certification]\naccommodation based on their sincerely held religious beliefs.” Id. , at 47806. The Departments “believe[d] that the Court’s\nanalysis in Hobby Lobby extends, for the purposes of\nanalyzing a substantial burden, to the burdens that an entity faces\nwhen it religiously opposes participating in the\n[self-certification] accommodation process.” Id. , at 47800.\nThey thus “conclude[d] that it [was] appropriate to expand the\nexemption to other . . . organizations with sincerely\nheld religious beliefs opposed to contraceptive coverage.” Id. , at 47802; see also id. , at 47810–47811. The second IFR created a similar “moral\nexemption” for employers—including nonprofits and for-profits with\nno publicly traded components—with “sincerely held moral”\nobjections to providing some or all forms of contraceptive\ncoverage. Id. , at 47850, 47861–47862. Citing congressional\nenactments, precedents from this Court, agency practice, and state\nlaws that provided for conscience protections, id. , at\n47844–47847, the Departments invoked their authority under the ACA\nto create this exemption, id. , at 47844. The Departments\nrequested post-promulgation comments on both IFRs. Id. , at\n47813, 47854. E Within a week of the 2017 IFRs’ promulgation,\nthe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed an action seeking\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief. Among other claims, it alleged\nthat the IFRs were procedurally and substantively invalid under the\nAPA. The District Court held that the Commonwealth was likely to\nsucceed on both claims and granted a preliminary nationwide\ninjunction against the IFRs. The Federal Government appealed. While that appeal was pending, the Departments\nissued rules finalizing the 2017 IFRs. See 83 Fed. Reg. 57536\n(2018); 83 Fed. Reg. 57592, codified at 45 CFR pt. 147 (2018).\nThough the final rules left the exemptions largely intact, they\nalso responded to post-promulgation comments, explaining their\nreasons for neither narrowing nor expanding the exemptions beyond\nwhat was provided for in the IFRs. See 83 Fed. Reg. 57542–57545,\n57598–57603. The final rule creating the religious exemption also\ncontained a lengthy analysis of the Departments’ changed position\nregarding whether the self-certification process violated RFRA. Id. , at 57544–57549. And the Departments explained that, in\nthe wake of the numerous lawsuits challenging the\nself-certification accommodation and the failed attempt to identify\nalternative accommodations after the 2016 request for information,\n“an expanded exemption rather than the existing accommodation is\nthe most appropriate administrative response to the substantial\nburden identified by the Supreme Court in Hobby Lobby .” Id. , at 57544–57545. After the final rules were promulgated, the\nState of New Jersey joined Pennsylvania’s suit and, together, they\nfiled an amended complaint. As relevant, the States—respondents\nhere—once again challenged the rules as substantively and\nprocedurally invalid under the APA. They alleged that the rules\nwere substantively unlawful because the Departments lacked\nstatutory authority under either the ACA or RFRA to promulgate the\nexemptions. Respondents also asserted that the IFRs were not\nadequately justified by good cause, meaning that the Departments\nimpermissibly used the IFR procedure to bypass the APA’s notice and\ncomment procedures. Finally, respondents argued that the purported\nprocedural defects of the IFRs likewise infected the final\nrules. The District Court issued a nationwide\npreliminary injunction against the implementation of the final\nrules the same day the rules were scheduled to take effect. The\nFederal Government appealed, as did one of the homes operated by\nthe Little Sisters, which had in the meantime intervened in the\nsuit to defend the religious exemption.[ 5 ] The appeals were consolidated with the previous appeal,\nwhich had been stayed. The Third Circuit affirmed. In its view, the\nDepartments lacked authority to craft the exemptions under either\nstatute. The Third Circuit read 42 U. S. C.\n§300gg–13(a)(4) as empowering HRSA to determine which services\nshould be included as preventive care and screenings, but not to\ncarve out exemptions from those requirements. It also concluded\nthat RFRA did not compel or permit the religious exemption because,\nunder Third Circuit precedent that was vacated and remanded in Zubik , the Third Circuit had concluded that the\nself-certification accommodation did not impose a substantial\nburden on free exercise. As for respondents’ procedural claim, the\ncourt held that the Departments lacked good cause to bypass notice\nand comment when promulgating the 2017 IFRs. In addition, the court\ndetermined that, because the IFRs and final rules were “virtually\nidentical,” “[t]he notice and comment exercise surrounding the\nFinal Rules [did] not reflect any real open-mindedness.” Pennsylvania v. President of United States , 930 F.3d\n543, 568–569 (2019). Though it rebuked the Departments for their\npurported attitudinal deficiencies, the Third Circuit did not\nidentify any specific public comments to which the agency did not\nappropriately respond. Id. , at 569, n. 24.[ 6 ] We granted certiorari. 589\nU. S. ___ (2020). II Respondents contend that the 2018 final rules\nproviding religious and moral exemptions to the contraceptive\nmandate are both substantively and procedurally invalid. We begin\nwith their substantive argument that the Departments lacked\nstatutory authority to promulgate the rules. A The Departments invoke 42 U. S. C.\n§300gg–13(a)(4) as legal authority for both exemptions. This\nprovision of the ACA states that, “with respect to women,” “[a]\ngroup health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or\nindividual health insurance coverage shall, at a minimum provide\n. . . such additional preventive care and screenings not\ndescribed in paragraph (1) as provided for in comprehensive\nguidelines supported by [HRSA].” The Departments maintain, as they\nhave since 2011, that the phrase “as provided for” allows HRSA both\nto identify what preventive care and screenings must be covered and\nto exempt or accommodate certain employers’ religious objections.\nSee 83 Fed. Reg. 57540–57541; see also post , at 3 (Kagan,\nJ., concurring in judgment). They also argue that, as with the\nchurch exemption, their role as the administering agencies permits\nthem to guide HRSA in its discretion by “defining the scope of\npermissible exemptions and accommodations for such guidelines.” 82\nFed. Reg. 47794. Respondents, on the other hand, contend that\n§300gg–13(a)(4) permits HRSA to only list the preventive care and\nscreenings that health plans “shall . . . provide,” not\nto exempt entities from covering those identified services. Because\nthat asserted limitation is found nowhere in the statute, we agree\nwith the Departments. “Our analysis begins and ends with the text.” Octane Fitness , LLC v. ICON Health &\nFitness , Inc. , 572 U.S.\n545 , 553 (2014). Here, the pivotal phrase is “as provided for.”\nTo “provide” means to supply, furnish, or make available. See\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary 1827 (2002) (Webster’s\nThird); American Heritage Dictionary 1411 (4th ed. 2000); 12 Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary 713 (2d ed. 1989). And, as the Departments\nexplained, the word “as” functions as an adverb modifying\n“provided,” indicating “the ma",

MONTANA\nDEPARTMENT OF REVENUE et al. certiorari to the supreme court of montana No. 18–1195. Argued January 22, 2020—Decided\nJune 30, 2020 The Montana Legislature established a program\nthat grants tax credits to those who donate to organizations that\naward scholarships for private school tuition. To reconcile the\nprogram with a provision of the Montana Constitution that bars\ngovernment aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination,” Art. X, §6(1), the Montana\nDepartment of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,” which prohibited\nfamilies from using the scholarships at religious schools. Three\nmothers who were blocked by Rule 1 from using scholarship funds for\ntheir children’s tuition at Stillwater Christian School sued the\nDepartment in state court, alleging that the Rule discriminated on\nthe basis of their religious views and the religious nature of the\nschool they had chosen. The trial court enjoined Rule 1. Reversing,\nthe Montana Supreme Court held that the program, unmodified by Rule\n1, aided religious schools in violation of the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. The Court further held that the\nviolation required invalidating the entire program. Held : The application of the\nno-aid provision discriminated against religious schools and the\nfamilies whose children attend or hope to attend them in violation\nof the Free Exercise Clause of the Federal Constitution.\nPp. 6–22. (a) The Free Exercise Clause “protects\nreligious observers against unequal treatment” and against “laws\nthat impose special disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer ,\n582 U. S. ___, ___. In Trinity Lutheran , this Court\nheld that disqualifying otherwise eligible recipients from a public\nbenefit “solely because of their religious character” imposes “a\npenalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most\nexacting scrutiny.” Id. , at ___. Here, the application of\nMontana’s no-aid provision excludes religious schools from public\nbenefits solely because of religious status. As a result, strict\nscrutiny applies. Pp. 6–12. (b) Contrary to the Department’s\ncontention, this case is not governed by Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S.\n712 . The plaintiff in Locke was denied a scholarship\n“because of what he proposed to do —use the funds to prepare\nfor the ministry,” an essentially religious endeavor. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. By contrast, Montana’s no-aid\nprovision does not zero in on any essentially religious course of\ninstruction but rather bars aid to a religious school “simply\nbecause of what it is”—a religious school. Id. , at ___. Locke also invoked a “historic and substantial” state\ninterest in not funding the training of clergy, 540 U. S., at\n725, but no comparable tradition supports Montana’s decision to\ndisqualify religious schools from government aid.\nPp. 12–16. (c) The proposed alternative approach\ninvolving a flexible case-by-case analysis is inconsistent with Trinity Lutheran . The protections of the Free Exercise\nClause do not depend on a varying case-by-case analysis regarding\nwhether discrimination against religious adherents would serve\nill-defined interests. Pp. 16–18. (d) To satisfy strict scrutiny, government\naction “must advance ‘interests of the highest order’ and must be\nnarrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.” Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546. Montana’s interest in creating greater separation of\nchurch and State than the Federal Constitution requires “cannot\nqualify as compelling” in the face of the infringement of free\nexercise here. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. The\nDepartment’s argument that the no-aid provision actually promotes\nreligious freedom is unavailing because an infringement of First\nAmendment rights cannot be justified by a State’s alternative view\nthat the infringement advances religious liberty. The Department’s\nargument is especially unconvincing because the infringement here\nbroadly burdens not only religious schools but also the families\nwhose children attend them. The Department suggests that the no-aid\nprovision safeguards public education by ensuring that government\nsupport is not diverted to private schools, but that interest does\nnot justify a no-aid provision that requires only religious private\nschools to bear its weight. Pp. 18–20. (e) Because the Free Exercise Clause\nbarred the application of the no-aid provision here, the Montana\nSupreme Court had no authority to invalidate the program on the\nbasis of that provision. The Department argues that the\ninvalidation of the entire program prevented a free exercise\nviolation, but the Department overlooks the Montana Supreme Court’s\nthreshold error of federal law. Had the Montana Supreme Court\nrecognized that the application of the no-aid provision was barred\nby the Free Exercise Clause, the Court would have had no basis for\ninvalidating the program. The Court was obligated to disregard the\nno-aid provision and decide this case consistent with the Federal\nConstitution. Pp. 20–22. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603, reversed and\nremanded. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, in which Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ.,\njoined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Gorsuch,\nJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 18–1195 _________________ KENDRA ESPINOZA, et al., PETITIONERS v. MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, et al. on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmontana [June 30, 2020] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. The Montana Legislature established a program to\nprovide tuition assistance to parents who send their children to\nprivate schools. The program grants a tax credit to anyone who\ndonates to certain organizations that in turn award scholarships to\nselected students attending such schools. When petitioners sought\nto use the scholarships at a religious school, the Montana Supreme\nCourt struck down the program. The Court relied on the “no-aid”\nprovision of the State Constitution, which prohibits any aid to a\nschool controlled by a “church, sect, or denomination.” The\nquestion presented is whether the Free Exercise Clause of the\nUnited States Constitution barred that application of the no-aid\nprovision. I A In 2015, the Montana Legislature sought “to\nprovide parental and student choice in education” by enacting a\nscholarship program for students attending private schools. 2015\nMont. Laws p. 2168, §7. The program grants a tax credit of up to\n$150 to any taxpayer who donates to a participating “student\nscholarship organization.” Mont. Code Ann. §§15–30–3103(1),\n–3111(1) (2019). The scholarship organizations then use the\ndonations to award scholarships to children for tuition at a\nprivate school. §§15–30–3102(7)(a), –3103(1)(c).[ 1 ] So far only one scholarship organization, Big\nSky Scholarships, has participated in the program. Big Sky focuses\non providing scholarships to families who face financial hardship\nor have children with disabilities. Scholarship organizations like\nBig Sky must, among other requirements, maintain an application\nprocess for awarding the scholarships; use at least 90% of all\ndonations on scholarship awards; and comply with state reporting\nand monitoring requirements. §§15–30–3103(1), –3105(1),\n–3113(1). A family whose child is awarded a scholarship\nunder the program may use it at any “qualified education\nprovider”—that is, any private school that meets certain\naccreditation, testing, and safety requirements. See\n§15–30–3102(7). Virtually every private school in Montana\nqualifies. Upon receiving a scholarship, the family designates its\nschool of choice, and the scholarship organization sends the\nscholarship funds directly to the school. §15–30–3104(1). Neither\nthe scholarship organization nor its donors can restrict awards to\nparticular types of schools. See §§15–30–3103(1)(b), –3111(1). The Montana Legislature allotted $3 million\nannually to fund the tax credits, beginning in 2016.\n§15–30–3111(5)(a). If the annual allotment is exhausted, it\nincreases by 10% the following year. Ibid. The program is\nslated to expire in 2023. 2015 Mont. Laws p. 2186, §33. The Montana Legislature also directed that the\nprogram be administered in accordance with Article X, section 6, of\nthe Montana Constitution, which contains a “no-aid” provision\nbarring government aid to sectarian schools. See Mont. Code Ann.\n§15–30–3101. In full, that provision states: “ Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools . . . . The legislature, counties, cities, towns,\nschool districts, and public corporations shall not make any direct\nor indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or\nmonies, or any grant of lands or other property for any sectarian\npurpose or to aid any church, school, academy, seminary, college,\nuniversity, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled\nin whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.” Mont.\nConst., Art. X, §6(1). Shortly after the scholarship program was\ncreated, the Montana Department of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,”\nover the objection of the Montana Attorney General. That\nadministrative rule prohibited families from using scholarships at\nreligious schools. Mont. Admin. Rule §42.4.802(1)(a) (2015). It did\nso by changing the definition of “qualified education provider” to\nexclude any school “owned or controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, religious sect, or denomination.” Ibid. The\nDepartment explained that the Rule was needed to reconcile the\nscholarship program with the no-aid provision of the Montana\nConstitution. The Montana Attorney General disagreed. In a\nletter to the Department, he advised that the Montana Constitution\ndid not require excluding religious schools from the program, and\nif it did, it would “very likely” violate the United States\nConstitution by discriminating against the schools and their\nstudents. See Complaint in No. DV–15–1152A (Dist. Ct. Flathead\nCty.), Exh. 3, pp. 2, 5–6. The Attorney General is not representing\nthe Department in this case. B This suit was brought by three mothers whose\nchildren attend Stillwater Christian School in northwestern\nMontana. Stillwater is a private Christian school that meets the\nstatutory criteria for “qualified education providers.” It serves\nstudents in prekindergarten through 12th grade, and petitioners\nchose the school in large part because it “teaches the same\nChristian values that [they] teach at home.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n152; see id. , at 138, 167. The child of one petitioner has\nalready received scholarships from Big Sky, and the other\npetitioners’ children are eligible for scholarships and planned to\napply. While in effect, however, Rule 1 blocked petitioners from\nusing scholarship funds for tuition at Stillwater. To overcome that\nobstacle, petitioners sued the Department of Revenue in Montana\nstate court. Petitioners claimed that Rule 1 conflicted with the\nstatute that created the scholarship program and could not be\njustified on the ground that it was compelled by the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. Petitioners further alleged that\nthe Rule discriminated on the basis of their religious views and\nthe religious nature of the school they had chosen for their\nchildren. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, holding that it\nwas based on a mistake of law. The court explained that the Rule\nwas not required by the no-aid provision, because that provision\nprohibits only “appropriations” that aid religious schools, “not\ntax credits.” Id. , at 94. The injunctive relief freed Big Sky to award\nscholarships to students regardless of whether they attended a\nreligious or secular school. For the school year beginning in fall\n2017, Big Sky received 59 applications and ultimately awarded 44\nscholarships of $500 each. The next year, Big Sky received 90\napplications and awarded 54 scholarships of $500 each. Several\nfamilies, most with incomes of $30,000 or less, used the\nscholarships to send their children to Stillwater Christian. In December 2018, the Montana Supreme Court\nreversed the trial court. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603. The Court\nfirst addressed the scholarship program unmodified by Rule 1,\nholding that the program aided religious schools in violation of\nthe no-aid provision of the Montana Constitution. In the Court’s\nview, the no-aid provision “broadly and strictly prohibits aid to\nsectarian schools.” Id. , at 459, 435 P. 3d, at 609. The\nscholarship program provided such aid by using tax credits to\n“subsidize tuition payments” at private schools that are\n“religiously affiliated” or “controlled in whole or in part by\nchurches.” Id. , at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at 612–613. In\nthat way, the scholarship program flouted the State Constitution’s\n“guarantee to all Montanans that their government will not use\nstate funds to aid religious schools.” Id. , at 467, 435\nP. 3d, at 614. The Montana Supreme Court went on to hold that\nthe violation of the no-aid provision required invalidating the\nentire scholarship program. The Court explained that the program\nprovided “no mechanism” for preventing aid from flowing to\nreligious schools, and therefore the scholarship program could not\n“under any circumstance” be construed as consistent with the\nno-aid provision. Id. , at 466–468, 435 P. 3d, at\n613–614. As a result, the tax credit is no longer available to\nsupport scholarships at either religious or secular private\nschools. The Montana Supreme Court acknowledged that “an\noverly-broad” application of the no-aid provision “could implicate\nfree exercise concerns” and that “there may be a case” where\n“prohibiting the aid would violate the Free Exercise Clause.” Id. , at 468, 435 P. 3d, at 614. But, the Court\nconcluded, “this is not one of those cases.” Ibid. Finally, the Court agreed with petitioners that\nthe Department had exceeded its authority in promulgating\nRule 1. The Court explained that the statute creating the\nscholarship program had broadly defined qualifying schools to\ninclude all private schools, including religious ones, and the\nDepartment lacked authority to “transform” that definition with an\nadministrative rule. Id. , at 468–469, 435 P. 3d, at\n614–615. Several Justices wrote separately. All agreed\nthat Rule 1 was invalid, but they expressed differing views on\nwhether the scholarship program was consistent with the Montana and\nUnited States Constitutions. Justice Gustafson’s concurrence argued\nthat the program violated not only Montana’s no-aid provision but\nalso the Federal Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. Id. , at 475–479, 435 P. 3d, at 619–621. Justice\nSandefur echoed the majority’s conclusion that applying the no-aid\nprovision was consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, and he\ndismissed the “modern jurisprudence” of that Clause as\n“unnecessarily complicate[d]” due to “increasingly value-driven\nhairsplitting and overstretching.” Id. , at 482–484, 435\nP. 3d, at 623–624. Two Justices dissented. Justice Rice would have\nheld that the scholarship program was permissible under the no-aid\nprovision. He criticized the majority for invalidating the program\n“ sua sponte ,” contending that no party had challenged\nit under the State Constitution. Id. , at 495, 435\nP. 3d, at 631. Justice Baker also would have upheld the\nprogram. In her view, the no-aid provision did not bar the use of\nscholarships at religious schools, and free exercise concerns could\narise under the Federal Constitution if it did. Id. , at\n493–494, 435 P. 3d, at 630. We granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___\n(2019). II A The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment\nprovide that “Congress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof.” We have recognized a “ ‘play in the joints’ between what\nthe Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause\ncompels.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Locke v. Davey , 540\nU.S. 712 , 718 (2004)). Here, the parties do not dispute that\nthe scholarship program is permissible under the Establishment\nClause. Nor could they. We have repeatedly held that the\nEstablishment Clause is not offended when religious observers and\norganizations benefit from neutral government programs. See, e.g. , Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S.\n819 , 839 (1995). See also Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (noting the parties’ agreement\nthat the Establishment Clause was not violated by including\nchurches in a playground resurfacing program). Any Establishment\nClause objection to the scholarship program here is particularly\nunavailing because the government support makes its way to\nreligious schools only as a result of Montanans independently\nchoosing to spend their scholarships at such schools. See Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , 536 U.S.\n639 , 649–653 (2002). The Montana Supreme Court, however, held\nas a matter of state law that even such indirect government support\nqualified as “aid” prohibited under the Montana Constitution. The question for this Court is whether the Free\nExercise Clause precluded the Montana Supreme Court from applying\nMontana’s no-aid provision to bar religious schools from the\nscholarship program. For purposes of answering that question, we\naccept the Montana Supreme Court’s interpretation of state\nlaw—including its determination that the scholarship program\nprovided impermissible “aid” within the meaning of the Montana\nConstitution—and we assess whether excluding religious schools and\naffected families from that program was consistent with the Federal\nConstitution.[ 2 ] The Free Exercise Clause, which applies to the\nStates under the Fourteenth Amendment, “protects religious\nobservers against unequal treatment” and against “laws that impose\nspecial disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 9)\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310\nU.S. 296 , 303 (1940). Those “basic principle[s ]” have\nlong guided this Court. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 6–9). See, e.g. , Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U.S.\n1 , 16 (1947) (a State “cannot exclude individual Catholics,\nLutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers,\nPresbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of\ntheir faith, or lack of it , from receiving the benefits of\npublic welfare legislation”); Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , 449 (1988) (the Free Exercise Clause protects against laws\nthat “penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal\nshare of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other\ncitizens”). Most recently, Trinity Lutheran distilled\nthese and other decisions to the same effect into the\n“unremarkable” conclusion that disqualifying otherwise eligible\nrecipients from a public benefit “solely because of their religious\ncharacter” imposes “a penalty on the free exercise of religion that\ntriggers the most exacting scrutiny.” 582 U. S., at ___–___\n(slip op., at 9–10). In Trinity Lutheran , Missouri provided\ngrants to help nonprofit organizations pay for playground\nresurfacing, but a state policy disqualified any organization\n“owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 2). Because of that policy, an\notherwise eligible church-owned preschool was denied a grant to\nresurface its playground. Missouri’s policy discriminated against\nthe Church “simply because of what it is—a church,” and so the\npolicy was subject to the “strictest scrutiny,” which it failed. Id. , at ___–___ (slip op., at 11–15). We acknowledged that\nthe State had not “criminalized” the way in which the Church\nworshipped or “told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a\ncertain view of the Gospel.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 11).\nBut the State’s discriminatory policy was “odious to our\nConstitution all the same.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at\n15). Here too Montana’s no-aid provision bars\nreligious schools from public benefits solely because of the\nreligious character of the schools. The provision also bars parents\nwho wish to send their children to a religious school from those\nsame benefits, again solely because of the religious character of\nthe school. This is apparent from the plain text. The provision\nbars aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination.” Mont. Const., Art. X, §6(1).\nThe provision’s title—“Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools”—confirms that the provision singles out schools based on\ntheir religious character. Ibid. And the Montana Supreme\nCourt explained that the provision forbids aid to any school that\nis “sectarian,” “religiously affiliated,” or “controlled in whole\nor in part by churches.” 393 Mont., at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at\n612–613. The provision plainly excludes schools from government aid\nsolely because of religious status. See Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–10). The Department counters that Trinity\nLutheran does not govern here because the no-aid provision\napplies not because of the religious character of the recipients,\nbut because of how the funds would be used—for “religious\neducation.” Brief for Respondents 38. In Trinity Lutheran , a\nmajority of the Court concluded that the Missouri policy violated\nthe Free Exercise Clause because it discriminated on the basis of\nreligious status. A plurality declined to address discrimination\nwith respect to “religious uses of funding or other forms of\ndiscrimination.” 582 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 14, n.\n3). The plurality saw no need to consider such concerns because\nMissouri had expressly discriminated “based on religious identity,” ibid. , which was enough to invalidate the state policy\nwithout addressing how government funds were used. This case also turns expressly on religious\nstatus and not religious use. The Montana Supreme Court applied the\nno-aid provision solely by reference to religious status. The Court\nrepeatedly explained that the no-aid provision bars aid to “schools\ncontrolled in whole or in part by churches,” “sectarian schools,”\nand “religiously-affiliated schools.” 393 Mont., at 463–467, 435\nP. 3d, at 611–613. Applying this provision to the scholarship\nprogram, the Montana Supreme Court noted that most of the private\nschools that would benefit from the program were “religiously\naffiliated” and “controlled by churches,” and the Court ultimately\nconcluded that the scholarship program ran afoul of the Montana\nConstitution by aiding “schools controlled by churches.” Id. , at 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 613–614. The Montana\nConstitution discriminates based on religious status just like the\nMissouri policy in Trinity Lutheran , which excluded\norganizations “owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other\nreligious entity.” 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). The Department points to some language in the\ndecision below indicating that the no-aid provision has the goal or\neffect of ensuring that government aid does not end up being used\nfor “sectarian education” or “religious education.” 393 Mont., at\n460, 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 609, 613–614. The Department also\ncontrasts what it characterizes as the “completely non-religious”\nbenefit of playground resurfacing in Trinity Lutheran with\nthe unrestricted tuition aid at issue here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.\nGeneral school aid, the Department stresses, could be used for\nreligious ends by some recipients, particularly schools that\nbelieve faith should “ permeate [ ]” everything they do.\nBrief for Respondents 39 (quoting State ex rel. Chambers v. School Dist. No. 10 , 155 Mont. 422, 438, 472 P.2d 1013 , 1021 (1970)). See also post , at 8, 13\n(Breyer, J., dissenting). Regardless, those considerations were not the\nMontana Supreme Court’s basis for applying the no-aid provision to\nexclude religious schools; that hinged solely on religious status.\nStatus-based discrimination remains status based even if one of its\ngoals or effects is preventing religious organizations from putting\naid to religious uses. Undeterred by Trinity Lutheran , the\nMontana Supreme Court applied the no-aid provision to hold that\nreligious schools could not benefit from the scholarship program.\n393 Mont., at 464–468, 435 P. 3d, at 612–614. So applied, the\nprovision “impose[s] special disabilities on the basis of religious\nstatus” and “condition[s] the availability of benefits upon a\nrecipient’s willingness to surrender [its] religiously impelled\nstatus.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 9–10) (quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508\nU.S. 520 , 533 (1993), and McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U.S.\n618 , 626 (1978) (plurality opinion) (alterations omitted)). To\nbe eligible for government aid under the Montana Constitution, a\nschool must divorce itself from any religious control or\naffiliation. Placing such a condition on benefits or privileges\n“inevitably deters or discourages the exercise of First Amendment\nrights.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S.\n398 , 405 (1963) (alterations omitted)). The Free Exercise\nClause protects against even “indirect coercion,” and a State\n“punishe[s] the free exercise of religion” by disqualifying the\nreligious from government aid as Montana did here. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Such status-based\ndiscrimination is subject to “the strictest scrutiny.” Id. ,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). None of this is meant to suggest that we agree\nwith the Department, Brief for Respondents 36–40, that some lesser\ndegree of scrutiny applies to discrimination against religious uses\nof government aid. See Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546\n(striking down law designed to ban religious practice involving\nalleged animal cruelty, explaining that a law “target[ing]\nreligious conduct for distinctive treatment or advanc[ing]\nlegitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a\nreligious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare\ncases”). Some Members of the Court, moreover, have questioned\nwhether there is a meaningful distinction between discrimination\nbased on use or conduct and that based on status. See Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2)\n(Gorsuch, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in part) (citing, e.g. , Lukumi , 508 U.S.\n520 , and Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment\nSecurity Div. , 450 U.S.\n707 (1981)). We acknowledge the point but need not examine it\nhere. It is enough in this case to conclude that strict scrutiny\napplies under Trinity Lutheran because Montana’s no-aid\nprovision discriminates based on religious status. B Seeking to avoid Trinity Lutheran , the\nDepartment contends that this case is instead governed by Locke v. Davey , 540 U.S.\n712 (2004). See also post , at 5 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting); post , at 9 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Locke also involved a scholarship program. The State of\nWashington provided scholarships paid out of the State’s general\nfund to help students pursuing postsecondary education. The\nscholarships could be used at accredited religious and nonreligious\nschools alike, but Washington prohibited students from using the\nscholarships to pursue devotional theology degrees, which prepared\nstudents for a calling as clergy. This prohibition prevented Davey\nfrom using his scholarship to obtain a degree that would have\nenabled him to become a pastor. We held that Washington had not\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. Locke differs from this case in two\ncritical ways. First, Locke explained that Washington had\n“merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction”: the\n“essentially religious endeavor” of training a minister “to lead a\ncongregation.” Id. , at 721. Thus, Davey “was denied a\nscholarship because of what he proposed to do —use the funds\nto prepare for the ministry.” Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Apart from that narrow\nrestriction, Washington’s program allowed scholarships to be used\nat “pervasively religious schools” that incorporated religious\ninstruction throughout their classes. Locke , 540 U. S.,\nat 724–725. By contrast, Montana’s Constitution does not zero in on\nany particular “essentially religious” course of instruction at a\nreligious school. Rather, as we have explained, the no-aid\nprovision bars all aid to a religious school “simply because of\nwhat it is,” putting the school to a choice between being religious\nor receiving government benefits. Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). At the same time, the\nprovision puts families to a choice between sending their children\nto a religious school or receiving such benefits. Second, Locke invoked a “historic and\nsubstantial” state interest in not funding the training of clergy,\n540 U. S., at 725, explaining that “opposition to\n. . . funding ‘to support church leaders’ lay at the\nhistoric core of the Religion Clauses,” Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting Locke , 540\nU. S., at 722). As evidence of that tradition, the Court in Locke emphasized that the propriety of state-supported\nclergy was a central subject of founding-era debates, and that most\nstate constitutions from that era prohibited the expenditure of tax\ndollars to support the clergy. See id. , at 722–723. But no comparable “historic and substantial”\ntradition supports Montana’s decision to disqualify religious\nschools from government aid. In the founding era and the early 19th\ncentury, governments provided financial support to private schools,\nincluding denominational ones. “Far from prohibiting such support,\nthe early state constitutions and statutes actively encouraged this\npolicy.” L. Jorgenson, The State and the Non-Public School,\n1825–1925, p. 4 (1987); e.g., R. Gabel, Public Funds for\nChurch and Private Schools 210, 217–218, 221, 241–243 (1937); C.\nKaestle, Pillars of the Republic: Common Schools and American\nSociety, 1760–1860, pp. 166–167 (1983). Local governments provided\ngrants to private schools, including religious ones, for the\neducation of the poor. M. McConnell, et al., Religion and the\nConstitution 318–319 (4th ed. 2016). Even States with bans on\ngovernment-supported clergy, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\nGeorgia, provided various forms of aid to religious schools.\n See Kaestle, supra , at 166–167; Gabel, supra ,\nat 215–218, 241–245, 372–374; cf. Locke , 540 U. S., at\n723. Early federal aid (often land grants) went to religious\nschools. McConnell, supra , at 319. Congress provided support\nto denominational schools in the District of Columbia until 1848, ibid. , and Congress paid churches to run schools for\nAmerican Indians through the end of the 19th century, see Quick\nBear v. Leupp , 210 U.S.\n50 , 78 (1908); Gabel, supra , at 521–523. After the Civil\nWar, Congress spent large sums on education for emancipated\nfreedmen, often by supporting denominational schools in the South\nthrough the Freedmen’s Bureau. McConnell, supra , at\n323.[ 3 ] The Department argues that a tradition against state support for religious schools arose in the\nsecond half of the 19th century, as more than 30 States—including\nMontana—adopted no-aid provisions. See Brief for Respondents 40–42\nand App. D. Such a development, of course, cannot by itself\nestablish an early American tradition. Justice Sotomayor questions\nour reliance on aid provided during the same era by the Freedmen’s\nBureau, post , at 10 (dissenting opinion), but we see no\ninconsistency in recognizing that such evidence may reinforce an\nearly practice but cannot create one. In addition, many of the\nno-aid provisions belong to a more checkered tradition shared with\nthe Blaine Amendment of the 1870s. That proposal—which Congress\nnearly passed—would have added to the Federal Constitution a\nprovision similar to the state no-aid provisions, prohibiting\n",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus ESPINOZA et al. v . MONTANA\nDEPARTMENT OF REVENUE et al. certiorari to the supreme court of montana No. 18–1195. Argued January 22, 2020—Decided\nJune 30, 2020 The Montana Legislature established a program\nthat grants tax credits to those who donate to organizations that\naward scholarships for private school tuition. To reconcile the\nprogram with a provision of the Montana Constitution that bars\ngovernment aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination,” Art. X, §6(1), the Montana\nDepartment of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,” which prohibited\nfamilies from using the scholarships at religious schools. Three\nmothers who were blocked by Rule 1 from using scholarship funds for\ntheir children’s tuition at Stillwater Christian School sued the\nDepartment in state court, alleging that the Rule discriminated on\nthe basis of their religious views and the religious nature of the\nschool they had chosen. The trial court enjoined Rule 1. Reversing,\nthe Montana Supreme Court held that the program, unmodified by Rule\n1, aided religious schools in violation of the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. The Court further held that the\nviolation required invalidating the entire program. Held : The application of the\nno-aid provision discriminated against religious schools and the\nfamilies whose children attend or hope to attend them in violation\nof the Free Exercise Clause of the Federal Constitution.\nPp. 6–22. (a) The Free Exercise Clause “protects\nreligious observers against unequal treatment” and against “laws\nthat impose special disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer ,\n582 U. S. ___, ___. In Trinity Lutheran , this Court\nheld that disqualifying otherwise eligible recipients from a public\nbenefit “solely because of their religious character” imposes “a\npenalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most\nexacting scrutiny.” Id. , at ___. Here, the application of\nMontana’s no-aid provision excludes religious schools from public\nbenefits solely because of religious status. As a result, strict\nscrutiny applies. Pp. 6–12. (b) Contrary to the Department’s\ncontention, this case is not governed by Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S.\n712 . The plaintiff in Locke was denied a scholarship\n“because of what he proposed to do —use the funds to prepare\nfor the ministry,” an essentially religious endeavor. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. By contrast, Montana’s no-aid\nprovision does not zero in on any essentially religious course of\ninstruction but rather bars aid to a religious school “simply\nbecause of what it is”—a religious school. Id. , at ___. Locke also invoked a “historic and substantial” state\ninterest in not funding the training of clergy, 540 U. S., at\n725, but no comparable tradition supports Montana’s decision to\ndisqualify religious schools from government aid.\nPp. 12–16. (c) The proposed alternative approach\ninvolving a flexible case-by-case analysis is inconsistent with Trinity Lutheran . The protections of the Free Exercise\nClause do not depend on a varying case-by-case analysis regarding\nwhether discrimination against religious adherents would serve\nill-defined interests. Pp. 16–18. (d) To satisfy strict scrutiny, government\naction “must advance ‘interests of the highest order’ and must be\nnarrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.” Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546. Montana’s interest in creating greater separation of\nchurch and State than the Federal Constitution requires “cannot\nqualify as compelling” in the face of the infringement of free\nexercise here. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. The\nDepartment’s argument that the no-aid provision actually promotes\nreligious freedom is unavailing because an infringement of First\nAmendment rights cannot be justified by a State’s alternative view\nthat the infringement advances religious liberty. The Department’s\nargument is especially unconvincing because the infringement here\nbroadly burdens not only religious schools but also the families\nwhose children attend them. The Department suggests that the no-aid\nprovision safeguards public education by ensuring that government\nsupport is not diverted to private schools, but that interest does\nnot justify a no-aid provision that requires only religious private\nschools to bear its weight. Pp. 18–20. (e) Because the Free Exercise Clause\nbarred the application of the no-aid provision here, the Montana\nSupreme Court had no authority to invalidate the program on the\nbasis of that provision. The Department argues that the\ninvalidation of the entire program prevented a free exercise\nviolation, but the Department overlooks the Montana Supreme Court’s\nthreshold error of federal law. Had the Montana Supreme Court\nrecognized that the application of the no-aid provision was barred\nby the Free Exercise Clause, the Court would have had no basis for\ninvalidating the program. The Court was obligated to disregard the\nno-aid provision and decide this case consistent with the Federal\nConstitution. Pp. 20–22. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603, reversed and\nremanded. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, in which Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ.,\njoined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Gorsuch,\nJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 18–1195 _________________ KENDRA ESPINOZA, et al., PETITIONERS v. MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, et al. on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmontana [June 30, 2020] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. The Montana Legislature established a program to\nprovide tuition assistance to parents who send their children to\nprivate schools. The program grants a tax credit to anyone who\ndonates to certain organizations that in turn award scholarships to\nselected students attending such schools. When petitioners sought\nto use the scholarships at a religious school, the Montana Supreme\nCourt struck down the program. The Court relied on the “no-aid”\nprovision of the State Constitution, which prohibits any aid to a\nschool controlled by a “church, sect, or denomination.” The\nquestion presented is whether the Free Exercise Clause of the\nUnited States Constitution barred that application of the no-aid\nprovision. I A In 2015, the Montana Legislature sought “to\nprovide parental and student choice in education” by enacting a\nscholarship program for students attending private schools. 2015\nMont. Laws p. 2168, §7. The program grants a tax credit of up to\n$150 to any taxpayer who donates to a participating “student\nscholarship organization.” Mont. Code Ann. §§15–30–3103(1),\n–3111(1) (2019). The scholarship organizations then use the\ndonations to award scholarships to children for tuition at a\nprivate school. §§15–30–3102(7)(a), –3103(1)(c).[ 1 ] So far only one scholarship organization, Big\nSky Scholarships, has participated in the program. Big Sky focuses\non providing scholarships to families who face financial hardship\nor have children with disabilities. Scholarship organizations like\nBig Sky must, among other requirements, maintain an application\nprocess for awarding the scholarships; use at least 90% of all\ndonations on scholarship awards; and comply with state reporting\nand monitoring requirements. §§15–30–3103(1), –3105(1),\n–3113(1). A family whose child is awarded a scholarship\nunder the program may use it at any “qualified education\nprovider”—that is, any private school that meets certain\naccreditation, testing, and safety requirements. See\n§15–30–3102(7). Virtually every private school in Montana\nqualifies. Upon receiving a scholarship, the family designates its\nschool of choice, and the scholarship organization sends the\nscholarship funds directly to the school. §15–30–3104(1). Neither\nthe scholarship organization nor its donors can restrict awards to\nparticular types of schools. See §§15–30–3103(1)(b), –3111(1). The Montana Legislature allotted $3 million\nannually to fund the tax credits, beginning in 2016.\n§15–30–3111(5)(a). If the annual allotment is exhausted, it\nincreases by 10% the following year. Ibid. The program is\nslated to expire in 2023. 2015 Mont. Laws p. 2186, §33. The Montana Legislature also directed that the\nprogram be administered in accordance with Article X, section 6, of\nthe Montana Constitution, which contains a “no-aid” provision\nbarring government aid to sectarian schools. See Mont. Code Ann.\n§15–30–3101. In full, that provision states: “ Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools . . . . The legislature, counties, cities, towns,\nschool districts, and public corporations shall not make any direct\nor indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or\nmonies, or any grant of lands or other property for any sectarian\npurpose or to aid any church, school, academy, seminary, college,\nuniversity, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled\nin whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.” Mont.\nConst., Art. X, §6(1). Shortly after the scholarship program was\ncreated, the Montana Department of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,”\nover the objection of the Montana Attorney General. That\nadministrative rule prohibited families from using scholarships at\nreligious schools. Mont. Admin. Rule §42.4.802(1)(a) (2015). It did\nso by changing the definition of “qualified education provider” to\nexclude any school “owned or controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, religious sect, or denomination.” Ibid. The\nDepartment explained that the Rule was needed to reconcile the\nscholarship program with the no-aid provision of the Montana\nConstitution. The Montana Attorney General disagreed. In a\nletter to the Department, he advised that the Montana Constitution\ndid not require excluding religious schools from the program, and\nif it did, it would “very likely” violate the United States\nConstitution by discriminating against the schools and their\nstudents. See Complaint in No. DV–15–1152A (Dist. Ct. Flathead\nCty.), Exh. 3, pp. 2, 5–6. The Attorney General is not representing\nthe Department in this case. B This suit was brought by three mothers whose\nchildren attend Stillwater Christian School in northwestern\nMontana. Stillwater is a private Christian school that meets the\nstatutory criteria for “qualified education providers.” It serves\nstudents in prekindergarten through 12th grade, and petitioners\nchose the school in large part because it “teaches the same\nChristian values that [they] teach at home.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n152; see id. , at 138, 167. The child of one petitioner has\nalready received scholarships from Big Sky, and the other\npetitioners’ children are eligible for scholarships and planned to\napply. While in effect, however, Rule 1 blocked petitioners from\nusing scholarship funds for tuition at Stillwater. To overcome that\nobstacle, petitioners sued the Department of Revenue in Montana\nstate court. Petitioners claimed that Rule 1 conflicted with the\nstatute that created the scholarship program and could not be\njustified on the ground that it was compelled by the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. Petitioners further alleged that\nthe Rule discriminated on the basis of their religious views and\nthe religious nature of the school they had chosen for their\nchildren. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, holding that it\nwas based on a mistake of law. The court explained that the Rule\nwas not required by the no-aid provision, because that provision\nprohibits only “appropriations” that aid religious schools, “not\ntax credits.” Id. , at 94. The injunctive relief freed Big Sky to award\nscholarships to students regardless of whether they attended a\nreligious or secular school. For the school year beginning in fall\n2017, Big Sky received 59 applications and ultimately awarded 44\nscholarships of $500 each. The next year, Big Sky received 90\napplications and awarded 54 scholarships of $500 each. Several\nfamilies, most with incomes of $30,000 or less, used the\nscholarships to send their children to Stillwater Christian. In December 2018, the Montana Supreme Court\nreversed the trial court. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603. The Court\nfirst addressed the scholarship program unmodified by Rule 1,\nholding that the program aided religious schools in violation of\nthe no-aid provision of the Montana Constitution. In the Court’s\nview, the no-aid provision “broadly and strictly prohibits aid to\nsectarian schools.” Id. , at 459, 435 P. 3d, at 609. The\nscholarship program provided such aid by using tax credits to\n“subsidize tuition payments” at private schools that are\n“religiously affiliated” or “controlled in whole or in part by\nchurches.” Id. , at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at 612–613. In\nthat way, the scholarship program flouted the State Constitution’s\n“guarantee to all Montanans that their government will not use\nstate funds to aid religious schools.” Id. , at 467, 435\nP. 3d, at 614. The Montana Supreme Court went on to hold that\nthe violation of the no-aid provision required invalidating the\nentire scholarship program. The Court explained that the program\nprovided “no mechanism” for preventing aid from flowing to\nreligious schools, and therefore the scholarship program could not\n“under any circumstance” be construed as consistent with the\nno-aid provision. Id. , at 466–468, 435 P. 3d, at\n613–614. As a result, the tax credit is no longer available to\nsupport scholarships at either religious or secular private\nschools. The Montana Supreme Court acknowledged that “an\noverly-broad” application of the no-aid provision “could implicate\nfree exercise concerns” and that “there may be a case” where\n“prohibiting the aid would violate the Free Exercise Clause.” Id. , at 468, 435 P. 3d, at 614. But, the Court\nconcluded, “this is not one of those cases.” Ibid. Finally, the Court agreed with petitioners that\nthe Department had exceeded its authority in promulgating\nRule 1. The Court explained that the statute creating the\nscholarship program had broadly defined qualifying schools to\ninclude all private schools, including religious ones, and the\nDepartment lacked authority to “transform” that definition with an\nadministrative rule. Id. , at 468–469, 435 P. 3d, at\n614–615. Several Justices wrote separately. All agreed\nthat Rule 1 was invalid, but they expressed differing views on\nwhether the scholarship program was consistent with the Montana and\nUnited States Constitutions. Justice Gustafson’s concurrence argued\nthat the program violated not only Montana’s no-aid provision but\nalso the Federal Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. Id. , at 475–479, 435 P. 3d, at 619–621. Justice\nSandefur echoed the majority’s conclusion that applying the no-aid\nprovision was consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, and he\ndismissed the “modern jurisprudence” of that Clause as\n“unnecessarily complicate[d]” due to “increasingly value-driven\nhairsplitting and overstretching.” Id. , at 482–484, 435\nP. 3d, at 623–624. Two Justices dissented. Justice Rice would have\nheld that the scholarship program was permissible under the no-aid\nprovision. He criticized the majority for invalidating the program\n“ sua sponte ,” contending that no party had challenged\nit under the State Constitution. Id. , at 495, 435\nP. 3d, at 631. Justice Baker also would have upheld the\nprogram. In her view, the no-aid provision did not bar the use of\nscholarships at religious schools, and free exercise concerns could\narise under the Federal Constitution if it did. Id. , at\n493–494, 435 P. 3d, at 630. We granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___\n(2019). II A The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment\nprovide that “Congress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof.” We have recognized a “ ‘play in the joints’ between what\nthe Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause\ncompels.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Locke v. Davey , 540\nU.S. 712 , 718 (2004)). Here, the parties do not dispute that\nthe scholarship program is permissible under the Establishment\nClause. Nor could they. We have repeatedly held that the\nEstablishment Clause is not offended when religious observers and\norganizations benefit from neutral government programs. See, e.g. , Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S.\n819 , 839 (1995). See also Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (noting the parties’ agreement\nthat the Establishment Clause was not violated by including\nchurches in a playground resurfacing program). Any Establishment\nClause objection to the scholarship program here is particularly\nunavailing because the government support makes its way to\nreligious schools only as a result of Montanans independently\nchoosing to spend their scholarships at such schools. See Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , 536 U.S.\n639 , 649–653 (2002). The Montana Supreme Court, however, held\nas a matter of state law that even such indirect government support\nqualified as “aid” prohibited under the Montana Constitution. The question for this Court is whether the Free\nExercise Clause precluded the Montana Supreme Court from applying\nMontana’s no-aid provision to bar religious schools from the\nscholarship program. For purposes of answering that question, we\naccept the Montana Supreme Court’s interpretation of state\nlaw—including its determination that the scholarship program\nprovided impermissible “aid” within the meaning of the Montana\nConstitution—and we assess whether excluding religious schools and\naffected families from that program was consistent with the Federal\nConstitution.[ 2 ] The Free Exercise Clause, which applies to the\nStates under the Fourteenth Amendment, “protects religious\nobservers against unequal treatment” and against “laws that impose\nspecial disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 9)\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310\nU.S. 296 , 303 (1940). Those “basic principle[s ]” have\nlong guided this Court. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 6–9). See, e.g. , Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U.S.\n1 , 16 (1947) (a State “cannot exclude individual Catholics,\nLutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers,\nPresbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of\ntheir faith, or lack of it , from receiving the benefits of\npublic welfare legislation”); Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , 449 (1988) (the Free Exercise Clause protects against laws\nthat “penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal\nshare of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other\ncitizens”). Most recently, Trinity Lutheran distilled\nthese and other decisions to the same effect into the\n“unremarkable” conclusion that disqualifying otherwise eligible\nrecipients from a public benefit “solely because of their religious\ncharacter” imposes “a penalty on the free exercise of religion that\ntriggers the most exacting scrutiny.” 582 U. S., at ___–___\n(slip op., at 9–10). In Trinity Lutheran , Missouri provided\ngrants to help nonprofit organizations pay for playground\nresurfacing, but a state policy disqualified any organization\n“owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 2). Because of that policy, an\notherwise eligible church-owned preschool was denied a grant to\nresurface its playground. Missouri’s policy discriminated against\nthe Church “simply because of what it is—a church,” and so the\npolicy was subject to the “strictest scrutiny,” which it failed. Id. , at ___–___ (slip op., at 11–15). We acknowledged that\nthe State had not “criminalized” the way in which the Church\nworshipped or “told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a\ncertain view of the Gospel.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 11).\nBut the State’s discriminatory policy was “odious to our\nConstitution all the same.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at\n15). Here too Montana’s no-aid provision bars\nreligious schools from public benefits solely because of the\nreligious character of the schools. The provision also bars parents\nwho wish to send their children to a religious school from those\nsame benefits, again solely because of the religious character of\nthe school. This is apparent from the plain text. The provision\nbars aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination.” Mont. Const., Art. X, §6(1).\nThe provision’s title—“Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools”—confirms that the provision singles out schools based on\ntheir religious character. Ibid. And the Montana Supreme\nCourt explained that the provision forbids aid to any school that\nis “sectarian,” “religiously affiliated,” or “controlled in whole\nor in part by churches.” 393 Mont., at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at\n612–613. The provision plainly excludes schools from government aid\nsolely because of religious status. See Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–10). The Department counters that Trinity\nLutheran does not govern here because the no-aid provision\napplies not because of the religious character of the recipients,\nbut because of how the funds would be used—for “religious\neducation.” Brief for Respondents 38. In Trinity Lutheran , a\nmajority of the Court concluded that the Missouri policy violated\nthe Free Exercise Clause because it discriminated on the basis of\nreligious status. A plurality declined to address discrimination\nwith respect to “religious uses of funding or other forms of\ndiscrimination.” 582 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 14, n.\n3). The plurality saw no need to consider such concerns because\nMissouri had expressly discriminated “based on religious identity,” ibid. , which was enough to invalidate the state policy\nwithout addressing how government funds were used. This case also turns expressly on religious\nstatus and not religious use. The Montana Supreme Court applied the\nno-aid provision solely by reference to religious status. The Court\nrepeatedly explained that the no-aid provision bars aid to “schools\ncontrolled in whole or in part by churches,” “sectarian schools,”\nand “religiously-affiliated schools.” 393 Mont., at 463–467, 435\nP. 3d, at 611–613. Applying this provision to the scholarship\nprogram, the Montana Supreme Court noted that most of the private\nschools that would benefit from the program were “religiously\naffiliated” and “controlled by churches,” and the Court ultimately\nconcluded that the scholarship program ran afoul of the Montana\nConstitution by aiding “schools controlled by churches.” Id. , at 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 613–614. The Montana\nConstitution discriminates based on religious status just like the\nMissouri policy in Trinity Lutheran , which excluded\norganizations “owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other\nreligious entity.” 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). The Department points to some language in the\ndecision below indicating that the no-aid provision has the goal or\neffect of ensuring that government aid does not end up being used\nfor “sectarian education” or “religious education.” 393 Mont., at\n460, 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 609, 613–614. The Department also\ncontrasts what it characterizes as the “completely non-religious”\nbenefit of playground resurfacing in Trinity Lutheran with\nthe unrestricted tuition aid at issue here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.\nGeneral school aid, the Department stresses, could be used for\nreligious ends by some recipients, particularly schools that\nbelieve faith should “ permeate [ ]” everything they do.\nBrief for Respondents 39 (quoting State ex rel. Chambers v. School Dist. No. 10 , 155 Mont. 422, 438, 472 P.2d 1013 , 1021 (1970)). See also post , at 8, 13\n(Breyer, J., dissenting). Regardless, those considerations were not the\nMontana Supreme Court’s basis for applying the no-aid provision to\nexclude religious schools; that hinged solely on religious status.\nStatus-based discrimination remains status based even if one of its\ngoals or effects is preventing religious organizations from putting\naid to religious uses. Undeterred by Trinity Lutheran , the\nMontana Supreme Court applied the no-aid provision to hold that\nreligious schools could not benefit from the scholarship program.\n393 Mont., at 464–468, 435 P. 3d, at 612–614. So applied, the\nprovision “impose[s] special disabilities on the basis of religious\nstatus” and “condition[s] the availability of benefits upon a\nrecipient’s willingness to surrender [its] religiously impelled\nstatus.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 9–10) (quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508\nU.S. 520 , 533 (1993), and McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U.S.\n618 , 626 (1978) (plurality opinion) (alterations omitted)). To\nbe eligible for government aid under the Montana Constitution, a\nschool must divorce itself from any religious control or\naffiliation. Placing such a condition on benefits or privileges\n“inevitably deters or discourages the exercise of First Amendment\nrights.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S.\n398 , 405 (1963) (alterations omitted)). The Free Exercise\nClause protects against even “indirect coercion,” and a State\n“punishe[s] the free exercise of religion” by disqualifying the\nreligious from government aid as Montana did here. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Such status-based\ndiscrimination is subject to “the strictest scrutiny.” Id. ,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). None of this is meant to suggest that we agree\nwith the Department, Brief for Respondents 36–40, that some lesser\ndegree of scrutiny applies to discrimination against religious uses\nof government aid. See Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546\n(striking down law designed to ban religious practice involving\nalleged animal cruelty, explaining that a law “target[ing]\nreligious conduct for distinctive treatment or advanc[ing]\nlegitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a\nreligious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare\ncases”). Some Members of the Court, moreover, have questioned\nwhether there is a meaningful distinction between discrimination\nbased on use or conduct and that based on status. See Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2)\n(Gorsuch, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in part) (citing, e.g. , Lukumi , 508 U.S.\n520 , and Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment\nSecurity Div. , 450 U.S.\n707 (1981)). We acknowledge the point but need not examine it\nhere. It is enough in this case to conclude that strict scrutiny\napplies under Trinity Lutheran because Montana’s no-aid\nprovision discriminates based on religious status. B Seeking to avoid Trinity Lutheran , the\nDepartment contends that this case is instead governed by Locke v. Davey , 540 U.S.\n712 (2004). See also post , at 5 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting); post , at 9 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Locke also involved a scholarship program. The State of\nWashington provided scholarships paid out of the State’s general\nfund to help students pursuing postsecondary education. The\nscholarships could be used at accredited religious and nonreligious\nschools alike, but Washington prohibited students from using the\nscholarships to pursue devotional theology degrees, which prepared\nstudents for a calling as clergy. This prohibition prevented Davey\nfrom using his scholarship to obtain a degree that would have\nenabled him to become a pastor. We held that Washington had not\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. Locke differs from this case in two\ncritical ways. First, Locke explained that Washington had\n“merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction”: the\n“essentially religious endeavor” of training a minister “to lead a\ncongregation.” Id. , at 721. Thus, Davey “was denied a\nscholarship because of what he proposed to do —use the funds\nto prepare for the ministry.” Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Apart from that narrow\nrestriction, Washington’s program allowed scholarships to be used\nat “pervasively religious schools” that incorporated religious\ninstruction throughout their classes. Locke , 540 U. S.,\nat 724–725. By contrast, Montana’s Constitution does not zero in on\nany particular “essentially religious” course of instruction at a\nreligious school. Rather, as we have explained, the no-aid\nprovision bars all aid to a religious school “simply because of\nwhat it is,” putting the school to a choice between being religious\nor receiving government benefits. Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). At the same time, the\nprovision puts families to a choice between sending their children\nto a religious school or receiving such benefits. Second, Locke invoked a “historic and\nsubstantial” state interest in not funding the training of clergy,\n540 U. S., at 725, explaining that “opposition to\n. . . funding ‘to support church leaders’ lay at the\nhistoric core of the Religion Clauses,” Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting Locke , 540\nU. S., at 722). As evidence of that tradition, the Court in Locke emphasized that the propriety of state-supported\nclergy was a central subject of founding-era debates, and that most\nstate constitutions from that era prohibited the expenditure of tax\ndollars to support the clergy. See id. , at 722–723. But no comparable “historic and substantial”\ntradition supports Montana’s decision to disqualify religious\nschools from government aid. In the founding era and the early 19th\ncentury, governments provided financial support to private schools,\nincluding denominational ones. “Far from prohibiting such support,\nthe early state constitutions and statutes actively encouraged this\npolicy.” L. Jorgenson, The State and the Non-Public School,\n1825–1925, p. 4 (1987); e.g., R. Gabel, Public Funds for\nChurch and Private Schools 210, 217–218, 221, 241–243 (1937); C.\nKaestle, Pillars of the Republic: Common Schools and American\nSociety, 1760–1860, pp. 166–167 (1983). Local governments provided\ngrants to private schools, including religious ones, for the\neducation of the poor. M. McConnell, et al., Religion and the\nConstitution 318–319 (4th ed. 2016). Even States with bans on\ngovernment-supported clergy, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\nGeorgia, provided various forms of aid to religious schools.\n See Kaestle, supra , at 166–167; Gabel, supra ,\nat 215–218, 241–245, 372–374; cf. Locke , 540 U. S., at\n723. Early federal aid (often land grants) went to religious\nschools. McConnell, supra , at 319. Congress provided support\nto denominational schools in the District of Columbia until 1848, ibid. , and Congress paid churches to run schools for\nAmerican Indians through the end of the 19th century, see Quick\nBear v. Leupp , 210 U.S.\n50 , 78 (1908); Gabel, supra , at 521–523. After the Civil\nWar, Congress spent large sums on education for emancipated\nfreedmen, often by supporting denominational schools in the South\nthrough the Freedmen’s Bureau. McConnell, supra , at\n323.[ 3 ] The Department argues that a tradition against state support for religious schools arose in the\nsecond half of the 19th century, as more than 30 States—including\nMontana—adopted no-aid provisions. See Brief for Respondents 40–42\nand App. D. Such a development, of course, cannot by itself\nestablish an early American tradition. Justice Sotomayor questions\nour reliance on aid provided during the same era by the Freedmen’s\nBureau, post , at 10 (dissenting opinion), but we see no\ninconsistency in recognizing that such evidence may reinforce an\nearly practice but cannot create one. In addition, many of the\nno-aid provisions belong to a more checkered tradition shared with\nthe Blaine Amendment of the 1870s. That proposal—which Congress\nnearly passed—would have added to the Federal Constitution a\nprovision similar to the state no-aid provisions, prohibiting\n",

MONTANA\nDEPARTMENT OF REVENUE et al. certiorari to the supreme court of montana No. 18–1195. Argued January 22, 2020—Decided\nJune 30, 2020 The Montana Legislature established a program\nthat grants tax credits to those who donate to organizations that\naward scholarships for private school tuition. To reconcile the\nprogram with a provision of the Montana Constitution that bars\ngovernment aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination,” Art. X, §6(1), the Montana\nDepartment of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,” which prohibited\nfamilies from using the scholarships at religious schools. Three\nmothers who were blocked by Rule 1 from using scholarship funds for\ntheir children’s tuition at Stillwater Christian School sued the\nDepartment in state court, alleging that the Rule discriminated on\nthe basis of their religious views and the religious nature of the\nschool they had chosen. The trial court enjoined Rule 1. Reversing,\nthe Montana Supreme Court held that the program, unmodified by Rule\n1, aided religious schools in violation of the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. The Court further held that the\nviolation required invalidating the entire program. Held : The application of the\nno-aid provision discriminated against religious schools and the\nfamilies whose children attend or hope to attend them in violation\nof the Free Exercise Clause of the Federal Constitution.\nPp. 6–22. (a) The Free Exercise Clause “protects\nreligious observers against unequal treatment” and against “laws\nthat impose special disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer ,\n582 U. S. ___, ___. In Trinity Lutheran , this Court\nheld that disqualifying otherwise eligible recipients from a public\nbenefit “solely because of their religious character” imposes “a\npenalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most\nexacting scrutiny.” Id. , at ___. Here, the application of\nMontana’s no-aid provision excludes religious schools from public\nbenefits solely because of religious status. As a result, strict\nscrutiny applies. Pp. 6–12. (b) Contrary to the Department’s\ncontention, this case is not governed by Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S.\n712 . The plaintiff in Locke was denied a scholarship\n“because of what he proposed to do —use the funds to prepare\nfor the ministry,” an essentially religious endeavor. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. By contrast, Montana’s no-aid\nprovision does not zero in on any essentially religious course of\ninstruction but rather bars aid to a religious school “simply\nbecause of what it is”—a religious school. Id. , at ___. Locke also invoked a “historic and substantial” state\ninterest in not funding the training of clergy, 540 U. S., at\n725, but no comparable tradition supports Montana’s decision to\ndisqualify religious schools from government aid.\nPp. 12–16. (c) The proposed alternative approach\ninvolving a flexible case-by-case analysis is inconsistent with Trinity Lutheran . The protections of the Free Exercise\nClause do not depend on a varying case-by-case analysis regarding\nwhether discrimination against religious adherents would serve\nill-defined interests. Pp. 16–18. (d) To satisfy strict scrutiny, government\naction “must advance ‘interests of the highest order’ and must be\nnarrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.” Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546. Montana’s interest in creating greater separation of\nchurch and State than the Federal Constitution requires “cannot\nqualify as compelling” in the face of the infringement of free\nexercise here. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. The\nDepartment’s argument that the no-aid provision actually promotes\nreligious freedom is unavailing because an infringement of First\nAmendment rights cannot be justified by a State’s alternative view\nthat the infringement advances religious liberty. The Department’s\nargument is especially unconvincing because the infringement here\nbroadly burdens not only religious schools but also the families\nwhose children attend them. The Department suggests that the no-aid\nprovision safeguards public education by ensuring that government\nsupport is not diverted to private schools, but that interest does\nnot justify a no-aid provision that requires only religious private\nschools to bear its weight. Pp. 18–20. (e) Because the Free Exercise Clause\nbarred the application of the no-aid provision here, the Montana\nSupreme Court had no authority to invalidate the program on the\nbasis of that provision. The Department argues that the\ninvalidation of the entire program prevented a free exercise\nviolation, but the Department overlooks the Montana Supreme Court’s\nthreshold error of federal law. Had the Montana Supreme Court\nrecognized that the application of the no-aid provision was barred\nby the Free Exercise Clause, the Court would have had no basis for\ninvalidating the program. The Court was obligated to disregard the\nno-aid provision and decide this case consistent with the Federal\nConstitution. Pp. 20–22. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603, reversed and\nremanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 18–1195 _________________ KENDRA ESPINOZA, et al., PETITIONERS v. MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, et al. on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmontana [June 30, 2020] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. The Montana Legislature established a program to\nprovide tuition assistance to parents who send their children to\nprivate schools. The program grants a tax credit to anyone who\ndonates to certain organizations that in turn award scholarships to\nselected students attending such schools. When petitioners sought\nto use the scholarships at a religious school, the Montana Supreme\nCourt struck down the program. The Court relied on the “no-aid”\nprovision of the State Constitution, which prohibits any aid to a\nschool controlled by a “church, sect, or denomination.” The\nquestion presented is whether the Free Exercise Clause of the\nUnited States Constitution barred that application of the no-aid\nprovision. I A In 2015, the Montana Legislature sought “to\nprovide parental and student choice in education” by enacting a\nscholarship program for students attending private schools. 2015\nMont. Laws p. 2168, §7. The program grants a tax credit of up to\n$150 to any taxpayer who donates to a participating “student\nscholarship organization.” Mont. Code Ann. §§15–30–3103(1),\n–3111(1) (2019). The scholarship organizations then use the\ndonations to award scholarships to children for tuition at a\nprivate school. §§15–30–3102(7)(a), –3103(1)(c).[ 1 ] So far only one scholarship organization, Big\nSky Scholarships, has participated in the program. Big Sky focuses\non providing scholarships to families who face financial hardship\nor have children with disabilities. Scholarship organizations like\nBig Sky must, among other requirements, maintain an application\nprocess for awarding the scholarships; use at least 90% of all\ndonations on scholarship awards; and comply with state reporting\nand monitoring requirements. §§15–30–3103(1), –3105(1),\n–3113(1). A family whose child is awarded a scholarship\nunder the program may use it at any “qualified education\nprovider”—that is, any private school that meets certain\naccreditation, testing, and safety requirements. See\n§15–30–3102(7). Virtually every private school in Montana\nqualifies. Upon receiving a scholarship, the family designates its\nschool of choice, and the scholarship organization sends the\nscholarship funds directly to the school. §15–30–3104(1). Neither\nthe scholarship organization nor its donors can restrict awards to\nparticular types of schools. See §§15–30–3103(1)(b), –3111(1). The Montana Legislature allotted $3 million\nannually to fund the tax credits, beginning in 2016.\n§15–30–3111(5)(a). If the annual allotment is exhausted, it\nincreases by 10% the following year. Ibid. The program is\nslated to expire in 2023. 2015 Mont. Laws p. 2186, §33. The Montana Legislature also directed that the\nprogram be administered in accordance with Article X, section 6, of\nthe Montana Constitution, which contains a “no-aid” provision\nbarring government aid to sectarian schools. See Mont. Code Ann.\n§15–30–3101. In full, that provision states: “ Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools . . . . The legislature, counties, cities, towns,\nschool districts, and public corporations shall not make any direct\nor indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or\nmonies, or any grant of lands or other property for any sectarian\npurpose or to aid any church, school, academy, seminary, college,\nuniversity, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled\nin whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.” Mont.\nConst., Art. X, §6(1). Shortly after the scholarship program was\ncreated, the Montana Department of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,”\nover the objection of the Montana Attorney General. That\nadministrative rule prohibited families from using scholarships at\nreligious schools. Mont. Admin. Rule §42.4.802(1)(a) (2015). It did\nso by changing the definition of “qualified education provider” to\nexclude any school “owned or controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, religious sect, or denomination.” Ibid. The\nDepartment explained that the Rule was needed to reconcile the\nscholarship program with the no-aid provision of the Montana\nConstitution. The Montana Attorney General disagreed. In a\nletter to the Department, he advised that the Montana Constitution\ndid not require excluding religious schools from the program, and\nif it did, it would “very likely” violate the United States\nConstitution by discriminating against the schools and their\nstudents. See Complaint in No. DV–15–1152A (Dist. Ct. Flathead\nCty.), Exh. 3, pp. 2, 5–6. The Attorney General is not representing\nthe Department in this case. B This suit was brought by three mothers whose\nchildren attend Stillwater Christian School in northwestern\nMontana. Stillwater is a private Christian school that meets the\nstatutory criteria for “qualified education providers.” It serves\nstudents in prekindergarten through 12th grade, and petitioners\nchose the school in large part because it “teaches the same\nChristian values that [they] teach at home.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n152; see id. , at 138, 167. The child of one petitioner has\nalready received scholarships from Big Sky, and the other\npetitioners’ children are eligible for scholarships and planned to\napply. While in effect, however, Rule 1 blocked petitioners from\nusing scholarship funds for tuition at Stillwater. To overcome that\nobstacle, petitioners sued the Department of Revenue in Montana\nstate court. Petitioners claimed that Rule 1 conflicted with the\nstatute that created the scholarship program and could not be\njustified on the ground that it was compelled by the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. Petitioners further alleged that\nthe Rule discriminated on the basis of their religious views and\nthe religious nature of the school they had chosen for their\nchildren. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, holding that it\nwas based on a mistake of law. The court explained that the Rule\nwas not required by the no-aid provision, because that provision\nprohibits only “appropriations” that aid religious schools, “not\ntax credits.” Id. , at 94. The injunctive relief freed Big Sky to award\nscholarships to students regardless of whether they attended a\nreligious or secular school. For the school year beginning in fall\n2017, Big Sky received 59 applications and ultimately awarded 44\nscholarships of $500 each. The next year, Big Sky received 90\napplications and awarded 54 scholarships of $500 each. Several\nfamilies, most with incomes of $30,000 or less, used the\nscholarships to send their children to Stillwater Christian. In December 2018, the Montana Supreme Court\nreversed the trial court. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603. The Court\nfirst addressed the scholarship program unmodified by Rule 1,\nholding that the program aided religious schools in violation of\nthe no-aid provision of the Montana Constitution. In the Court’s\nview, the no-aid provision “broadly and strictly prohibits aid to\nsectarian schools.” Id. , at 459, 435 P. 3d, at 609. The\nscholarship program provided such aid by using tax credits to\n“subsidize tuition payments” at private schools that are\n“religiously affiliated” or “controlled in whole or in part by\nchurches.” Id. , at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at 612–613. In\nthat way, the scholarship program flouted the State Constitution’s\n“guarantee to all Montanans that their government will not use\nstate funds to aid religious schools.” Id. , at 467, 435\nP. 3d, at 614. The Montana Supreme Court went on to hold that\nthe violation of the no-aid provision required invalidating the\nentire scholarship program. The Court explained that the program\nprovided “no mechanism” for preventing aid from flowing to\nreligious schools, and therefore the scholarship program could not\n“under any circumstance” be construed as consistent with the\nno-aid provision. Id. , at 466–468, 435 P. 3d, at\n613–614. As a result, the tax credit is no longer available to\nsupport scholarships at either religious or secular private\nschools. The Montana Supreme Court acknowledged that “an\noverly-broad” application of the no-aid provision “could implicate\nfree exercise concerns” and that “there may be a case” where\n“prohibiting the aid would violate the Free Exercise Clause.” Id. , at 468, 435 P. 3d, at 614. But, the Court\nconcluded, “this is not one of those cases.” Ibid. Finally, the Court agreed with petitioners that\nthe Department had exceeded its authority in promulgating\nRule 1. The Court explained that the statute creating the\nscholarship program had broadly defined qualifying schools to\ninclude all private schools, including religious ones, and the\nDepartment lacked authority to “transform” that definition with an\nadministrative rule. Id. , at 468–469, 435 P. 3d, at\n614–615. Several Justices wrote separately. All agreed\nthat Rule 1 was invalid, but they expressed differing views on\nwhether the scholarship program was consistent with the Montana and\nUnited States Constitutions. Justice Gustafson’s concurrence argued\nthat the program violated not only Montana’s no-aid provision but\nalso the Federal Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. Id. , at 475–479, 435 P. 3d, at 619–621. Justice\nSandefur echoed the majority’s conclusion that applying the no-aid\nprovision was consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, and he\ndismissed the “modern jurisprudence” of that Clause as\n“unnecessarily complicate[d]” due to “increasingly value-driven\nhairsplitting and overstretching.” Id. , at 482–484, 435\nP. 3d, at 623–624. Two Justices dissented. Justice Rice would have\nheld that the scholarship program was permissible under the no-aid\nprovision. He criticized the majority for invalidating the program\n“ sua sponte ,” contending that no party had challenged\nit under the State Constitution. Id. , at 495, 435\nP. 3d, at 631. Justice Baker also would have upheld the\nprogram. In her view, the no-aid provision did not bar the use of\nscholarships at religious schools, and free exercise concerns could\narise under the Federal Constitution if it did. Id. , at\n493–494, 435 P. 3d, at 630. We granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___\n(2019). II A The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment\nprovide that “Congress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof.” We have recognized a “ ‘play in the joints’ between what\nthe Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause\ncompels.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Locke v. Davey , 540\nU.S. 712 , 718 (2004)). Here, the parties do not dispute that\nthe scholarship program is permissible under the Establishment\nClause. Nor could they. We have repeatedly held that the\nEstablishment Clause is not offended when religious observers and\norganizations benefit from neutral government programs. See, e.g. , Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S.\n819 , 839 (1995). See also Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (noting the parties’ agreement\nthat the Establishment Clause was not violated by including\nchurches in a playground resurfacing program). Any Establishment\nClause objection to the scholarship program here is particularly\nunavailing because the government support makes its way to\nreligious schools only as a result of Montanans independently\nchoosing to spend their scholarships at such schools. See Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , 536 U.S.\n639 , 649–653 (2002). The Montana Supreme Court, however, held\nas a matter of state law that even such indirect government support\nqualified as “aid” prohibited under the Montana Constitution. The question for this Court is whether the Free\nExercise Clause precluded the Montana Supreme Court from applying\nMontana’s no-aid provision to bar religious schools from the\nscholarship program. For purposes of answering that question, we\naccept the Montana Supreme Court’s interpretation of state\nlaw—including its determination that the scholarship program\nprovided impermissible “aid” within the meaning of the Montana\nConstitution—and we assess whether excluding religious schools and\naffected families from that program was consistent with the Federal\nConstitution.[ 2 ] The Free Exercise Clause, which applies to the\nStates under the Fourteenth Amendment, “protects religious\nobservers against unequal treatment” and against “laws that impose\nspecial disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 9)\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310\nU.S. 296 , 303 (1940). Those “basic principle[s ]” have\nlong guided this Court. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 6–9). See, e.g. , Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U.S.\n1 , 16 (1947) (a State “cannot exclude individual Catholics,\nLutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers,\nPresbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of\ntheir faith, or lack of it , from receiving the benefits of\npublic welfare legislation”); Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , 449 (1988) (the Free Exercise Clause protects against laws\nthat “penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal\nshare of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other\ncitizens”). Most recently, Trinity Lutheran distilled\nthese and other decisions to the same effect into the\n“unremarkable” conclusion that disqualifying otherwise eligible\nrecipients from a public benefit “solely because of their religious\ncharacter” imposes “a penalty on the free exercise of religion that\ntriggers the most exacting scrutiny.” 582 U. S., at ___–___\n(slip op., at 9–10). In Trinity Lutheran , Missouri provided\ngrants to help nonprofit organizations pay for playground\nresurfacing, but a state policy disqualified any organization\n“owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 2). Because of that policy, an\notherwise eligible church-owned preschool was denied a grant to\nresurface its playground. Missouri’s policy discriminated against\nthe Church “simply because of what it is—a church,” and so the\npolicy was subject to the “strictest scrutiny,” which it failed. Id. , at ___–___ (slip op., at 11–15). We acknowledged that\nthe State had not “criminalized” the way in which the Church\nworshipped or “told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a\ncertain view of the Gospel.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 11).\nBut the State’s discriminatory policy was “odious to our\nConstitution all the same.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at\n15). Here too Montana’s no-aid provision bars\nreligious schools from public benefits solely because of the\nreligious character of the schools. The provision also bars parents\nwho wish to send their children to a religious school from those\nsame benefits, again solely because of the religious character of\nthe school. This is apparent from the plain text. The provision\nbars aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination.” Mont. Const., Art. X, §6(1).\nThe provision’s title—“Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools”—confirms that the provision singles out schools based on\ntheir religious character. Ibid. And the Montana Supreme\nCourt explained that the provision forbids aid to any school that\nis “sectarian,” “religiously affiliated,” or “controlled in whole\nor in part by churches.” 393 Mont., at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at\n612–613. The provision plainly excludes schools from government aid\nsolely because of religious status. See Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–10). The Department counters that Trinity\nLutheran does not govern here because the no-aid provision\napplies not because of the religious character of the recipients,\nbut because of how the funds would be used—for “religious\neducation.” Brief for Respondents 38. In Trinity Lutheran , a\nmajority of the Court concluded that the Missouri policy violated\nthe Free Exercise Clause because it discriminated on the basis of\nreligious status. A plurality declined to address discrimination\nwith respect to “religious uses of funding or other forms of\ndiscrimination.” 582 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 14, n.\n3). The plurality saw no need to consider such concerns because\nMissouri had expressly discriminated “based on religious identity,” ibid. , which was enough to invalidate the state policy\nwithout addressing how government funds were used. This case also turns expressly on religious\nstatus and not religious use. The Montana Supreme Court applied the\nno-aid provision solely by reference to religious status. The Court\nrepeatedly explained that the no-aid provision bars aid to “schools\ncontrolled in whole or in part by churches,” “sectarian schools,”\nand “religiously-affiliated schools.” 393 Mont., at 463–467, 435\nP. 3d, at 611–613. Applying this provision to the scholarship\nprogram, the Montana Supreme Court noted that most of the private\nschools that would benefit from the program were “religiously\naffiliated” and “controlled by churches,” and the Court ultimately\nconcluded that the scholarship program ran afoul of the Montana\nConstitution by aiding “schools controlled by churches.” Id. , at 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 613–614. The Montana\nConstitution discriminates based on religious status just like the\nMissouri policy in Trinity Lutheran , which excluded\norganizations “owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other\nreligious entity.” 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). The Department points to some language in the\ndecision below indicating that the no-aid provision has the goal or\neffect of ensuring that government aid does not end up being used\nfor “sectarian education” or “religious education.” 393 Mont., at\n460, 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 609, 613–614. The Department also\ncontrasts what it characterizes as the “completely non-religious”\nbenefit of playground resurfacing in Trinity Lutheran with\nthe unrestricted tuition aid at issue here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.\nGeneral school aid, the Department stresses, could be used for\nreligious ends by some recipients, particularly schools that\nbelieve faith should “ permeate [ ]” everything they do.\nBrief for Respondents 39 (quoting State ex rel. Chambers v. School Dist. No. 10 , 155 Mont. 422, 438, 472 P.2d 1013 , 1021 (1970)). See also post , at 8, 13\n(Breyer, J., dissenting). Regardless, those considerations were not the\nMontana Supreme Court’s basis for applying the no-aid provision to\nexclude religious schools; that hinged solely on religious status.\nStatus-based discrimination remains status based even if one of its\ngoals or effects is preventing religious organizations from putting\naid to religious uses. Undeterred by Trinity Lutheran , the\nMontana Supreme Court applied the no-aid provision to hold that\nreligious schools could not benefit from the scholarship program.\n393 Mont., at 464–468, 435 P. 3d, at 612–614. So applied, the\nprovision “impose[s] special disabilities on the basis of religious\nstatus” and “condition[s] the availability of benefits upon a\nrecipient’s willingness to surrender [its] religiously impelled\nstatus.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 9–10) (quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508\nU.S. 520 , 533 (1993), and McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U.S.\n618 , 626 (1978) (plurality opinion) (alterations omitted)). To\nbe eligible for government aid under the Montana Constitution, a\nschool must divorce itself from any religious control or\naffiliation. Placing such a condition on benefits or privileges\n“inevitably deters or discourages the exercise of First Amendment\nrights.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S.\n398 , 405 (1963) (alterations omitted)). The Free Exercise\nClause protects against even “indirect coercion,” and a State\n“punishe[s] the free exercise of religion” by disqualifying the\nreligious from government aid as Montana did here. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Such status-based\ndiscrimination is subject to “the strictest scrutiny.” Id. ,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). None of this is meant to suggest that we agree\nwith the Department, Brief for Respondents 36–40, that some lesser\ndegree of scrutiny applies to discrimination against religious uses\nof government aid. See Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546\n(striking down law designed to ban religious practice involving\nalleged animal cruelty, explaining that a law “target[ing]\nreligious conduct for distinctive treatment or advanc[ing]\nlegitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a\nreligious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare\ncases”). Some Members of the Court, moreover, have questioned\nwhether there is a meaningful distinction between discrimination\nbased on use or conduct and that based on status. See Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2)\n(Gorsuch, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in part) (citing, e.g. , Lukumi , 508 U.S.\n520 , and Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment\nSecurity Div. , 450 U.S.\n707 (1981)). We acknowledge the point but need not examine it\nhere. It is enough in this case to conclude that strict scrutiny\napplies under Trinity Lutheran because Montana’s no-aid\nprovision discriminates based on religious status. B Seeking to avoid Trinity Lutheran , the\nDepartment contends that this case is instead governed by Locke v. Davey , 540 U.S.\n712 (2004). See also post , at 5 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting); post , at 9 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Locke also involved a scholarship program. The State of\nWashington provided scholarships paid out of the State’s general\nfund to help students pursuing postsecondary education. The\nscholarships could be used at accredited religious and nonreligious\nschools alike, but Washington prohibited students from using the\nscholarships to pursue devotional theology degrees, which prepared\nstudents for a calling as clergy. This prohibition prevented Davey\nfrom using his scholarship to obtain a degree that would have\nenabled him to become a pastor. We held that Washington had not\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. Locke differs from this case in two\ncritical ways. First, Locke explained that Washington had\n“merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction”: the\n“essentially religious endeavor” of training a minister “to lead a\ncongregation.” Id. , at 721. Thus, Davey “was denied a\nscholarship because of what he proposed to do —use the funds\nto prepare for the ministry.” Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Apart from that narrow\nrestriction, Washington’s program allowed scholarships to be used\nat “pervasively religious schools” that incorporated religious\ninstruction throughout their classes. Locke , 540 U. S.,\nat 724–725. By contrast, Montana’s Constitution does not zero in on\nany particular “essentially religious” course of instruction at a\nreligious school. Rather, as we have explained, the no-aid\nprovision bars all aid to a religious school “simply because of\nwhat it is,” putting the school to a choice between being religious\nor receiving government benefits. Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). At the same time, the\nprovision puts families to a choice between sending their children\nto a religious school or receiving such benefits. Second, Locke invoked a “historic and\nsubstantial” state interest in not funding the training of clergy,\n540 U. S., at 725, explaining that “opposition to\n. . . funding ‘to support church leaders’ lay at the\nhistoric core of the Religion Clauses,” Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting Locke , 540\nU. S., at 722). As evidence of that tradition, the Court in Locke emphasized that the propriety of state-supported\nclergy was a central subject of founding-era debates, and that most\nstate constitutions from that era prohibited the expenditure of tax\ndollars to support the clergy. See id. , at 722–723. But no comparable “historic and substantial”\ntradition supports Montana’s decision to disqualify religious\nschools from government aid. In the founding era and the early 19th\ncentury, governments provided financial support to private schools,\nincluding denominational ones. “Far from prohibiting such support,\nthe early state constitutions and statutes actively encouraged this\npolicy.” L. Jorgenson, The State and the Non-Public School,\n1825–1925, p. 4 (1987); e.g., R. Gabel, Public Funds for\nChurch and Private Schools 210, 217–218, 221, 241–243 (1937); C.\nKaestle, Pillars of the Republic: Common Schools and American\nSociety, 1760–1860, pp. 166–167 (1983). Local governments provided\ngrants to private schools, including religious ones, for the\neducation of the poor. M. McConnell, et al., Religion and the\nConstitution 318–319 (4th ed. 2016). Even States with bans on\ngovernment-supported clergy, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\nGeorgia, provided various forms of aid to religious schools.\n See Kaestle, supra , at 166–167; Gabel, supra ,\nat 215–218, 241–245, 372–374; cf. Locke , 540 U. S., at\n723. Early federal aid (often land grants) went to religious\nschools. McConnell, supra , at 319. Congress provided support\nto denominational schools in the District of Columbia until 1848, ibid. , and Congress paid churches to run schools for\nAmerican Indians through the end of the 19th century, see Quick\nBear v. Leupp , 210 U.S.\n50 , 78 (1908); Gabel, supra , at 521–523. After the Civil\nWar, Congress spent large sums on education for emancipated\nfreedmen, often by supporting denominational schools in the South\nthrough the Freedmen’s Bureau. McConnell, supra , at\n323.[ 3 ] The Department argues that a tradition against state support for religious schools arose in the\nsecond half of the 19th century, as more than 30 States—including\nMontana—adopted no-aid provisions. See Brief for Respondents 40–42\nand App. D. Such a development, of course, cannot by itself\nestablish an early American tradition. Justice Sotomayor questions\nour reliance on aid provided during the same era by the Freedmen’s\nBureau, post , at 10 (dissenting opinion), but we see no\ninconsistency in recognizing that such evidence may reinforce an\nearly practice but cannot create one. In addition, many of the\nno-aid provisions belong to a more checkered tradition shared with\nthe Blaine Amendment of the 1870s. That proposal—which Congress\nnearly passed—would have added to the Federal Constitution a\nprovision similar to the state no-aid provisions, prohibiting\n",

MONTANA\nDEPARTMENT OF REVENUE et al. certiorari to the supreme court of montana No. 18–1195. Argued January 22, 2020—Decided\nJune 30, 2020 The Montana Legislature established a program\nthat grants tax credits to those who donate to organizations that\naward scholarships for private school tuition. To reconcile the\nprogram with a provision of the Montana Constitution that bars\ngovernment aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination,” Art. X, §6(1), the Montana\nDepartment of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,” which prohibited\nfamilies from using the scholarships at religious schools. Three\nmothers who were blocked by Rule 1 from using scholarship funds for\ntheir children’s tuition at Stillwater Christian School sued the\nDepartment in state court, alleging that the Rule discriminated on\nthe basis of their religious views and the religious nature of the\nschool they had chosen. The trial court enjoined Rule 1. Reversing,\nthe Montana Supreme Court held that the program, unmodified by Rule\n1, aided religious schools in violation of the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. The Court further held that the\nviolation required invalidating the entire program. Held : The application of the\nno-aid provision discriminated against religious schools and the\nfamilies whose children attend or hope to attend them in violation\nof the Free Exercise Clause of the Federal Constitution.\nPp. 6–22. (a) The Free Exercise Clause “protects\nreligious observers against unequal treatment” and against “laws\nthat impose special disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer ,\n582 U. S. ___, ___. In Trinity Lutheran , this Court\nheld that disqualifying otherwise eligible recipients from a public\nbenefit “solely because of their religious character” imposes “a\npenalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most\nexacting scrutiny.” Id. , at ___. Here, the application of\nMontana’s no-aid provision excludes religious schools from public\nbenefits solely because of religious status. As a result, strict\nscrutiny applies. Pp. 6–12. (b) Contrary to the Department’s\ncontention, this case is not governed by Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S.\n712 . The plaintiff in Locke was denied a scholarship\n“because of what he proposed to do —use the funds to prepare\nfor the ministry,” an essentially religious endeavor. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. By contrast, Montana’s no-aid\nprovision does not zero in on any essentially religious course of\ninstruction but rather bars aid to a religious school “simply\nbecause of what it is”—a religious school. Id. , at ___. Locke also invoked a “historic and substantial” state\ninterest in not funding the training of clergy, 540 U. S., at\n725, but no comparable tradition supports Montana’s decision to\ndisqualify religious schools from government aid.\nPp. 12–16. (c) The proposed alternative approach\ninvolving a flexible case-by-case analysis is inconsistent with Trinity Lutheran . The protections of the Free Exercise\nClause do not depend on a varying case-by-case analysis regarding\nwhether discrimination against religious adherents would serve\nill-defined interests. Pp. 16–18. (d) To satisfy strict scrutiny, government\naction “must advance ‘interests of the highest order’ and must be\nnarrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.” Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546. Montana’s interest in creating greater separation of\nchurch and State than the Federal Constitution requires “cannot\nqualify as compelling” in the face of the infringement of free\nexercise here. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. The\nDepartment’s argument that the no-aid provision actually promotes\nreligious freedom is unavailing because an infringement of First\nAmendment rights cannot be justified by a State’s alternative view\nthat the infringement advances religious liberty. The Department’s\nargument is especially unconvincing because the infringement here\nbroadly burdens not only religious schools but also the families\nwhose children attend them. The Department suggests that the no-aid\nprovision safeguards public education by ensuring that government\nsupport is not diverted to private schools, but that interest does\nnot justify a no-aid provision that requires only religious private\nschools to bear its weight. Pp. 18–20. (e) Because the Free Exercise Clause\nbarred the application of the no-aid provision here, the Montana\nSupreme Court had no authority to invalidate the program on the\nbasis of that provision. The Department argues that the\ninvalidation of the entire program prevented a free exercise\nviolation, but the Department overlooks the Montana Supreme Court’s\nthreshold error of federal law. Had the Montana Supreme Court\nrecognized that the application of the no-aid provision was barred\nby the Free Exercise Clause, the Court would have had no basis for\ninvalidating the program. The Court was obligated to disregard the\nno-aid provision and decide this case consistent with the Federal\nConstitution. Pp. 20–22. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603, reversed and\nremanded. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, in which Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ.,\njoined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Gorsuch,\nJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 18–1195 _________________ KENDRA ESPINOZA, et al., PETITIONERS v. MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, et al. on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmontana [June 30, 2020] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. The Montana Legislature established a program to\nprovide tuition assistance to parents who send their children to\nprivate schools. The program grants a tax credit to anyone who\ndonates to certain organizations that in turn award scholarships to\nselected students attending such schools. When petitioners sought\nto use the scholarships at a religious school, the Montana Supreme\nCourt struck down the program. The Court relied on the “no-aid”\nprovision of the State Constitution, which prohibits any aid to a\nschool controlled by a “church, sect, or denomination.” The\nquestion presented is whether the Free Exercise Clause of the\nUnited States Constitution barred that application of the no-aid\nprovision. I A In 2015, the Montana Legislature sought “to\nprovide parental and student choice in education” by enacting a\nscholarship program for students attending private schools. 2015\nMont. Laws p. 2168, §7. The program grants a tax credit of up to\n$150 to any taxpayer who donates to a participating “student\nscholarship organization.” Mont. Code Ann. §§15–30–3103(1),\n–3111(1) (2019). The scholarship organizations then use the\ndonations to award scholarships to children for tuition at a\nprivate school. §§15–30–3102(7)(a), –3103(1)(c).[ 1 ] So far only one scholarship organization, Big\nSky Scholarships, has participated in the program. Big Sky focuses\non providing scholarships to families who face financial hardship\nor have children with disabilities. Scholarship organizations like\nBig Sky must, among other requirements, maintain an application\nprocess for awarding the scholarships; use at least 90% of all\ndonations on scholarship awards; and comply with state reporting\nand monitoring requirements. §§15–30–3103(1), –3105(1),\n–3113(1). A family whose child is awarded a scholarship\nunder the program may use it at any “qualified education\nprovider”—that is, any private school that meets certain\naccreditation, testing, and safety requirements. See\n§15–30–3102(7). Virtually every private school in Montana\nqualifies. Upon receiving a scholarship, the family designates its\nschool of choice, and the scholarship organization sends the\nscholarship funds directly to the school. §15–30–3104(1). Neither\nthe scholarship organization nor its donors can restrict awards to\nparticular types of schools. See §§15–30–3103(1)(b), –3111(1). The Montana Legislature allotted $3 million\nannually to fund the tax credits, beginning in 2016.\n§15–30–3111(5)(a). If the annual allotment is exhausted, it\nincreases by 10% the following year. Ibid. The program is\nslated to expire in 2023. 2015 Mont. Laws p. 2186, §33. The Montana Legislature also directed that the\nprogram be administered in accordance with Article X, section 6, of\nthe Montana Constitution, which contains a “no-aid” provision\nbarring government aid to sectarian schools. See Mont. Code Ann.\n§15–30–3101. In full, that provision states: “ Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools . . . . The legislature, counties, cities, towns,\nschool districts, and public corporations shall not make any direct\nor indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or\nmonies, or any grant of lands or other property for any sectarian\npurpose or to aid any church, school, academy, seminary, college,\nuniversity, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled\nin whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.” Mont.\nConst., Art. X, §6(1). Shortly after the scholarship program was\ncreated, the Montana Department of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,”\nover the objection of the Montana Attorney General. That\nadministrative rule prohibited families from using scholarships at\nreligious schools. Mont. Admin. Rule §42.4.802(1)(a) (2015). It did\nso by changing the definition of “qualified education provider” to\nexclude any school “owned or controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, religious sect, or denomination.” Ibid. The\nDepartment explained that the Rule was needed to reconcile the\nscholarship program with the no-aid provision of the Montana\nConstitution. The Montana Attorney General disagreed. In a\nletter to the Department, he advised that the Montana Constitution\ndid not require excluding religious schools from the program, and\nif it did, it would “very likely” violate the United States\nConstitution by discriminating against the schools and their\nstudents. See Complaint in No. DV–15–1152A (Dist. Ct. Flathead\nCty.), Exh. 3, pp. 2, 5–6. The Attorney General is not representing\nthe Department in this case. B This suit was brought by three mothers whose\nchildren attend Stillwater Christian School in northwestern\nMontana. Stillwater is a private Christian school that meets the\nstatutory criteria for “qualified education providers.” It serves\nstudents in prekindergarten through 12th grade, and petitioners\nchose the school in large part because it “teaches the same\nChristian values that [they] teach at home.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n152; see id. , at 138, 167. The child of one petitioner has\nalready received scholarships from Big Sky, and the other\npetitioners’ children are eligible for scholarships and planned to\napply. While in effect, however, Rule 1 blocked petitioners from\nusing scholarship funds for tuition at Stillwater. To overcome that\nobstacle, petitioners sued the Department of Revenue in Montana\nstate court. Petitioners claimed that Rule 1 conflicted with the\nstatute that created the scholarship program and could not be\njustified on the ground that it was compelled by the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. Petitioners further alleged that\nthe Rule discriminated on the basis of their religious views and\nthe religious nature of the school they had chosen for their\nchildren. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, holding that it\nwas based on a mistake of law. The court explained that the Rule\nwas not required by the no-aid provision, because that provision\nprohibits only “appropriations” that aid religious schools, “not\ntax credits.” Id. , at 94. The injunctive relief freed Big Sky to award\nscholarships to students regardless of whether they attended a\nreligious or secular school. For the school year beginning in fall\n2017, Big Sky received 59 applications and ultimately awarded 44\nscholarships of $500 each. The next year, Big Sky received 90\napplications and awarded 54 scholarships of $500 each. Several\nfamilies, most with incomes of $30,000 or less, used the\nscholarships to send their children to Stillwater Christian. In December 2018, the Montana Supreme Court\nreversed the trial court. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603. The Court\nfirst addressed the scholarship program unmodified by Rule 1,\nholding that the program aided religious schools in violation of\nthe no-aid provision of the Montana Constitution. In the Court’s\nview, the no-aid provision “broadly and strictly prohibits aid to\nsectarian schools.” Id. , at 459, 435 P. 3d, at 609. The\nscholarship program provided such aid by using tax credits to\n“subsidize tuition payments” at private schools that are\n“religiously affiliated” or “controlled in whole or in part by\nchurches.” Id. , at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at 612–613. In\nthat way, the scholarship program flouted the State Constitution’s\n“guarantee to all Montanans that their government will not use\nstate funds to aid religious schools.” Id. , at 467, 435\nP. 3d, at 614. The Montana Supreme Court went on to hold that\nthe violation of the no-aid provision required invalidating the\nentire scholarship program. The Court explained that the program\nprovided “no mechanism” for preventing aid from flowing to\nreligious schools, and therefore the scholarship program could not\n“under any circumstance” be construed as consistent with the\nno-aid provision. Id. , at 466–468, 435 P. 3d, at\n613–614. As a result, the tax credit is no longer available to\nsupport scholarships at either religious or secular private\nschools. The Montana Supreme Court acknowledged that “an\noverly-broad” application of the no-aid provision “could implicate\nfree exercise concerns” and that “there may be a case” where\n“prohibiting the aid would violate the Free Exercise Clause.” Id. , at 468, 435 P. 3d, at 614. But, the Court\nconcluded, “this is not one of those cases.” Ibid. Finally, the Court agreed with petitioners that\nthe Department had exceeded its authority in promulgating\nRule 1. The Court explained that the statute creating the\nscholarship program had broadly defined qualifying schools to\ninclude all private schools, including religious ones, and the\nDepartment lacked authority to “transform” that definition with an\nadministrative rule. Id. , at 468–469, 435 P. 3d, at\n614–615. Several Justices wrote separately. All agreed\nthat Rule 1 was invalid, but they expressed differing views on\nwhether the scholarship program was consistent with the Montana and\nUnited States Constitutions. Justice Gustafson’s concurrence argued\nthat the program violated not only Montana’s no-aid provision but\nalso the Federal Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. Id. , at 475–479, 435 P. 3d, at 619–621. Justice\nSandefur echoed the majority’s conclusion that applying the no-aid\nprovision was consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, and he\ndismissed the “modern jurisprudence” of that Clause as\n“unnecessarily complicate[d]” due to “increasingly value-driven\nhairsplitting and overstretching.” Id. , at 482–484, 435\nP. 3d, at 623–624. Two Justices dissented. Justice Rice would have\nheld that the scholarship program was permissible under the no-aid\nprovision. He criticized the majority for invalidating the program\n“ sua sponte ,” contending that no party had challenged\nit under the State Constitution. Id. , at 495, 435\nP. 3d, at 631. Justice Baker also would have upheld the\nprogram. In her view, the no-aid provision did not bar the use of\nscholarships at religious schools, and free exercise concerns could\narise under the Federal Constitution if it did. Id. , at\n493–494, 435 P. 3d, at 630. We granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___\n(2019). II A The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment\nprovide that “Congress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof.” We have recognized a “ ‘play in the joints’ between what\nthe Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause\ncompels.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Locke v. Davey , 540\nU.S. 712 , 718 (2004)). Here, the parties do not dispute that\nthe scholarship program is permissible under the Establishment\nClause. Nor could they. We have repeatedly held that the\nEstablishment Clause is not offended when religious observers and\norganizations benefit from neutral government programs. See, e.g. , Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S.\n819 , 839 (1995). See also Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (noting the parties’ agreement\nthat the Establishment Clause was not violated by including\nchurches in a playground resurfacing program). Any Establishment\nClause objection to the scholarship program here is particularly\nunavailing because the government support makes its way to\nreligious schools only as a result of Montanans independently\nchoosing to spend their scholarships at such schools. See Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , 536 U.S.\n639 , 649–653 (2002). The Montana Supreme Court, however, held\nas a matter of state law that even such indirect government support\nqualified as “aid” prohibited under the Montana Constitution. The question for this Court is whether the Free\nExercise Clause precluded the Montana Supreme Court from applying\nMontana’s no-aid provision to bar religious schools from the\nscholarship program. For purposes of answering that question, we\naccept the Montana Supreme Court’s interpretation of state\nlaw—including its determination that the scholarship program\nprovided impermissible “aid” within the meaning of the Montana\nConstitution—and we assess whether excluding religious schools and\naffected families from that program was consistent with the Federal\nConstitution.[ 2 ] The Free Exercise Clause, which applies to the\nStates under the Fourteenth Amendment, “protects religious\nobservers against unequal treatment” and against “laws that impose\nspecial disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 9)\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310\nU.S. 296 , 303 (1940). Those “basic principle[s ]” have\nlong guided this Court. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 6–9). See, e.g. , Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U.S.\n1 , 16 (1947) (a State “cannot exclude individual Catholics,\nLutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers,\nPresbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of\ntheir faith, or lack of it , from receiving the benefits of\npublic welfare legislation”); Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , 449 (1988) (the Free Exercise Clause protects against laws\nthat “penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal\nshare of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other\ncitizens”). Most recently, Trinity Lutheran distilled\nthese and other decisions to the same effect into the\n“unremarkable” conclusion that disqualifying otherwise eligible\nrecipients from a public benefit “solely because of their religious\ncharacter” imposes “a penalty on the free exercise of religion that\ntriggers the most exacting scrutiny.” 582 U. S., at ___–___\n(slip op., at 9–10). In Trinity Lutheran , Missouri provided\ngrants to help nonprofit organizations pay for playground\nresurfacing, but a state policy disqualified any organization\n“owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 2). Because of that policy, an\notherwise eligible church-owned preschool was denied a grant to\nresurface its playground. Missouri’s policy discriminated against\nthe Church “simply because of what it is—a church,” and so the\npolicy was subject to the “strictest scrutiny,” which it failed. Id. , at ___–___ (slip op., at 11–15). We acknowledged that\nthe State had not “criminalized” the way in which the Church\nworshipped or “told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a\ncertain view of the Gospel.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 11).\nBut the State’s discriminatory policy was “odious to our\nConstitution all the same.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at\n15). Here too Montana’s no-aid provision bars\nreligious schools from public benefits solely because of the\nreligious character of the schools. The provision also bars parents\nwho wish to send their children to a religious school from those\nsame benefits, again solely because of the religious character of\nthe school. This is apparent from the plain text. The provision\nbars aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination.” Mont. Const., Art. X, §6(1).\nThe provision’s title—“Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools”—confirms that the provision singles out schools based on\ntheir religious character. Ibid. And the Montana Supreme\nCourt explained that the provision forbids aid to any school that\nis “sectarian,” “religiously affiliated,” or “controlled in whole\nor in part by churches.” 393 Mont., at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at\n612–613. The provision plainly excludes schools from government aid\nsolely because of religious status. See Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–10). The Department counters that Trinity\nLutheran does not govern here because the no-aid provision\napplies not because of the religious character of the recipients,\nbut because of how the funds would be used—for “religious\neducation.” Brief for Respondents 38. In Trinity Lutheran , a\nmajority of the Court concluded that the Missouri policy violated\nthe Free Exercise Clause because it discriminated on the basis of\nreligious status. A plurality declined to address discrimination\nwith respect to “religious uses of funding or other forms of\ndiscrimination.” 582 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 14, n.\n3). The plurality saw no need to consider such concerns because\nMissouri had expressly discriminated “based on religious identity,” ibid. , which was enough to invalidate the state policy\nwithout addressing how government funds were used. This case also turns expressly on religious\nstatus and not religious use. The Montana Supreme Court applied the\nno-aid provision solely by reference to religious status. The Court\nrepeatedly explained that the no-aid provision bars aid to “schools\ncontrolled in whole or in part by churches,” “sectarian schools,”\nand “religiously-affiliated schools.” 393 Mont., at 463–467, 435\nP. 3d, at 611–613. Applying this provision to the scholarship\nprogram, the Montana Supreme Court noted that most of the private\nschools that would benefit from the program were “religiously\naffiliated” and “controlled by churches,” and the Court ultimately\nconcluded that the scholarship program ran afoul of the Montana\nConstitution by aiding “schools controlled by churches.” Id. , at 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 613–614. The Montana\nConstitution discriminates based on religious status just like the\nMissouri policy in Trinity Lutheran , which excluded\norganizations “owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other\nreligious entity.” 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). The Department points to some language in the\ndecision below indicating that the no-aid provision has the goal or\neffect of ensuring that government aid does not end up being used\nfor “sectarian education” or “religious education.” 393 Mont., at\n460, 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 609, 613–614. The Department also\ncontrasts what it characterizes as the “completely non-religious”\nbenefit of playground resurfacing in Trinity Lutheran with\nthe unrestricted tuition aid at issue here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.\nGeneral school aid, the Department stresses, could be used for\nreligious ends by some recipients, particularly schools that\nbelieve faith should “ permeate [ ]” everything they do.\nBrief for Respondents 39 (quoting State ex rel. Chambers v. School Dist. No. 10 , 155 Mont. 422, 438, 472 P.2d 1013 , 1021 (1970)). See also post , at 8, 13\n(Breyer, J., dissenting). Regardless, those considerations were not the\nMontana Supreme Court’s basis for applying the no-aid provision to\nexclude religious schools; that hinged solely on religious status.\nStatus-based discrimination remains status based even if one of its\ngoals or effects is preventing religious organizations from putting\naid to religious uses. Undeterred by Trinity Lutheran , the\nMontana Supreme Court applied the no-aid provision to hold that\nreligious schools could not benefit from the scholarship program.\n393 Mont., at 464–468, 435 P. 3d, at 612–614. So applied, the\nprovision “impose[s] special disabilities on the basis of religious\nstatus” and “condition[s] the availability of benefits upon a\nrecipient’s willingness to surrender [its] religiously impelled\nstatus.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 9–10) (quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508\nU.S. 520 , 533 (1993), and McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U.S.\n618 , 626 (1978) (plurality opinion) (alterations omitted)). To\nbe eligible for government aid under the Montana Constitution, a\nschool must divorce itself from any religious control or\naffiliation. Placing such a condition on benefits or privileges\n“inevitably deters or discourages the exercise of First Amendment\nrights.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S.\n398 , 405 (1963) (alterations omitted)). The Free Exercise\nClause protects against even “indirect coercion,” and a State\n“punishe[s] the free exercise of religion” by disqualifying the\nreligious from government aid as Montana did here. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Such status-based\ndiscrimination is subject to “the strictest scrutiny.” Id. ,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). None of this is meant to suggest that we agree\nwith the Department, Brief for Respondents 36–40, that some lesser\ndegree of scrutiny applies to discrimination against religious uses\nof government aid. See Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546\n(striking down law designed to ban religious practice involving\nalleged animal cruelty, explaining that a law “target[ing]\nreligious conduct for distinctive treatment or advanc[ing]\nlegitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a\nreligious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare\ncases”). Some Members of the Court, moreover, have questioned\nwhether there is a meaningful distinction between discrimination\nbased on use or conduct and that based on status. See Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2)\n(Gorsuch, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in part) (citing, e.g. , Lukumi , 508 U.S.\n520 , and Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment\nSecurity Div. , 450 U.S.\n707 (1981)). We acknowledge the point but need not examine it\nhere. It is enough in this case to conclude that strict scrutiny\napplies under Trinity Lutheran because Montana’s no-aid\nprovision discriminates based on religious status. B Seeking to avoid Trinity Lutheran , the\nDepartment contends that this case is instead governed by Locke v. Davey , 540 U.S.\n712 (2004). See also post , at 5 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting); post , at 9 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Locke also involved a scholarship program. The State of\nWashington provided scholarships paid out of the State’s general\nfund to help students pursuing postsecondary education. The\nscholarships could be used at accredited religious and nonreligious\nschools alike, but Washington prohibited students from using the\nscholarships to pursue devotional theology degrees, which prepared\nstudents for a calling as clergy. This prohibition prevented Davey\nfrom using his scholarship to obtain a degree that would have\nenabled him to become a pastor. We held that Washington had not\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. Locke differs from this case in two\ncritical ways. First, Locke explained that Washington had\n“merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction”: the\n“essentially religious endeavor” of training a minister “to lead a\ncongregation.” Id. , at 721. Thus, Davey “was denied a\nscholarship because of what he proposed to do —use the funds\nto prepare for the ministry.” Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Apart from that narrow\nrestriction, Washington’s program allowed scholarships to be used\nat “pervasively religious schools” that incorporated religious\ninstruction throughout their classes. Locke , 540 U. S.,\nat 724–725. By contrast, Montana’s Constitution does not zero in on\nany particular “essentially religious” course of instruction at a\nreligious school. Rather, as we have explained, the no-aid\nprovision bars all aid to a religious school “simply because of\nwhat it is,” putting the school to a choice between being religious\nor receiving government benefits. Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). At the same time, the\nprovision puts families to a choice between sending their children\nto a religious school or receiving such benefits. Second, Locke invoked a “historic and\nsubstantial” state interest in not funding the training of clergy,\n540 U. S., at 725, explaining that “opposition to\n. . . funding ‘to support church leaders’ lay at the\nhistoric core of the Religion Clauses,” Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting Locke , 540\nU. S., at 722). As evidence of that tradition, the Court in Locke emphasized that the propriety of state-supported\nclergy was a central subject of founding-era debates, and that most\nstate constitutions from that era prohibited the expenditure of tax\ndollars to support the clergy. See id. , at 722–723. But no comparable “historic and substantial”\ntradition supports Montana’s decision to disqualify religious\nschools from government aid. In the founding era and the early 19th\ncentury, governments provided financial support to private schools,\nincluding denominational ones. “Far from prohibiting such support,\nthe early state constitutions and statutes actively encouraged this\npolicy.” L. Jorgenson, The State and the Non-Public School,\n1825–1925, p. 4 (1987); e.g., R. Gabel, Public Funds for\nChurch and Private Schools 210, 217–218, 221, 241–243 (1937); C.\nKaestle, Pillars of the Republic: Common Schools and American\nSociety, 1760–1860, pp. 166–167 (1983). Local governments provided\ngrants to private schools, including religious ones, for the\neducation of the poor. M. McConnell, et al., Religion and the\nConstitution 318–319 (4th ed. 2016). Even States with bans on\ngovernment-supported clergy, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\nGeorgia, provided various forms of aid to religious schools.\n See Kaestle, supra , at 166–167; Gabel, supra ,\nat 215–218, 241–245, 372–374; cf. Locke , 540 U. S., at\n723. Early federal aid (often land grants) went to religious\nschools. McConnell, supra , at 319. Congress provided support\nto denominational schools in the District of Columbia until 1848, ibid. , and Congress paid churches to run schools for\nAmerican Indians through the end of the 19th century, see Quick\nBear v. Leupp , 210 U.S.\n50 , 78 (1908); Gabel, supra , at 521–523. After the Civil\nWar, Congress spent large sums on education for emancipated\nfreedmen, often by supporting denominational schools in the South\nthrough the Freedmen’s Bureau. McConnell, supra , at\n323.[ 3 ] The Department argues that a tradition against state support for religious schools arose in the\nsecond half of the 19th century, as more than 30 States—including\nMontana—adopted no-aid provisions. See Brief for Respondents 40–42\nand App. D. Such a development, of course, cannot by itself\nestablish an early American tradition. Justice Sotomayor questions\nour reliance on aid provided during the same era by the Freedmen’s\nBureau, post , at 10 (dissenting opinion), but we see no\ninconsistency in recognizing that such evidence may reinforce an\nearly practice but cannot create one. In addition, many of the\nno-aid provisions belong to a more checkered tradition shared with\nthe Blaine Amendment of the 1870s. That proposal—which Congress\nnearly passed—would have added to the Federal Constitution a\nprovision similar to the state no-aid provisions, prohibiting\n",

MONTANA\nDEPARTMENT OF REVENUE et al. certiorari to the supreme court of montana No. 18–1195. Argued January 22, 2020—Decided\nJune 30, 2020 The Montana Legislature established a program\nthat grants tax credits to those who donate to organizations that\naward scholarships for private school tuition. To reconcile the\nprogram with a provision of the Montana Constitution that bars\ngovernment aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination,” Art. X, §6(1), the Montana\nDepartment of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,” which prohibited\nfamilies from using the scholarships at religious schools. Three\nmothers who were blocked by Rule 1 from using scholarship funds for\ntheir children’s tuition at Stillwater Christian School sued the\nDepartment in state court, alleging that the Rule discriminated on\nthe basis of their religious views and the religious nature of the\nschool they had chosen. The trial court enjoined Rule 1. Reversing,\nthe Montana Supreme Court held that the program, unmodified by Rule\n1, aided religious schools in violation of the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. The Court further held that the\nviolation required invalidating the entire program. Held : The application of the\nno-aid provision discriminated against religious schools and the\nfamilies whose children attend or hope to attend them in violation\nof the Free Exercise Clause of the Federal Constitution.\nPp. 6–22. (a) The Free Exercise Clause “protects\nreligious observers against unequal treatment” and against “laws\nthat impose special disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer ,\n582 U. S. ___, ___. In Trinity Lutheran , this Court\nheld that disqualifying otherwise eligible recipients from a public\nbenefit “solely because of their religious character” imposes “a\npenalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most\nexacting scrutiny.” Id. , at ___. Here, the application of\nMontana’s no-aid provision excludes religious schools from public\nbenefits solely because of religious status. As a result, strict\nscrutiny applies. Pp. 6–12. (b) Contrary to the Department’s\ncontention, this case is not governed by Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S.\n712 . The plaintiff in Locke was denied a scholarship\n“because of what he proposed to do —use the funds to prepare\nfor the ministry,” an essentially religious endeavor. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. By contrast, Montana’s no-aid\nprovision does not zero in on any essentially religious course of\ninstruction but rather bars aid to a religious school “simply\nbecause of what it is”—a religious school. Id. , at ___. Locke also invoked a “historic and substantial” state\ninterest in not funding the training of clergy, 540 U. S., at\n725, but no comparable tradition supports Montana’s decision to\ndisqualify religious schools from government aid.\nPp. 12–16. (c) The proposed alternative approach\ninvolving a flexible case-by-case analysis is inconsistent with Trinity Lutheran . The protections of the Free Exercise\nClause do not depend on a varying case-by-case analysis regarding\nwhether discrimination against religious adherents would serve\nill-defined interests. Pp. 16–18. (d) To satisfy strict scrutiny, government\naction “must advance ‘interests of the highest order’ and must be\nnarrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.” Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546. Montana’s interest in creating greater separation of\nchurch and State than the Federal Constitution requires “cannot\nqualify as compelling” in the face of the infringement of free\nexercise here. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. The\nDepartment’s argument that the no-aid provision actually promotes\nreligious freedom is unavailing because an infringement of First\nAmendment rights cannot be justified by a State’s alternative view\nthat the infringement advances religious liberty. The Department’s\nargument is especially unconvincing because the infringement here\nbroadly burdens not only religious schools but also the families\nwhose children attend them. The Department suggests that the no-aid\nprovision safeguards public education by ensuring that government\nsupport is not diverted to private schools, but that interest does\nnot justify a no-aid provision that requires only religious private\nschools to bear its weight. Pp. 18–20. (e) Because the Free Exercise Clause\nbarred the application of the no-aid provision here, the Montana\nSupreme Court had no authority to invalidate the program on the\nbasis of that provision. The Department argues that the\ninvalidation of the entire program prevented a free exercise\nviolation, but the Department overlooks the Montana Supreme Court’s\nthreshold error of federal law. Had the Montana Supreme Court\nrecognized that the application of the no-aid provision was barred\nby the Free Exercise Clause, the Court would have had no basis for\ninvalidating the program. The Court was obligated to disregard the\nno-aid provision and decide this case consistent with the Federal\nConstitution. Pp. 20–22. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603, reversed and\nremanded. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, in which Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ.,\njoined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Gorsuch,\nJ., joined. Alito, J., and Gorsuch, J., filed concurring opinions.\nGinsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Kagan, J.,\njoined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 18–1195 _________________ KENDRA ESPINOZA, et al., PETITIONERS v. MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, et al. on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmontana [June 30, 2020] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. The Montana Legislature established a program to\nprovide tuition assistance to parents who send their children to\nprivate schools. The program grants a tax credit to anyone who\ndonates to certain organizations that in turn award scholarships to\nselected students attending such schools. When petitioners sought\nto use the scholarships at a religious school, the Montana Supreme\nCourt struck down the program. The Court relied on the “no-aid”\nprovision of the State Constitution, which prohibits any aid to a\nschool controlled by a “church, sect, or denomination.” The\nquestion presented is whether the Free Exercise Clause of the\nUnited States Constitution barred that application of the no-aid\nprovision. I A In 2015, the Montana Legislature sought “to\nprovide parental and student choice in education” by enacting a\nscholarship program for students attending private schools. 2015\nMont. Laws p. 2168, §7. The program grants a tax credit of up to\n$150 to any taxpayer who donates to a participating “student\nscholarship organization.” Mont. Code Ann. §§15–30–3103(1),\n–3111(1) (2019). The scholarship organizations then use the\ndonations to award scholarships to children for tuition at a\nprivate school. §§15–30–3102(7)(a), –3103(1)(c).[ 1 ] So far only one scholarship organization, Big\nSky Scholarships, has participated in the program. Big Sky focuses\non providing scholarships to families who face financial hardship\nor have children with disabilities. Scholarship organizations like\nBig Sky must, among other requirements, maintain an application\nprocess for awarding the scholarships; use at least 90% of all\ndonations on scholarship awards; and comply with state reporting\nand monitoring requirements. §§15–30–3103(1), –3105(1),\n–3113(1). A family whose child is awarded a scholarship\nunder the program may use it at any “qualified education\nprovider”—that is, any private school that meets certain\naccreditation, testing, and safety requirements. See\n§15–30–3102(7). Virtually every private school in Montana\nqualifies. Upon receiving a scholarship, the family designates its\nschool of choice, and the scholarship organization sends the\nscholarship funds directly to the school. §15–30–3104(1). Neither\nthe scholarship organization nor its donors can restrict awards to\nparticular types of schools. See §§15–30–3103(1)(b), –3111(1). The Montana Legislature allotted $3 million\nannually to fund the tax credits, beginning in 2016.\n§15–30–3111(5)(a). If the annual allotment is exhausted, it\nincreases by 10% the following year. Ibid. The program is\nslated to expire in 2023. 2015 Mont. Laws p. 2186, §33. The Montana Legislature also directed that the\nprogram be administered in accordance with Article X, section 6, of\nthe Montana Constitution, which contains a “no-aid” provision\nbarring government aid to sectarian schools. See Mont. Code Ann.\n§15–30–3101. In full, that provision states: “ Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools . . . . The legislature, counties, cities, towns,\nschool districts, and public corporations shall not make any direct\nor indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or\nmonies, or any grant of lands or other property for any sectarian\npurpose or to aid any church, school, academy, seminary, college,\nuniversity, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled\nin whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.” Mont.\nConst., Art. X, §6(1). Shortly after the scholarship program was\ncreated, the Montana Department of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,”\nover the objection of the Montana Attorney General. That\nadministrative rule prohibited families from using scholarships at\nreligious schools. Mont. Admin. Rule §42.4.802(1)(a) (2015). It did\nso by changing the definition of “qualified education provider” to\nexclude any school “owned or controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, religious sect, or denomination.” Ibid. The\nDepartment explained that the Rule was needed to reconcile the\nscholarship program with the no-aid provision of the Montana\nConstitution. The Montana Attorney General disagreed. In a\nletter to the Department, he advised that the Montana Constitution\ndid not require excluding religious schools from the program, and\nif it did, it would “very likely” violate the United States\nConstitution by discriminating against the schools and their\nstudents. See Complaint in No. DV–15–1152A (Dist. Ct. Flathead\nCty.), Exh. 3, pp. 2, 5–6. The Attorney General is not representing\nthe Department in this case. B This suit was brought by three mothers whose\nchildren attend Stillwater Christian School in northwestern\nMontana. Stillwater is a private Christian school that meets the\nstatutory criteria for “qualified education providers.” It serves\nstudents in prekindergarten through 12th grade, and petitioners\nchose the school in large part because it “teaches the same\nChristian values that [they] teach at home.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n152; see id. , at 138, 167. The child of one petitioner has\nalready received scholarships from Big Sky, and the other\npetitioners’ children are eligible for scholarships and planned to\napply. While in effect, however, Rule 1 blocked petitioners from\nusing scholarship funds for tuition at Stillwater. To overcome that\nobstacle, petitioners sued the Department of Revenue in Montana\nstate court. Petitioners claimed that Rule 1 conflicted with the\nstatute that created the scholarship program and could not be\njustified on the ground that it was compelled by the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. Petitioners further alleged that\nthe Rule discriminated on the basis of their religious views and\nthe religious nature of the school they had chosen for their\nchildren. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, holding that it\nwas based on a mistake of law. The court explained that the Rule\nwas not required by the no-aid provision, because that provision\nprohibits only “appropriations” that aid religious schools, “not\ntax credits.” Id. , at 94. The injunctive relief freed Big Sky to award\nscholarships to students regardless of whether they attended a\nreligious or secular school. For the school year beginning in fall\n2017, Big Sky received 59 applications and ultimately awarded 44\nscholarships of $500 each. The next year, Big Sky received 90\napplications and awarded 54 scholarships of $500 each. Several\nfamilies, most with incomes of $30,000 or less, used the\nscholarships to send their children to Stillwater Christian. In December 2018, the Montana Supreme Court\nreversed the trial court. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603. The Court\nfirst addressed the scholarship program unmodified by Rule 1,\nholding that the program aided religious schools in violation of\nthe no-aid provision of the Montana Constitution. In the Court’s\nview, the no-aid provision “broadly and strictly prohibits aid to\nsectarian schools.” Id. , at 459, 435 P. 3d, at 609. The\nscholarship program provided such aid by using tax credits to\n“subsidize tuition payments” at private schools that are\n“religiously affiliated” or “controlled in whole or in part by\nchurches.” Id. , at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at 612–613. In\nthat way, the scholarship program flouted the State Constitution’s\n“guarantee to all Montanans that their government will not use\nstate funds to aid religious schools.” Id. , at 467, 435\nP. 3d, at 614. The Montana Supreme Court went on to hold that\nthe violation of the no-aid provision required invalidating the\nentire scholarship program. The Court explained that the program\nprovided “no mechanism” for preventing aid from flowing to\nreligious schools, and therefore the scholarship program could not\n“under any circumstance” be construed as consistent with the\nno-aid provision. Id. , at 466–468, 435 P. 3d, at\n613–614. As a result, the tax credit is no longer available to\nsupport scholarships at either religious or secular private\nschools. The Montana Supreme Court acknowledged that “an\noverly-broad” application of the no-aid provision “could implicate\nfree exercise concerns” and that “there may be a case” where\n“prohibiting the aid would violate the Free Exercise Clause.” Id. , at 468, 435 P. 3d, at 614. But, the Court\nconcluded, “this is not one of those cases.” Ibid. Finally, the Court agreed with petitioners that\nthe Department had exceeded its authority in promulgating\nRule 1. The Court explained that the statute creating the\nscholarship program had broadly defined qualifying schools to\ninclude all private schools, including religious ones, and the\nDepartment lacked authority to “transform” that definition with an\nadministrative rule. Id. , at 468–469, 435 P. 3d, at\n614–615. Several Justices wrote separately. All agreed\nthat Rule 1 was invalid, but they expressed differing views on\nwhether the scholarship program was consistent with the Montana and\nUnited States Constitutions. Justice Gustafson’s concurrence argued\nthat the program violated not only Montana’s no-aid provision but\nalso the Federal Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. Id. , at 475–479, 435 P. 3d, at 619–621. Justice\nSandefur echoed the majority’s conclusion that applying the no-aid\nprovision was consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, and he\ndismissed the “modern jurisprudence” of that Clause as\n“unnecessarily complicate[d]” due to “increasingly value-driven\nhairsplitting and overstretching.” Id. , at 482–484, 435\nP. 3d, at 623–624. Two Justices dissented. Justice Rice would have\nheld that the scholarship program was permissible under the no-aid\nprovision. He criticized the majority for invalidating the program\n“ sua sponte ,” contending that no party had challenged\nit under the State Constitution. Id. , at 495, 435\nP. 3d, at 631. Justice Baker also would have upheld the\nprogram. In her view, the no-aid provision did not bar the use of\nscholarships at religious schools, and free exercise concerns could\narise under the Federal Constitution if it did. Id. , at\n493–494, 435 P. 3d, at 630. We granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___\n(2019). II A The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment\nprovide that “Congress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof.” We have recognized a “ ‘play in the joints’ between what\nthe Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause\ncompels.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Locke v. Davey , 540\nU.S. 712 , 718 (2004)). Here, the parties do not dispute that\nthe scholarship program is permissible under the Establishment\nClause. Nor could they. We have repeatedly held that the\nEstablishment Clause is not offended when religious observers and\norganizations benefit from neutral government programs. See, e.g. , Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S.\n819 , 839 (1995). See also Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (noting the parties’ agreement\nthat the Establishment Clause was not violated by including\nchurches in a playground resurfacing program). Any Establishment\nClause objection to the scholarship program here is particularly\nunavailing because the government support makes its way to\nreligious schools only as a result of Montanans independently\nchoosing to spend their scholarships at such schools. See Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , 536 U.S.\n639 , 649–653 (2002). The Montana Supreme Court, however, held\nas a matter of state law that even such indirect government support\nqualified as “aid” prohibited under the Montana Constitution. The question for this Court is whether the Free\nExercise Clause precluded the Montana Supreme Court from applying\nMontana’s no-aid provision to bar religious schools from the\nscholarship program. For purposes of answering that question, we\naccept the Montana Supreme Court’s interpretation of state\nlaw—including its determination that the scholarship program\nprovided impermissible “aid” within the meaning of the Montana\nConstitution—and we assess whether excluding religious schools and\naffected families from that program was consistent with the Federal\nConstitution.[ 2 ] The Free Exercise Clause, which applies to the\nStates under the Fourteenth Amendment, “protects religious\nobservers against unequal treatment” and against “laws that impose\nspecial disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 9)\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310\nU.S. 296 , 303 (1940). Those “basic principle[s ]” have\nlong guided this Court. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 6–9). See, e.g. , Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U.S.\n1 , 16 (1947) (a State “cannot exclude individual Catholics,\nLutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers,\nPresbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of\ntheir faith, or lack of it , from receiving the benefits of\npublic welfare legislation”); Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , 449 (1988) (the Free Exercise Clause protects against laws\nthat “penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal\nshare of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other\ncitizens”). Most recently, Trinity Lutheran distilled\nthese and other decisions to the same effect into the\n“unremarkable” conclusion that disqualifying otherwise eligible\nrecipients from a public benefit “solely because of their religious\ncharacter” imposes “a penalty on the free exercise of religion that\ntriggers the most exacting scrutiny.” 582 U. S., at ___–___\n(slip op., at 9–10). In Trinity Lutheran , Missouri provided\ngrants to help nonprofit organizations pay for playground\nresurfacing, but a state policy disqualified any organization\n“owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 2). Because of that policy, an\notherwise eligible church-owned preschool was denied a grant to\nresurface its playground. Missouri’s policy discriminated against\nthe Church “simply because of what it is—a church,” and so the\npolicy was subject to the “strictest scrutiny,” which it failed. Id. , at ___–___ (slip op., at 11–15). We acknowledged that\nthe State had not “criminalized” the way in which the Church\nworshipped or “told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a\ncertain view of the Gospel.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 11).\nBut the State’s discriminatory policy was “odious to our\nConstitution all the same.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at\n15). Here too Montana’s no-aid provision bars\nreligious schools from public benefits solely because of the\nreligious character of the schools. The provision also bars parents\nwho wish to send their children to a religious school from those\nsame benefits, again solely because of the religious character of\nthe school. This is apparent from the plain text. The provision\nbars aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination.” Mont. Const., Art. X, §6(1).\nThe provision’s title—“Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools”—confirms that the provision singles out schools based on\ntheir religious character. Ibid. And the Montana Supreme\nCourt explained that the provision forbids aid to any school that\nis “sectarian,” “religiously affiliated,” or “controlled in whole\nor in part by churches.” 393 Mont., at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at\n612–613. The provision plainly excludes schools from government aid\nsolely because of religious status. See Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–10). The Department counters that Trinity\nLutheran does not govern here because the no-aid provision\napplies not because of the religious character of the recipients,\nbut because of how the funds would be used—for “religious\neducation.” Brief for Respondents 38. In Trinity Lutheran , a\nmajority of the Court concluded that the Missouri policy violated\nthe Free Exercise Clause because it discriminated on the basis of\nreligious status. A plurality declined to address discrimination\nwith respect to “religious uses of funding or other forms of\ndiscrimination.” 582 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 14, n.\n3). The plurality saw no need to consider such concerns because\nMissouri had expressly discriminated “based on religious identity,” ibid. , which was enough to invalidate the state policy\nwithout addressing how government funds were used. This case also turns expressly on religious\nstatus and not religious use. The Montana Supreme Court applied the\nno-aid provision solely by reference to religious status. The Court\nrepeatedly explained that the no-aid provision bars aid to “schools\ncontrolled in whole or in part by churches,” “sectarian schools,”\nand “religiously-affiliated schools.” 393 Mont., at 463–467, 435\nP. 3d, at 611–613. Applying this provision to the scholarship\nprogram, the Montana Supreme Court noted that most of the private\nschools that would benefit from the program were “religiously\naffiliated” and “controlled by churches,” and the Court ultimately\nconcluded that the scholarship program ran afoul of the Montana\nConstitution by aiding “schools controlled by churches.” Id. , at 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 613–614. The Montana\nConstitution discriminates based on religious status just like the\nMissouri policy in Trinity Lutheran , which excluded\norganizations “owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other\nreligious entity.” 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). The Department points to some language in the\ndecision below indicating that the no-aid provision has the goal or\neffect of ensuring that government aid does not end up being used\nfor “sectarian education” or “religious education.” 393 Mont., at\n460, 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 609, 613–614. The Department also\ncontrasts what it characterizes as the “completely non-religious”\nbenefit of playground resurfacing in Trinity Lutheran with\nthe unrestricted tuition aid at issue here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.\nGeneral school aid, the Department stresses, could be used for\nreligious ends by some recipients, particularly schools that\nbelieve faith should “ permeate [ ]” everything they do.\nBrief for Respondents 39 (quoting State ex rel. Chambers v. School Dist. No. 10 , 155 Mont. 422, 438, 472 P.2d 1013 , 1021 (1970)). See also post , at 8, 13\n(Breyer, J., dissenting). Regardless, those considerations were not the\nMontana Supreme Court’s basis for applying the no-aid provision to\nexclude religious schools; that hinged solely on religious status.\nStatus-based discrimination remains status based even if one of its\ngoals or effects is preventing religious organizations from putting\naid to religious uses. Undeterred by Trinity Lutheran , the\nMontana Supreme Court applied the no-aid provision to hold that\nreligious schools could not benefit from the scholarship program.\n393 Mont., at 464–468, 435 P. 3d, at 612–614. So applied, the\nprovision “impose[s] special disabilities on the basis of religious\nstatus” and “condition[s] the availability of benefits upon a\nrecipient’s willingness to surrender [its] religiously impelled\nstatus.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 9–10) (quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508\nU.S. 520 , 533 (1993), and McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U.S.\n618 , 626 (1978) (plurality opinion) (alterations omitted)). To\nbe eligible for government aid under the Montana Constitution, a\nschool must divorce itself from any religious control or\naffiliation. Placing such a condition on benefits or privileges\n“inevitably deters or discourages the exercise of First Amendment\nrights.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S.\n398 , 405 (1963) (alterations omitted)). The Free Exercise\nClause protects against even “indirect coercion,” and a State\n“punishe[s] the free exercise of religion” by disqualifying the\nreligious from government aid as Montana did here. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Such status-based\ndiscrimination is subject to “the strictest scrutiny.” Id. ,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). None of this is meant to suggest that we agree\nwith the Department, Brief for Respondents 36–40, that some lesser\ndegree of scrutiny applies to discrimination against religious uses\nof government aid. See Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546\n(striking down law designed to ban religious practice involving\nalleged animal cruelty, explaining that a law “target[ing]\nreligious conduct for distinctive treatment or advanc[ing]\nlegitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a\nreligious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare\ncases”). Some Members of the Court, moreover, have questioned\nwhether there is a meaningful distinction between discrimination\nbased on use or conduct and that based on status. See Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2)\n(Gorsuch, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in part) (citing, e.g. , Lukumi , 508 U.S.\n520 , and Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment\nSecurity Div. , 450 U.S.\n707 (1981)). We acknowledge the point but need not examine it\nhere. It is enough in this case to conclude that strict scrutiny\napplies under Trinity Lutheran because Montana’s no-aid\nprovision discriminates based on religious status. B Seeking to avoid Trinity Lutheran , the\nDepartment contends that this case is instead governed by Locke v. Davey , 540 U.S.\n712 (2004). See also post , at 5 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting); post , at 9 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Locke also involved a scholarship program. The State of\nWashington provided scholarships paid out of the State’s general\nfund to help students pursuing postsecondary education. The\nscholarships could be used at accredited religious and nonreligious\nschools alike, but Washington prohibited students from using the\nscholarships to pursue devotional theology degrees, which prepared\nstudents for a calling as clergy. This prohibition prevented Davey\nfrom using his scholarship to obtain a degree that would have\nenabled him to become a pastor. We held that Washington had not\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. Locke differs from this case in two\ncritical ways. First, Locke explained that Washington had\n“merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction”: the\n“essentially religious endeavor” of training a minister “to lead a\ncongregation.” Id. , at 721. Thus, Davey “was denied a\nscholarship because of what he proposed to do —use the funds\nto prepare for the ministry.” Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Apart from that narrow\nrestriction, Washington’s program allowed scholarships to be used\nat “pervasively religious schools” that incorporated religious\ninstruction throughout their classes. Locke , 540 U. S.,\nat 724–725. By contrast, Montana’s Constitution does not zero in on\nany particular “essentially religious” course of instruction at a\nreligious school. Rather, as we have explained, the no-aid\nprovision bars all aid to a religious school “simply because of\nwhat it is,” putting the school to a choice between being religious\nor receiving government benefits. Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). At the same time, the\nprovision puts families to a choice between sending their children\nto a religious school or receiving such benefits. Second, Locke invoked a “historic and\nsubstantial” state interest in not funding the training of clergy,\n540 U. S., at 725, explaining that “opposition to\n. . . funding ‘to support church leaders’ lay at the\nhistoric core of the Religion Clauses,” Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting Locke , 540\nU. S., at 722). As evidence of that tradition, the Court in Locke emphasized that the propriety of state-supported\nclergy was a central subject of founding-era debates, and that most\nstate constitutions from that era prohibited the expenditure of tax\ndollars to support the clergy. See id. , at 722–723. But no comparable “historic and substantial”\ntradition supports Montana’s decision to disqualify religious\nschools from government aid. In the founding era and the early 19th\ncentury, governments provided financial support to private schools,\nincluding denominational ones. “Far from prohibiting such support,\nthe early state constitutions and statutes actively encouraged this\npolicy.” L. Jorgenson, The State and the Non-Public School,\n1825–1925, p. 4 (1987); e.g., R. Gabel, Public Funds for\nChurch and Private Schools 210, 217–218, 221, 241–243 (1937); C.\nKaestle, Pillars of the Republic: Common Schools and American\nSociety, 1760–1860, pp. 166–167 (1983). Local governments provided\ngrants to private schools, including religious ones, for the\neducation of the poor. M. McConnell, et al., Religion and the\nConstitution 318–319 (4th ed. 2016). Even States with bans on\ngovernment-supported clergy, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\nGeorgia, provided various forms of aid to religious schools.\n See Kaestle, supra , at 166–167; Gabel, supra ,\nat 215–218, 241–245, 372–374; cf. Locke , 540 U. S., at\n723. Early federal aid (often land grants) went to religious\nschools. McConnell, supra , at 319. Congress provided support\nto denominational schools in the District of Columbia until 1848, ibid. , and Congress paid churches to run schools for\nAmerican Indians through the end of the 19th century, see Quick\nBear v. Leupp , 210 U.S.\n50 , 78 (1908); Gabel, supra , at 521–523. After the Civil\nWar, Congress spent large sums on education for emancipated\nfreedmen, often by supporting denominational schools in the South\nthrough the Freedmen’s Bureau. McConnell, supra , at\n323.[ 3 ] The Department argues that a tradition against state support for religious schools arose in the\nsecond half of the 19th century, as more than 30 States—including\nMontana—adopted no-aid provisions. See Brief for Respondents 40–42\nand App. D. Such a development, of course, cannot by itself\nestablish an early American tradition. Justice Sotomayor questions\nour reliance on aid provided during the same era by the Freedmen’s\nBureau, post , at 10 (dissenting opinion), but we see no\ninconsistency in recognizing that such evidence may reinforce an\nearly practice but cannot create one. In addition, many of the\nno-aid provisions belong to a more checkered tradition shared with\nthe Blaine Amendment of the 1870s. That proposal—which Congress\nnearly passed—would have added to the Federal Constitution a\nprovision similar to the state no-aid provisions, prohibiting\n",

MONTANA\nDEPARTMENT OF REVENUE et al. certiorari to the supreme court of montana No. 18–1195. Argued January 22, 2020—Decided\nJune 30, 2020 The Montana Legislature established a program\nthat grants tax credits to those who donate to organizations that\naward scholarships for private school tuition. To reconcile the\nprogram with a provision of the Montana Constitution that bars\ngovernment aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination,” Art. X, §6(1), the Montana\nDepartment of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,” which prohibited\nfamilies from using the scholarships at religious schools. Three\nmothers who were blocked by Rule 1 from using scholarship funds for\ntheir children’s tuition at Stillwater Christian School sued the\nDepartment in state court, alleging that the Rule discriminated on\nthe basis of their religious views and the religious nature of the\nschool they had chosen. The trial court enjoined Rule 1. Reversing,\nthe Montana Supreme Court held that the program, unmodified by Rule\n1, aided religious schools in violation of the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. The Court further held that the\nviolation required invalidating the entire program. Held : The application of the\nno-aid provision discriminated against religious schools and the\nfamilies whose children attend or hope to attend them in violation\nof the Free Exercise Clause of the Federal Constitution.\nPp. 6–22. (a) The Free Exercise Clause “protects\nreligious observers against unequal treatment” and against “laws\nthat impose special disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer ,\n582 U. S. ___, ___. In Trinity Lutheran , this Court\nheld that disqualifying otherwise eligible recipients from a public\nbenefit “solely because of their religious character” imposes “a\npenalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most\nexacting scrutiny.” Id. , at ___. Here, the application of\nMontana’s no-aid provision excludes religious schools from public\nbenefits solely because of religious status. As a result, strict\nscrutiny applies. Pp. 6–12. (b) Contrary to the Department’s\ncontention, this case is not governed by Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S.\n712 . The plaintiff in Locke was denied a scholarship\n“because of what he proposed to do —use the funds to prepare\nfor the ministry,” an essentially religious endeavor. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. By contrast, Montana’s no-aid\nprovision does not zero in on any essentially religious course of\ninstruction but rather bars aid to a religious school “simply\nbecause of what it is”—a religious school. Id. , at ___. Locke also invoked a “historic and substantial” state\ninterest in not funding the training of clergy, 540 U. S., at\n725, but no comparable tradition supports Montana’s decision to\ndisqualify religious schools from government aid.\nPp. 12–16. (c) The proposed alternative approach\ninvolving a flexible case-by-case analysis is inconsistent with Trinity Lutheran . The protections of the Free Exercise\nClause do not depend on a varying case-by-case analysis regarding\nwhether discrimination against religious adherents would serve\nill-defined interests. Pp. 16–18. (d) To satisfy strict scrutiny, government\naction “must advance ‘interests of the highest order’ and must be\nnarrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.” Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546. Montana’s interest in creating greater separation of\nchurch and State than the Federal Constitution requires “cannot\nqualify as compelling” in the face of the infringement of free\nexercise here. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. The\nDepartment’s argument that the no-aid provision actually promotes\nreligious freedom is unavailing because an infringement of First\nAmendment rights cannot be justified by a State’s alternative view\nthat the infringement advances religious liberty. The Department’s\nargument is especially unconvincing because the infringement here\nbroadly burdens not only religious schools but also the families\nwhose children attend them. The Department suggests that the no-aid\nprovision safeguards public education by ensuring that government\nsupport is not diverted to private schools, but that interest does\nnot justify a no-aid provision that requires only religious private\nschools to bear its weight. Pp. 18–20. (e) Because the Free Exercise Clause\nbarred the application of the no-aid provision here, the Montana\nSupreme Court had no authority to invalidate the program on the\nbasis of that provision. The Department argues that the\ninvalidation of the entire program prevented a free exercise\nviolation, but the Department overlooks the Montana Supreme Court’s\nthreshold error of federal law. Had the Montana Supreme Court\nrecognized that the application of the no-aid provision was barred\nby the Free Exercise Clause, the Court would have had no basis for\ninvalidating the program. The Court was obligated to disregard the\nno-aid provision and decide this case consistent with the Federal\nConstitution. Pp. 20–22. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603, reversed and\nremanded. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, in which Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ.,\njoined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Gorsuch,\nJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 18–1195 _________________ KENDRA ESPINOZA, et al., PETITIONERS v. MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, et al. on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmontana [June 30, 2020] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. The Montana Legislature established a program to\nprovide tuition assistance to parents who send their children to\nprivate schools. The program grants a tax credit to anyone who\ndonates to certain organizations that in turn award scholarships to\nselected students attending such schools. When petitioners sought\nto use the scholarships at a religious school, the Montana Supreme\nCourt struck down the program. The Court relied on the “no-aid”\nprovision of the State Constitution, which prohibits any aid to a\nschool controlled by a “church, sect, or denomination.” The\nquestion presented is whether the Free Exercise Clause of the\nUnited States Constitution barred that application of the no-aid\nprovision. I A In 2015, the Montana Legislature sought “to\nprovide parental and student choice in education” by enacting a\nscholarship program for students attending private schools. 2015\nMont. Laws p. 2168, §7. The program grants a tax credit of up to\n$150 to any taxpayer who donates to a participating “student\nscholarship organization.” Mont. Code Ann. §§15–30–3103(1),\n–3111(1) (2019). The scholarship organizations then use the\ndonations to award scholarships to children for tuition at a\nprivate school. §§15–30–3102(7)(a), –3103(1)(c).[ 1 ] So far only one scholarship organization, Big\nSky Scholarships, has participated in the program. Big Sky focuses\non providing scholarships to families who face financial hardship\nor have children with disabilities. Scholarship organizations like\nBig Sky must, among other requirements, maintain an application\nprocess for awarding the scholarships; use at least 90% of all\ndonations on scholarship awards; and comply with state reporting\nand monitoring requirements. §§15–30–3103(1), –3105(1),\n–3113(1). A family whose child is awarded a scholarship\nunder the program may use it at any “qualified education\nprovider”—that is, any private school that meets certain\naccreditation, testing, and safety requirements. See\n§15–30–3102(7). Virtually every private school in Montana\nqualifies. Upon receiving a scholarship, the family designates its\nschool of choice, and the scholarship organization sends the\nscholarship funds directly to the school. §15–30–3104(1). Neither\nthe scholarship organization nor its donors can restrict awards to\nparticular types of schools. See §§15–30–3103(1)(b), –3111(1). The Montana Legislature allotted $3 million\nannually to fund the tax credits, beginning in 2016.\n§15–30–3111(5)(a). If the annual allotment is exhausted, it\nincreases by 10% the following year. Ibid. The program is\nslated to expire in 2023. 2015 Mont. Laws p. 2186, §33. The Montana Legislature also directed that the\nprogram be administered in accordance with Article X, section 6, of\nthe Montana Constitution, which contains a “no-aid” provision\nbarring government aid to sectarian schools. See Mont. Code Ann.\n§15–30–3101. In full, that provision states: “ Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools . . . . The legislature, counties, cities, towns,\nschool districts, and public corporations shall not make any direct\nor indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or\nmonies, or any grant of lands or other property for any sectarian\npurpose or to aid any church, school, academy, seminary, college,\nuniversity, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled\nin whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.” Mont.\nConst., Art. X, §6(1). Shortly after the scholarship program was\ncreated, the Montana Department of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,”\nover the objection of the Montana Attorney General. That\nadministrative rule prohibited families from using scholarships at\nreligious schools. Mont. Admin. Rule §42.4.802(1)(a) (2015). It did\nso by changing the definition of “qualified education provider” to\nexclude any school “owned or controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, religious sect, or denomination.” Ibid. The\nDepartment explained that the Rule was needed to reconcile the\nscholarship program with the no-aid provision of the Montana\nConstitution. The Montana Attorney General disagreed. In a\nletter to the Department, he advised that the Montana Constitution\ndid not require excluding religious schools from the program, and\nif it did, it would “very likely” violate the United States\nConstitution by discriminating against the schools and their\nstudents. See Complaint in No. DV–15–1152A (Dist. Ct. Flathead\nCty.), Exh. 3, pp. 2, 5–6. The Attorney General is not representing\nthe Department in this case. B This suit was brought by three mothers whose\nchildren attend Stillwater Christian School in northwestern\nMontana. Stillwater is a private Christian school that meets the\nstatutory criteria for “qualified education providers.” It serves\nstudents in prekindergarten through 12th grade, and petitioners\nchose the school in large part because it “teaches the same\nChristian values that [they] teach at home.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n152; see id. , at 138, 167. The child of one petitioner has\nalready received scholarships from Big Sky, and the other\npetitioners’ children are eligible for scholarships and planned to\napply. While in effect, however, Rule 1 blocked petitioners from\nusing scholarship funds for tuition at Stillwater. To overcome that\nobstacle, petitioners sued the Department of Revenue in Montana\nstate court. Petitioners claimed that Rule 1 conflicted with the\nstatute that created the scholarship program and could not be\njustified on the ground that it was compelled by the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. Petitioners further alleged that\nthe Rule discriminated on the basis of their religious views and\nthe religious nature of the school they had chosen for their\nchildren. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, holding that it\nwas based on a mistake of law. The court explained that the Rule\nwas not required by the no-aid provision, because that provision\nprohibits only “appropriations” that aid religious schools, “not\ntax credits.” Id. , at 94. The injunctive relief freed Big Sky to award\nscholarships to students regardless of whether they attended a\nreligious or secular school. For the school year beginning in fall\n2017, Big Sky received 59 applications and ultimately awarded 44\nscholarships of $500 each. The next year, Big Sky received 90\napplications and awarded 54 scholarships of $500 each. Several\nfamilies, most with incomes of $30,000 or less, used the\nscholarships to send their children to Stillwater Christian. In December 2018, the Montana Supreme Court\nreversed the trial court. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603. The Court\nfirst addressed the scholarship program unmodified by Rule 1,\nholding that the program aided religious schools in violation of\nthe no-aid provision of the Montana Constitution. In the Court’s\nview, the no-aid provision “broadly and strictly prohibits aid to\nsectarian schools.” Id. , at 459, 435 P. 3d, at 609. The\nscholarship program provided such aid by using tax credits to\n“subsidize tuition payments” at private schools that are\n“religiously affiliated” or “controlled in whole or in part by\nchurches.” Id. , at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at 612–613. In\nthat way, the scholarship program flouted the State Constitution’s\n“guarantee to all Montanans that their government will not use\nstate funds to aid religious schools.” Id. , at 467, 435\nP. 3d, at 614. The Montana Supreme Court went on to hold that\nthe violation of the no-aid provision required invalidating the\nentire scholarship program. The Court explained that the program\nprovided “no mechanism” for preventing aid from flowing to\nreligious schools, and therefore the scholarship program could not\n“under any circumstance” be construed as consistent with the\nno-aid provision. Id. , at 466–468, 435 P. 3d, at\n613–614. As a result, the tax credit is no longer available to\nsupport scholarships at either religious or secular private\nschools. The Montana Supreme Court acknowledged that “an\noverly-broad” application of the no-aid provision “could implicate\nfree exercise concerns” and that “there may be a case” where\n“prohibiting the aid would violate the Free Exercise Clause.” Id. , at 468, 435 P. 3d, at 614. But, the Court\nconcluded, “this is not one of those cases.” Ibid. Finally, the Court agreed with petitioners that\nthe Department had exceeded its authority in promulgating\nRule 1. The Court explained that the statute creating the\nscholarship program had broadly defined qualifying schools to\ninclude all private schools, including religious ones, and the\nDepartment lacked authority to “transform” that definition with an\nadministrative rule. Id. , at 468–469, 435 P. 3d, at\n614–615. Several Justices wrote separately. All agreed\nthat Rule 1 was invalid, but they expressed differing views on\nwhether the scholarship program was consistent with the Montana and\nUnited States Constitutions. Justice Gustafson’s concurrence argued\nthat the program violated not only Montana’s no-aid provision but\nalso the Federal Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. Id. , at 475–479, 435 P. 3d, at 619–621. Justice\nSandefur echoed the majority’s conclusion that applying the no-aid\nprovision was consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, and he\ndismissed the “modern jurisprudence” of that Clause as\n“unnecessarily complicate[d]” due to “increasingly value-driven\nhairsplitting and overstretching.” Id. , at 482–484, 435\nP. 3d, at 623–624. Two Justices dissented. Justice Rice would have\nheld that the scholarship program was permissible under the no-aid\nprovision. He criticized the majority for invalidating the program\n“ sua sponte ,” contending that no party had challenged\nit under the State Constitution. Id. , at 495, 435\nP. 3d, at 631. Justice Baker also would have upheld the\nprogram. In her view, the no-aid provision did not bar the use of\nscholarships at religious schools, and free exercise concerns could\narise under the Federal Constitution if it did. Id. , at\n493–494, 435 P. 3d, at 630. We granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___\n(2019). II A The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment\nprovide that “Congress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof.” We have recognized a “ ‘play in the joints’ between what\nthe Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause\ncompels.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Locke v. Davey , 540\nU.S. 712 , 718 (2004)). Here, the parties do not dispute that\nthe scholarship program is permissible under the Establishment\nClause. Nor could they. We have repeatedly held that the\nEstablishment Clause is not offended when religious observers and\norganizations benefit from neutral government programs. See, e.g. , Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S.\n819 , 839 (1995). See also Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (noting the parties’ agreement\nthat the Establishment Clause was not violated by including\nchurches in a playground resurfacing program). Any Establishment\nClause objection to the scholarship program here is particularly\nunavailing because the government support makes its way to\nreligious schools only as a result of Montanans independently\nchoosing to spend their scholarships at such schools. See Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , 536 U.S.\n639 , 649–653 (2002). The Montana Supreme Court, however, held\nas a matter of state law that even such indirect government support\nqualified as “aid” prohibited under the Montana Constitution. The question for this Court is whether the Free\nExercise Clause precluded the Montana Supreme Court from applying\nMontana’s no-aid provision to bar religious schools from the\nscholarship program. For purposes of answering that question, we\naccept the Montana Supreme Court’s interpretation of state\nlaw—including its determination that the scholarship program\nprovided impermissible “aid” within the meaning of the Montana\nConstitution—and we assess whether excluding religious schools and\naffected families from that program was consistent with the Federal\nConstitution.[ 2 ] The Free Exercise Clause, which applies to the\nStates under the Fourteenth Amendment, “protects religious\nobservers against unequal treatment” and against “laws that impose\nspecial disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 9)\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310\nU.S. 296 , 303 (1940). Those “basic principle[s ]” have\nlong guided this Court. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 6–9). See, e.g. , Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U.S.\n1 , 16 (1947) (a State “cannot exclude individual Catholics,\nLutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers,\nPresbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of\ntheir faith, or lack of it , from receiving the benefits of\npublic welfare legislation”); Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , 449 (1988) (the Free Exercise Clause protects against laws\nthat “penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal\nshare of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other\ncitizens”). Most recently, Trinity Lutheran distilled\nthese and other decisions to the same effect into the\n“unremarkable” conclusion that disqualifying otherwise eligible\nrecipients from a public benefit “solely because of their religious\ncharacter” imposes “a penalty on the free exercise of religion that\ntriggers the most exacting scrutiny.” 582 U. S., at ___–___\n(slip op., at 9–10). In Trinity Lutheran , Missouri provided\ngrants to help nonprofit organizations pay for playground\nresurfacing, but a state policy disqualified any organization\n“owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 2). Because of that policy, an\notherwise eligible church-owned preschool was denied a grant to\nresurface its playground. Missouri’s policy discriminated against\nthe Church “simply because of what it is—a church,” and so the\npolicy was subject to the “strictest scrutiny,” which it failed. Id. , at ___–___ (slip op., at 11–15). We acknowledged that\nthe State had not “criminalized” the way in which the Church\nworshipped or “told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a\ncertain view of the Gospel.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 11).\nBut the State’s discriminatory policy was “odious to our\nConstitution all the same.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at\n15). Here too Montana’s no-aid provision bars\nreligious schools from public benefits solely because of the\nreligious character of the schools. The provision also bars parents\nwho wish to send their children to a religious school from those\nsame benefits, again solely because of the religious character of\nthe school. This is apparent from the plain text. The provision\nbars aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination.” Mont. Const., Art. X, §6(1).\nThe provision’s title—“Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools”—confirms that the provision singles out schools based on\ntheir religious character. Ibid. And the Montana Supreme\nCourt explained that the provision forbids aid to any school that\nis “sectarian,” “religiously affiliated,” or “controlled in whole\nor in part by churches.” 393 Mont., at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at\n612–613. The provision plainly excludes schools from government aid\nsolely because of religious status. See Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–10). The Department counters that Trinity\nLutheran does not govern here because the no-aid provision\napplies not because of the religious character of the recipients,\nbut because of how the funds would be used—for “religious\neducation.” Brief for Respondents 38. In Trinity Lutheran , a\nmajority of the Court concluded that the Missouri policy violated\nthe Free Exercise Clause because it discriminated on the basis of\nreligious status. A plurality declined to address discrimination\nwith respect to “religious uses of funding or other forms of\ndiscrimination.” 582 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 14, n.\n3). The plurality saw no need to consider such concerns because\nMissouri had expressly discriminated “based on religious identity,” ibid. , which was enough to invalidate the state policy\nwithout addressing how government funds were used. This case also turns expressly on religious\nstatus and not religious use. The Montana Supreme Court applied the\nno-aid provision solely by reference to religious status. The Court\nrepeatedly explained that the no-aid provision bars aid to “schools\ncontrolled in whole or in part by churches,” “sectarian schools,”\nand “religiously-affiliated schools.” 393 Mont., at 463–467, 435\nP. 3d, at 611–613. Applying this provision to the scholarship\nprogram, the Montana Supreme Court noted that most of the private\nschools that would benefit from the program were “religiously\naffiliated” and “controlled by churches,” and the Court ultimately\nconcluded that the scholarship program ran afoul of the Montana\nConstitution by aiding “schools controlled by churches.” Id. , at 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 613–614. The Montana\nConstitution discriminates based on religious status just like the\nMissouri policy in Trinity Lutheran , which excluded\norganizations “owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other\nreligious entity.” 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). The Department points to some language in the\ndecision below indicating that the no-aid provision has the goal or\neffect of ensuring that government aid does not end up being used\nfor “sectarian education” or “religious education.” 393 Mont., at\n460, 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 609, 613–614. The Department also\ncontrasts what it characterizes as the “completely non-religious”\nbenefit of playground resurfacing in Trinity Lutheran with\nthe unrestricted tuition aid at issue here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.\nGeneral school aid, the Department stresses, could be used for\nreligious ends by some recipients, particularly schools that\nbelieve faith should “ permeate [ ]” everything they do.\nBrief for Respondents 39 (quoting State ex rel. Chambers v. School Dist. No. 10 , 155 Mont. 422, 438, 472 P.2d 1013 , 1021 (1970)). See also post , at 8, 13\n(Breyer, J., dissenting). Regardless, those considerations were not the\nMontana Supreme Court’s basis for applying the no-aid provision to\nexclude religious schools; that hinged solely on religious status.\nStatus-based discrimination remains status based even if one of its\ngoals or effects is preventing religious organizations from putting\naid to religious uses. Undeterred by Trinity Lutheran , the\nMontana Supreme Court applied the no-aid provision to hold that\nreligious schools could not benefit from the scholarship program.\n393 Mont., at 464–468, 435 P. 3d, at 612–614. So applied, the\nprovision “impose[s] special disabilities on the basis of religious\nstatus” and “condition[s] the availability of benefits upon a\nrecipient’s willingness to surrender [its] religiously impelled\nstatus.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 9–10) (quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508\nU.S. 520 , 533 (1993), and McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U.S.\n618 , 626 (1978) (plurality opinion) (alterations omitted)). To\nbe eligible for government aid under the Montana Constitution, a\nschool must divorce itself from any religious control or\naffiliation. Placing such a condition on benefits or privileges\n“inevitably deters or discourages the exercise of First Amendment\nrights.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S.\n398 , 405 (1963) (alterations omitted)). The Free Exercise\nClause protects against even “indirect coercion,” and a State\n“punishe[s] the free exercise of religion” by disqualifying the\nreligious from government aid as Montana did here. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Such status-based\ndiscrimination is subject to “the strictest scrutiny.” Id. ,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). None of this is meant to suggest that we agree\nwith the Department, Brief for Respondents 36–40, that some lesser\ndegree of scrutiny applies to discrimination against religious uses\nof government aid. See Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546\n(striking down law designed to ban religious practice involving\nalleged animal cruelty, explaining that a law “target[ing]\nreligious conduct for distinctive treatment or advanc[ing]\nlegitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a\nreligious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare\ncases”). Some Members of the Court, moreover, have questioned\nwhether there is a meaningful distinction between discrimination\nbased on use or conduct and that based on status. See Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2)\n(Gorsuch, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in part) (citing, e.g. , Lukumi , 508 U.S.\n520 , and Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment\nSecurity Div. , 450 U.S.\n707 (1981)). We acknowledge the point but need not examine it\nhere. It is enough in this case to conclude that strict scrutiny\napplies under Trinity Lutheran because Montana’s no-aid\nprovision discriminates based on religious status. B Seeking to avoid Trinity Lutheran , the\nDepartment contends that this case is instead governed by Locke v. Davey , 540 U.S.\n712 (2004). See also post , at 5 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting); post , at 9 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Locke also involved a scholarship program. The State of\nWashington provided scholarships paid out of the State’s general\nfund to help students pursuing postsecondary education. The\nscholarships could be used at accredited religious and nonreligious\nschools alike, but Washington prohibited students from using the\nscholarships to pursue devotional theology degrees, which prepared\nstudents for a calling as clergy. This prohibition prevented Davey\nfrom using his scholarship to obtain a degree that would have\nenabled him to become a pastor. We held that Washington had not\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. Locke differs from this case in two\ncritical ways. First, Locke explained that Washington had\n“merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction”: the\n“essentially religious endeavor” of training a minister “to lead a\ncongregation.” Id. , at 721. Thus, Davey “was denied a\nscholarship because of what he proposed to do —use the funds\nto prepare for the ministry.” Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Apart from that narrow\nrestriction, Washington’s program allowed scholarships to be used\nat “pervasively religious schools” that incorporated religious\ninstruction throughout their classes. Locke , 540 U. S.,\nat 724–725. By contrast, Montana’s Constitution does not zero in on\nany particular “essentially religious” course of instruction at a\nreligious school. Rather, as we have explained, the no-aid\nprovision bars all aid to a religious school “simply because of\nwhat it is,” putting the school to a choice between being religious\nor receiving government benefits. Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). At the same time, the\nprovision puts families to a choice between sending their children\nto a religious school or receiving such benefits. Second, Locke invoked a “historic and\nsubstantial” state interest in not funding the training of clergy,\n540 U. S., at 725, explaining that “opposition to\n. . . funding ‘to support church leaders’ lay at the\nhistoric core of the Religion Clauses,” Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting Locke , 540\nU. S., at 722). As evidence of that tradition, the Court in Locke emphasized that the propriety of state-supported\nclergy was a central subject of founding-era debates, and that most\nstate constitutions from that era prohibited the expenditure of tax\ndollars to support the clergy. See id. , at 722–723. But no comparable “historic and substantial”\ntradition supports Montana’s decision to disqualify religious\nschools from government aid. In the founding era and the early 19th\ncentury, governments provided financial support to private schools,\nincluding denominational ones. “Far from prohibiting such support,\nthe early state constitutions and statutes actively encouraged this\npolicy.” L. Jorgenson, The State and the Non-Public School,\n1825–1925, p. 4 (1987); e.g., R. Gabel, Public Funds for\nChurch and Private Schools 210, 217–218, 221, 241–243 (1937); C.\nKaestle, Pillars of the Republic: Common Schools and American\nSociety, 1760–1860, pp. 166–167 (1983). Local governments provided\ngrants to private schools, including religious ones, for the\neducation of the poor. M. McConnell, et al., Religion and the\nConstitution 318–319 (4th ed. 2016). Even States with bans on\ngovernment-supported clergy, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\nGeorgia, provided various forms of aid to religious schools.\n See Kaestle, supra , at 166–167; Gabel, supra ,\nat 215–218, 241–245, 372–374; cf. Locke , 540 U. S., at\n723. Early federal aid (often land grants) went to religious\nschools. McConnell, supra , at 319. Congress provided support\nto denominational schools in the District of Columbia until 1848, ibid. , and Congress paid churches to run schools for\nAmerican Indians through the end of the 19th century, see Quick\nBear v. Leupp , 210 U.S.\n50 , 78 (1908); Gabel, supra , at 521–523. After the Civil\nWar, Congress spent large sums on education for emancipated\nfreedmen, often by supporting denominational schools in the South\nthrough the Freedmen’s Bureau. McConnell, supra , at\n323.[ 3 ] The Department argues that a tradition against state support for religious schools arose in the\nsecond half of the 19th century, as more than 30 States—including\nMontana—adopted no-aid provisions. See Brief for Respondents 40–42\nand App. D. Such a development, of course, cannot by itself\nestablish an early American tradition. Justice Sotomayor questions\nour reliance on aid provided during the same era by the Freedmen’s\nBureau, post , at 10 (dissenting opinion), but we see no\ninconsistency in recognizing that such evidence may reinforce an\nearly practice but cannot create one. In addition, many of the\nno-aid provisions belong to a more checkered tradition shared with\nthe Blaine Amendment of the 1870s. That proposal—which Congress\nnearly passed—would have added to the Federal Constitution a\nprovision similar to the state no-aid provisions, prohibiting\n",

MONTANA\nDEPARTMENT OF REVENUE et al. certiorari to the supreme court of montana No. 18–1195. Argued January 22, 2020—Decided\nJune 30, 2020 The Montana Legislature established a program\nthat grants tax credits to those who donate to organizations that\naward scholarships for private school tuition. To reconcile the\nprogram with a provision of the Montana Constitution that bars\ngovernment aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination,” Art. X, §6(1), the Montana\nDepartment of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,” which prohibited\nfamilies from using the scholarships at religious schools. Three\nmothers who were blocked by Rule 1 from using scholarship funds for\ntheir children’s tuition at Stillwater Christian School sued the\nDepartment in state court, alleging that the Rule discriminated on\nthe basis of their religious views and the religious nature of the\nschool they had chosen. The trial court enjoined Rule 1. Reversing,\nthe Montana Supreme Court held that the program, unmodified by Rule\n1, aided religious schools in violation of the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. The Court further held that the\nviolation required invalidating the entire program. Held : The application of the\nno-aid provision discriminated against religious schools and the\nfamilies whose children attend or hope to attend them in violation\nof the Free Exercise Clause of the Federal Constitution.\nPp. 6–22. (a) The Free Exercise Clause “protects\nreligious observers against unequal treatment” and against “laws\nthat impose special disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer ,\n582 U. S. ___, ___. In Trinity Lutheran , this Court\nheld that disqualifying otherwise eligible recipients from a public\nbenefit “solely because of their religious character” imposes “a\npenalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most\nexacting scrutiny.” Id. , at ___. Here, the application of\nMontana’s no-aid provision excludes religious schools from public\nbenefits solely because of religious status. As a result, strict\nscrutiny applies. Pp. 6–12. (b) Contrary to the Department’s\ncontention, this case is not governed by Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S.\n712 . The plaintiff in Locke was denied a scholarship\n“because of what he proposed to do —use the funds to prepare\nfor the ministry,” an essentially religious endeavor. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. By contrast, Montana’s no-aid\nprovision does not zero in on any essentially religious course of\ninstruction but rather bars aid to a religious school “simply\nbecause of what it is”—a religious school. Id. , at ___. Locke also invoked a “historic and substantial” state\ninterest in not funding the training of clergy, 540 U. S., at\n725, but no comparable tradition supports Montana’s decision to\ndisqualify religious schools from government aid.\nPp. 12–16. (c) The proposed alternative approach\ninvolving a flexible case-by-case analysis is inconsistent with Trinity Lutheran . The protections of the Free Exercise\nClause do not depend on a varying case-by-case analysis regarding\nwhether discrimination against religious adherents would serve\nill-defined interests. Pp. 16–18. (d) To satisfy strict scrutiny, government\naction “must advance ‘interests of the highest order’ and must be\nnarrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.” Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546. Montana’s interest in creating greater separation of\nchurch and State than the Federal Constitution requires “cannot\nqualify as compelling” in the face of the infringement of free\nexercise here. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. The\nDepartment’s argument that the no-aid provision actually promotes\nreligious freedom is unavailing because an infringement of First\nAmendment rights cannot be justified by a State’s alternative view\nthat the infringement advances religious liberty. The Department’s\nargument is especially unconvincing because the infringement here\nbroadly burdens not only religious schools but also the families\nwhose children attend them. The Department suggests that the no-aid\nprovision safeguards public education by ensuring that government\nsupport is not diverted to private schools, but that interest does\nnot justify a no-aid provision that requires only religious private\nschools to bear its weight. Pp. 18–20. (e) Because the Free Exercise Clause\nbarred the application of the no-aid provision here, the Montana\nSupreme Court had no authority to invalidate the program on the\nbasis of that provision. The Department argues that the\ninvalidation of the entire program prevented a free exercise\nviolation, but the Department overlooks the Montana Supreme Court’s\nthreshold error of federal law. Had the Montana Supreme Court\nrecognized that the application of the no-aid provision was barred\nby the Free Exercise Clause, the Court would have had no basis for\ninvalidating the program. The Court was obligated to disregard the\nno-aid provision and decide this case consistent with the Federal\nConstitution. Pp. 20–22. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603, reversed and\nremanded. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, in which Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ.,\njoined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Gorsuch,\nJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 18–1195 _________________ KENDRA ESPINOZA, et al., PETITIONERS v. MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, et al. on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmontana [June 30, 2020] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. The Montana Legislature established a program to\nprovide tuition assistance to parents who send their children to\nprivate schools. The program grants a tax credit to anyone who\ndonates to certain organizations that in turn award scholarships to\nselected students attending such schools. When petitioners sought\nto use the scholarships at a religious school, the Montana Supreme\nCourt struck down the program. The Court relied on the “no-aid”\nprovision of the State Constitution, which prohibits any aid to a\nschool controlled by a “church, sect, or denomination.” The\nquestion presented is whether the Free Exercise Clause of the\nUnited States Constitution barred that application of the no-aid\nprovision. I A In 2015, the Montana Legislature sought “to\nprovide parental and student choice in education” by enacting a\nscholarship program for students attending private schools. 2015\nMont. Laws p. 2168, §7. The program grants a tax credit of up to\n$150 to any taxpayer who donates to a participating “student\nscholarship organization.” Mont. Code Ann. §§15–30–3103(1),\n–3111(1) (2019). The scholarship organizations then use the\ndonations to award scholarships to children for tuition at a\nprivate school. §§15–30–3102(7)(a), –3103(1)(c).[ 1 ] So far only one scholarship organization, Big\nSky Scholarships, has participated in the program. Big Sky focuses\non providing scholarships to families who face financial hardship\nor have children with disabilities. Scholarship organizations like\nBig Sky must, among other requirements, maintain an application\nprocess for awarding the scholarships; use at least 90% of all\ndonations on scholarship awards; and comply with state reporting\nand monitoring requirements. §§15–30–3103(1), –3105(1),\n–3113(1). A family whose child is awarded a scholarship\nunder the program may use it at any “qualified education\nprovider”—that is, any private school that meets certain\naccreditation, testing, and safety requirements. See\n§15–30–3102(7). Virtually every private school in Montana\nqualifies. Upon receiving a scholarship, the family designates its\nschool of choice, and the scholarship organization sends the\nscholarship funds directly to the school. §15–30–3104(1). Neither\nthe scholarship organization nor its donors can restrict awards to\nparticular types of schools. See §§15–30–3103(1)(b), –3111(1). The Montana Legislature allotted $3 million\nannually to fund the tax credits, beginning in 2016.\n§15–30–3111(5)(a). If the annual allotment is exhausted, it\nincreases by 10% the following year. Ibid. The program is\nslated to expire in 2023. 2015 Mont. Laws p. 2186, §33. The Montana Legislature also directed that the\nprogram be administered in accordance with Article X, section 6, of\nthe Montana Constitution, which contains a “no-aid” provision\nbarring government aid to sectarian schools. See Mont. Code Ann.\n§15–30–3101. In full, that provision states: “ Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools . . . . The legislature, counties, cities, towns,\nschool districts, and public corporations shall not make any direct\nor indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or\nmonies, or any grant of lands or other property for any sectarian\npurpose or to aid any church, school, academy, seminary, college,\nuniversity, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled\nin whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.” Mont.\nConst., Art. X, §6(1). Shortly after the scholarship program was\ncreated, the Montana Department of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,”\nover the objection of the Montana Attorney General. That\nadministrative rule prohibited families from using scholarships at\nreligious schools. Mont. Admin. Rule §42.4.802(1)(a) (2015). It did\nso by changing the definition of “qualified education provider” to\nexclude any school “owned or controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, religious sect, or denomination.” Ibid. The\nDepartment explained that the Rule was needed to reconcile the\nscholarship program with the no-aid provision of the Montana\nConstitution. The Montana Attorney General disagreed. In a\nletter to the Department, he advised that the Montana Constitution\ndid not require excluding religious schools from the program, and\nif it did, it would “very likely” violate the United States\nConstitution by discriminating against the schools and their\nstudents. See Complaint in No. DV–15–1152A (Dist. Ct. Flathead\nCty.), Exh. 3, pp. 2, 5–6. The Attorney General is not representing\nthe Department in this case. B This suit was brought by three mothers whose\nchildren attend Stillwater Christian School in northwestern\nMontana. Stillwater is a private Christian school that meets the\nstatutory criteria for “qualified education providers.” It serves\nstudents in prekindergarten through 12th grade, and petitioners\nchose the school in large part because it “teaches the same\nChristian values that [they] teach at home.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n152; see id. , at 138, 167. The child of one petitioner has\nalready received scholarships from Big Sky, and the other\npetitioners’ children are eligible for scholarships and planned to\napply. While in effect, however, Rule 1 blocked petitioners from\nusing scholarship funds for tuition at Stillwater. To overcome that\nobstacle, petitioners sued the Department of Revenue in Montana\nstate court. Petitioners claimed that Rule 1 conflicted with the\nstatute that created the scholarship program and could not be\njustified on the ground that it was compelled by the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. Petitioners further alleged that\nthe Rule discriminated on the basis of their religious views and\nthe religious nature of the school they had chosen for their\nchildren. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, holding that it\nwas based on a mistake of law. The court explained that the Rule\nwas not required by the no-aid provision, because that provision\nprohibits only “appropriations” that aid religious schools, “not\ntax credits.” Id. , at 94. The injunctive relief freed Big Sky to award\nscholarships to students regardless of whether they attended a\nreligious or secular school. For the school year beginning in fall\n2017, Big Sky received 59 applications and ultimately awarded 44\nscholarships of $500 each. The next year, Big Sky received 90\napplications and awarded 54 scholarships of $500 each. Several\nfamilies, most with incomes of $30,000 or less, used the\nscholarships to send their children to Stillwater Christian. In December 2018, the Montana Supreme Court\nreversed the trial court. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603. The Court\nfirst addressed the scholarship program unmodified by Rule 1,\nholding that the program aided religious schools in violation of\nthe no-aid provision of the Montana Constitution. In the Court’s\nview, the no-aid provision “broadly and strictly prohibits aid to\nsectarian schools.” Id. , at 459, 435 P. 3d, at 609. The\nscholarship program provided such aid by using tax credits to\n“subsidize tuition payments” at private schools that are\n“religiously affiliated” or “controlled in whole or in part by\nchurches.” Id. , at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at 612–613. In\nthat way, the scholarship program flouted the State Constitution’s\n“guarantee to all Montanans that their government will not use\nstate funds to aid religious schools.” Id. , at 467, 435\nP. 3d, at 614. The Montana Supreme Court went on to hold that\nthe violation of the no-aid provision required invalidating the\nentire scholarship program. The Court explained that the program\nprovided “no mechanism” for preventing aid from flowing to\nreligious schools, and therefore the scholarship program could not\n“under any circumstance” be construed as consistent with the\nno-aid provision. Id. , at 466–468, 435 P. 3d, at\n613–614. As a result, the tax credit is no longer available to\nsupport scholarships at either religious or secular private\nschools. The Montana Supreme Court acknowledged that “an\noverly-broad” application of the no-aid provision “could implicate\nfree exercise concerns” and that “there may be a case” where\n“prohibiting the aid would violate the Free Exercise Clause.” Id. , at 468, 435 P. 3d, at 614. But, the Court\nconcluded, “this is not one of those cases.” Ibid. Finally, the Court agreed with petitioners that\nthe Department had exceeded its authority in promulgating\nRule 1. The Court explained that the statute creating the\nscholarship program had broadly defined qualifying schools to\ninclude all private schools, including religious ones, and the\nDepartment lacked authority to “transform” that definition with an\nadministrative rule. Id. , at 468–469, 435 P. 3d, at\n614–615. Several Justices wrote separately. All agreed\nthat Rule 1 was invalid, but they expressed differing views on\nwhether the scholarship program was consistent with the Montana and\nUnited States Constitutions. Justice Gustafson’s concurrence argued\nthat the program violated not only Montana’s no-aid provision but\nalso the Federal Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. Id. , at 475–479, 435 P. 3d, at 619–621. Justice\nSandefur echoed the majority’s conclusion that applying the no-aid\nprovision was consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, and he\ndismissed the “modern jurisprudence” of that Clause as\n“unnecessarily complicate[d]” due to “increasingly value-driven\nhairsplitting and overstretching.” Id. , at 482–484, 435\nP. 3d, at 623–624. Two Justices dissented. Justice Rice would have\nheld that the scholarship program was permissible under the no-aid\nprovision. He criticized the majority for invalidating the program\n“ sua sponte ,” contending that no party had challenged\nit under the State Constitution. Id. , at 495, 435\nP. 3d, at 631. Justice Baker also would have upheld the\nprogram. In her view, the no-aid provision did not bar the use of\nscholarships at religious schools, and free exercise concerns could\narise under the Federal Constitution if it did. Id. , at\n493–494, 435 P. 3d, at 630. We granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___\n(2019). II A The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment\nprovide that “Congress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof.” We have recognized a “ ‘play in the joints’ between what\nthe Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause\ncompels.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Locke v. Davey , 540\nU.S. 712 , 718 (2004)). Here, the parties do not dispute that\nthe scholarship program is permissible under the Establishment\nClause. Nor could they. We have repeatedly held that the\nEstablishment Clause is not offended when religious observers and\norganizations benefit from neutral government programs. See, e.g. , Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S.\n819 , 839 (1995). See also Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (noting the parties’ agreement\nthat the Establishment Clause was not violated by including\nchurches in a playground resurfacing program). Any Establishment\nClause objection to the scholarship program here is particularly\nunavailing because the government support makes its way to\nreligious schools only as a result of Montanans independently\nchoosing to spend their scholarships at such schools. See Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , 536 U.S.\n639 , 649–653 (2002). The Montana Supreme Court, however, held\nas a matter of state law that even such indirect government support\nqualified as “aid” prohibited under the Montana Constitution. The question for this Court is whether the Free\nExercise Clause precluded the Montana Supreme Court from applying\nMontana’s no-aid provision to bar religious schools from the\nscholarship program. For purposes of answering that question, we\naccept the Montana Supreme Court’s interpretation of state\nlaw—including its determination that the scholarship program\nprovided impermissible “aid” within the meaning of the Montana\nConstitution—and we assess whether excluding religious schools and\naffected families from that program was consistent with the Federal\nConstitution.[ 2 ] The Free Exercise Clause, which applies to the\nStates under the Fourteenth Amendment, “protects religious\nobservers against unequal treatment” and against “laws that impose\nspecial disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 9)\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310\nU.S. 296 , 303 (1940). Those “basic principle[s ]” have\nlong guided this Court. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 6–9). See, e.g. , Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U.S.\n1 , 16 (1947) (a State “cannot exclude individual Catholics,\nLutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers,\nPresbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of\ntheir faith, or lack of it , from receiving the benefits of\npublic welfare legislation”); Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , 449 (1988) (the Free Exercise Clause protects against laws\nthat “penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal\nshare of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other\ncitizens”). Most recently, Trinity Lutheran distilled\nthese and other decisions to the same effect into the\n“unremarkable” conclusion that disqualifying otherwise eligible\nrecipients from a public benefit “solely because of their religious\ncharacter” imposes “a penalty on the free exercise of religion that\ntriggers the most exacting scrutiny.” 582 U. S., at ___–___\n(slip op., at 9–10). In Trinity Lutheran , Missouri provided\ngrants to help nonprofit organizations pay for playground\nresurfacing, but a state policy disqualified any organization\n“owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 2). Because of that policy, an\notherwise eligible church-owned preschool was denied a grant to\nresurface its playground. Missouri’s policy discriminated against\nthe Church “simply because of what it is—a church,” and so the\npolicy was subject to the “strictest scrutiny,” which it failed. Id. , at ___–___ (slip op., at 11–15). We acknowledged that\nthe State had not “criminalized” the way in which the Church\nworshipped or “told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a\ncertain view of the Gospel.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 11).\nBut the State’s discriminatory policy was “odious to our\nConstitution all the same.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at\n15). Here too Montana’s no-aid provision bars\nreligious schools from public benefits solely because of the\nreligious character of the schools. The provision also bars parents\nwho wish to send their children to a religious school from those\nsame benefits, again solely because of the religious character of\nthe school. This is apparent from the plain text. The provision\nbars aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination.” Mont. Const., Art. X, §6(1).\nThe provision’s title—“Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools”—confirms that the provision singles out schools based on\ntheir religious character. Ibid. And the Montana Supreme\nCourt explained that the provision forbids aid to any school that\nis “sectarian,” “religiously affiliated,” or “controlled in whole\nor in part by churches.” 393 Mont., at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at\n612–613. The provision plainly excludes schools from government aid\nsolely because of religious status. See Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–10). The Department counters that Trinity\nLutheran does not govern here because the no-aid provision\napplies not because of the religious character of the recipients,\nbut because of how the funds would be used—for “religious\neducation.” Brief for Respondents 38. In Trinity Lutheran , a\nmajority of the Court concluded that the Missouri policy violated\nthe Free Exercise Clause because it discriminated on the basis of\nreligious status. A plurality declined to address discrimination\nwith respect to “religious uses of funding or other forms of\ndiscrimination.” 582 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 14, n.\n3). The plurality saw no need to consider such concerns because\nMissouri had expressly discriminated “based on religious identity,” ibid. , which was enough to invalidate the state policy\nwithout addressing how government funds were used. This case also turns expressly on religious\nstatus and not religious use. The Montana Supreme Court applied the\nno-aid provision solely by reference to religious status. The Court\nrepeatedly explained that the no-aid provision bars aid to “schools\ncontrolled in whole or in part by churches,” “sectarian schools,”\nand “religiously-affiliated schools.” 393 Mont., at 463–467, 435\nP. 3d, at 611–613. Applying this provision to the scholarship\nprogram, the Montana Supreme Court noted that most of the private\nschools that would benefit from the program were “religiously\naffiliated” and “controlled by churches,” and the Court ultimately\nconcluded that the scholarship program ran afoul of the Montana\nConstitution by aiding “schools controlled by churches.” Id. , at 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 613–614. The Montana\nConstitution discriminates based on religious status just like the\nMissouri policy in Trinity Lutheran , which excluded\norganizations “owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other\nreligious entity.” 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). The Department points to some language in the\ndecision below indicating that the no-aid provision has the goal or\neffect of ensuring that government aid does not end up being used\nfor “sectarian education” or “religious education.” 393 Mont., at\n460, 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 609, 613–614. The Department also\ncontrasts what it characterizes as the “completely non-religious”\nbenefit of playground resurfacing in Trinity Lutheran with\nthe unrestricted tuition aid at issue here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.\nGeneral school aid, the Department stresses, could be used for\nreligious ends by some recipients, particularly schools that\nbelieve faith should “ permeate [ ]” everything they do.\nBrief for Respondents 39 (quoting State ex rel. Chambers v. School Dist. No. 10 , 155 Mont. 422, 438, 472 P.2d 1013 , 1021 (1970)). See also post , at 8, 13\n(Breyer, J., dissenting). Regardless, those considerations were not the\nMontana Supreme Court’s basis for applying the no-aid provision to\nexclude religious schools; that hinged solely on religious status.\nStatus-based discrimination remains status based even if one of its\ngoals or effects is preventing religious organizations from putting\naid to religious uses. Undeterred by Trinity Lutheran , the\nMontana Supreme Court applied the no-aid provision to hold that\nreligious schools could not benefit from the scholarship program.\n393 Mont., at 464–468, 435 P. 3d, at 612–614. So applied, the\nprovision “impose[s] special disabilities on the basis of religious\nstatus” and “condition[s] the availability of benefits upon a\nrecipient’s willingness to surrender [its] religiously impelled\nstatus.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 9–10) (quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508\nU.S. 520 , 533 (1993), and McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U.S.\n618 , 626 (1978) (plurality opinion) (alterations omitted)). To\nbe eligible for government aid under the Montana Constitution, a\nschool must divorce itself from any religious control or\naffiliation. Placing such a condition on benefits or privileges\n“inevitably deters or discourages the exercise of First Amendment\nrights.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S.\n398 , 405 (1963) (alterations omitted)). The Free Exercise\nClause protects against even “indirect coercion,” and a State\n“punishe[s] the free exercise of religion” by disqualifying the\nreligious from government aid as Montana did here. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Such status-based\ndiscrimination is subject to “the strictest scrutiny.” Id. ,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). None of this is meant to suggest that we agree\nwith the Department, Brief for Respondents 36–40, that some lesser\ndegree of scrutiny applies to discrimination against religious uses\nof government aid. See Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546\n(striking down law designed to ban religious practice involving\nalleged animal cruelty, explaining that a law “target[ing]\nreligious conduct for distinctive treatment or advanc[ing]\nlegitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a\nreligious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare\ncases”). Some Members of the Court, moreover, have questioned\nwhether there is a meaningful distinction between discrimination\nbased on use or conduct and that based on status. See Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2)\n(Gorsuch, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in part) (citing, e.g. , Lukumi , 508 U.S.\n520 , and Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment\nSecurity Div. , 450 U.S.\n707 (1981)). We acknowledge the point but need not examine it\nhere. It is enough in this case to conclude that strict scrutiny\napplies under Trinity Lutheran because Montana’s no-aid\nprovision discriminates based on religious status. B Seeking to avoid Trinity Lutheran , the\nDepartment contends that this case is instead governed by Locke v. Davey , 540 U.S.\n712 (2004). See also post , at 5 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting); post , at 9 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Locke also involved a scholarship program. The State of\nWashington provided scholarships paid out of the State’s general\nfund to help students pursuing postsecondary education. The\nscholarships could be used at accredited religious and nonreligious\nschools alike, but Washington prohibited students from using the\nscholarships to pursue devotional theology degrees, which prepared\nstudents for a calling as clergy. This prohibition prevented Davey\nfrom using his scholarship to obtain a degree that would have\nenabled him to become a pastor. We held that Washington had not\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. Locke differs from this case in two\ncritical ways. First, Locke explained that Washington had\n“merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction”: the\n“essentially religious endeavor” of training a minister “to lead a\ncongregation.” Id. , at 721. Thus, Davey “was denied a\nscholarship because of what he proposed to do —use the funds\nto prepare for the ministry.” Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Apart from that narrow\nrestriction, Washington’s program allowed scholarships to be used\nat “pervasively religious schools” that incorporated religious\ninstruction throughout their classes. Locke , 540 U. S.,\nat 724–725. By contrast, Montana’s Constitution does not zero in on\nany particular “essentially religious” course of instruction at a\nreligious school. Rather, as we have explained, the no-aid\nprovision bars all aid to a religious school “simply because of\nwhat it is,” putting the school to a choice between being religious\nor receiving government benefits. Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). At the same time, the\nprovision puts families to a choice between sending their children\nto a religious school or receiving such benefits. Second, Locke invoked a “historic and\nsubstantial” state interest in not funding the training of clergy,\n540 U. S., at 725, explaining that “opposition to\n. . . funding ‘to support church leaders’ lay at the\nhistoric core of the Religion Clauses,” Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting Locke , 540\nU. S., at 722). As evidence of that tradition, the Court in Locke emphasized that the propriety of state-supported\nclergy was a central subject of founding-era debates, and that most\nstate constitutions from that era prohibited the expenditure of tax\ndollars to support the clergy. See id. , at 722–723. But no comparable “historic and substantial”\ntradition supports Montana’s decision to disqualify religious\nschools from government aid. In the founding era and the early 19th\ncentury, governments provided financial support to private schools,\nincluding denominational ones. “Far from prohibiting such support,\nthe early state constitutions and statutes actively encouraged this\npolicy.” L. Jorgenson, The State and the Non-Public School,\n1825–1925, p. 4 (1987); e.g., R. Gabel, Public Funds for\nChurch and Private Schools 210, 217–218, 221, 241–243 (1937); C.\nKaestle, Pillars of the Republic: Common Schools and American\nSociety, 1760–1860, pp. 166–167 (1983). Local governments provided\ngrants to private schools, including religious ones, for the\neducation of the poor. M. McConnell, et al., Religion and the\nConstitution 318–319 (4th ed. 2016). Even States with bans on\ngovernment-supported clergy, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\nGeorgia, provided various forms of aid to religious schools.\n See Kaestle, supra , at 166–167; Gabel, supra ,\nat 215–218, 241–245, 372–374; cf. Locke , 540 U. S., at\n723. Early federal aid (often land grants) went to religious\nschools. McConnell, supra , at 319. Congress provided support\nto denominational schools in the District of Columbia until 1848, ibid. , and Congress paid churches to run schools for\nAmerican Indians through the end of the 19th century, see Quick\nBear v. Leupp , 210 U.S.\n50 , 78 (1908); Gabel, supra , at 521–523. After the Civil\nWar, Congress spent large sums on education for emancipated\nfreedmen, often by supporting denominational schools in the South\nthrough the Freedmen’s Bureau. McConnell, supra , at\n323.[ 3 ] The Department argues that a tradition against state support for religious schools arose in the\nsecond half of the 19th century, as more than 30 States—including\nMontana—adopted no-aid provisions. See Brief for Respondents 40–42\nand App. D. Such a development, of course, cannot by itself\nestablish an early American tradition. Justice Sotomayor questions\nour reliance on aid provided during the same era by the Freedmen’s\nBureau, post , at 10 (dissenting opinion), but we see no\ninconsistency in recognizing that such evidence may reinforce an\nearly practice but cannot create one. In addition, many of the\nno-aid provisions belong to a more checkered tradition shared with\nthe Blaine Amendment of the 1870s. That proposal—which Congress\nnearly passed—would have added to the Federal Constitution a\nprovision similar to the state no-aid provisions, prohibiting\n",

MONTANA\nDEPARTMENT OF REVENUE et al. certiorari to the supreme court of montana No. 18–1195. Argued January 22, 2020—Decided\nJune 30, 2020 The Montana Legislature established a program\nthat grants tax credits to those who donate to organizations that\naward scholarships for private school tuition. To reconcile the\nprogram with a provision of the Montana Constitution that bars\ngovernment aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination,” Art. X, §6(1), the Montana\nDepartment of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,” which prohibited\nfamilies from using the scholarships at religious schools. Three\nmothers who were blocked by Rule 1 from using scholarship funds for\ntheir children’s tuition at Stillwater Christian School sued the\nDepartment in state court, alleging that the Rule discriminated on\nthe basis of their religious views and the religious nature of the\nschool they had chosen. The trial court enjoined Rule 1. Reversing,\nthe Montana Supreme Court held that the program, unmodified by Rule\n1, aided religious schools in violation of the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. The Court further held that the\nviolation required invalidating the entire program. Held : The application of the\nno-aid provision discriminated against religious schools and the\nfamilies whose children attend or hope to attend them in violation\nof the Free Exercise Clause of the Federal Constitution.\nPp. 6–22. (a) The Free Exercise Clause “protects\nreligious observers against unequal treatment” and against “laws\nthat impose special disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer ,\n582 U. S. ___, ___. In Trinity Lutheran , this Court\nheld that disqualifying otherwise eligible recipients from a public\nbenefit “solely because of their religious character” imposes “a\npenalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most\nexacting scrutiny.” Id. , at ___. Here, the application of\nMontana’s no-aid provision excludes religious schools from public\nbenefits solely because of religious status. As a result, strict\nscrutiny applies. Pp. 6–12. (b) Contrary to the Department’s\ncontention, this case is not governed by Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S.\n712 . The plaintiff in Locke was denied a scholarship\n“because of what he proposed to do —use the funds to prepare\nfor the ministry,” an essentially religious endeavor. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. By contrast, Montana’s no-aid\nprovision does not zero in on any essentially religious course of\ninstruction but rather bars aid to a religious school “simply\nbecause of what it is”—a religious school. Id. , at ___. Locke also invoked a “historic and substantial” state\ninterest in not funding the training of clergy, 540 U. S., at\n725, but no comparable tradition supports Montana’s decision to\ndisqualify religious schools from government aid.\nPp. 12–16. (c) The proposed alternative approach\ninvolving a flexible case-by-case analysis is inconsistent with Trinity Lutheran . The protections of the Free Exercise\nClause do not depend on a varying case-by-case analysis regarding\nwhether discrimination against religious adherents would serve\nill-defined interests. Pp. 16–18. (d) To satisfy strict scrutiny, government\naction “must advance ‘interests of the highest order’ and must be\nnarrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.” Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546. Montana’s interest in creating greater separation of\nchurch and State than the Federal Constitution requires “cannot\nqualify as compelling” in the face of the infringement of free\nexercise here. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. The\nDepartment’s argument that the no-aid provision actually promotes\nreligious freedom is unavailing because an infringement of First\nAmendment rights cannot be justified by a State’s alternative view\nthat the infringement advances religious liberty. The Department’s\nargument is especially unconvincing because the infringement here\nbroadly burdens not only religious schools but also the families\nwhose children attend them. The Department suggests that the no-aid\nprovision safeguards public education by ensuring that government\nsupport is not diverted to private schools, but that interest does\nnot justify a no-aid provision that requires only religious private\nschools to bear its weight. Pp. 18–20. (e) Because the Free Exercise Clause\nbarred the application of the no-aid provision here, the Montana\nSupreme Court had no authority to invalidate the program on the\nbasis of that provision. The Department argues that the\ninvalidation of the entire program prevented a free exercise\nviolation, but the Department overlooks the Montana Supreme Court’s\nthreshold error of federal law. Had the Montana Supreme Court\nrecognized that the application of the no-aid provision was barred\nby the Free Exercise Clause, the Court would have had no basis for\ninvalidating the program. The Court was obligated to disregard the\nno-aid provision and decide this case consistent with the Federal\nConstitution. Pp. 20–22. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603, reversed and\nremanded. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, in which Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ.,\njoined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Gorsuch,\nJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 18–1195 _________________ KENDRA ESPINOZA, et al., PETITIONERS v. MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, et al. on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmontana [June 30, 2020] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. The Montana Legislature established a program to\nprovide tuition assistance to parents who send their children to\nprivate schools. The program grants a tax credit to anyone who\ndonates to certain organizations that in turn award scholarships to\nselected students attending such schools. When petitioners sought\nto use the scholarships at a religious school, the Montana Supreme\nCourt struck down the program. The Court relied on the “no-aid”\nprovision of the State Constitution, which prohibits any aid to a\nschool controlled by a “church, sect, or denomination.” The\nquestion presented is whether the Free Exercise Clause of the\nUnited States Constitution barred that application of the no-aid\nprovision. I A In 2015, the Montana Legislature sought “to\nprovide parental and student choice in education” by enacting a\nscholarship program for students attending private schools. 2015\nMont. Laws p. 2168, §7. The program grants a tax credit of up to\n$150 to any taxpayer who donates to a participating “student\nscholarship organization.” Mont. Code Ann. §§15–30–3103(1),\n–3111(1) (2019). The scholarship organizations then use the\ndonations to award scholarships to children for tuition at a\nprivate school. §§15–30–3102(7)(a), –3103(1)(c).[ 1 ] So far only one scholarship organization, Big\nSky Scholarships, has participated in the program. Big Sky focuses\non providing scholarships to families who face financial hardship\nor have children with disabilities. Scholarship organizations like\nBig Sky must, among other requirements, maintain an application\nprocess for awarding the scholarships; use at least 90% of all\ndonations on scholarship awards; and comply with state reporting\nand monitoring requirements. §§15–30–3103(1), –3105(1),\n–3113(1). A family whose child is awarded a scholarship\nunder the program may use it at any “qualified education\nprovider”—that is, any private school that meets certain\naccreditation, testing, and safety requirements. See\n§15–30–3102(7). Virtually every private school in Montana\nqualifies. Upon receiving a scholarship, the family designates its\nschool of choice, and the scholarship organization sends the\nscholarship funds directly to the school. §15–30–3104(1). Neither\nthe scholarship organization nor its donors can restrict awards to\nparticular types of schools. See §§15–30–3103(1)(b), –3111(1). The Montana Legislature allotted $3 million\nannually to fund the tax credits, beginning in 2016.\n§15–30–3111(5)(a). If the annual allotment is exhausted, it\nincreases by 10% the following year. Ibid. The program is\nslated to expire in 2023. 2015 Mont. Laws p. 2186, §33. The Montana Legislature also directed that the\nprogram be administered in accordance with Article X, section 6, of\nthe Montana Constitution, which contains a “no-aid” provision\nbarring government aid to sectarian schools. See Mont. Code Ann.\n§15–30–3101. In full, that provision states: “ Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools . . . . The legislature, counties, cities, towns,\nschool districts, and public corporations shall not make any direct\nor indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or\nmonies, or any grant of lands or other property for any sectarian\npurpose or to aid any church, school, academy, seminary, college,\nuniversity, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled\nin whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.” Mont.\nConst., Art. X, §6(1). Shortly after the scholarship program was\ncreated, the Montana Department of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,”\nover the objection of the Montana Attorney General. That\nadministrative rule prohibited families from using scholarships at\nreligious schools. Mont. Admin. Rule §42.4.802(1)(a) (2015). It did\nso by changing the definition of “qualified education provider” to\nexclude any school “owned or controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, religious sect, or denomination.” Ibid. The\nDepartment explained that the Rule was needed to reconcile the\nscholarship program with the no-aid provision of the Montana\nConstitution. The Montana Attorney General disagreed. In a\nletter to the Department, he advised that the Montana Constitution\ndid not require excluding religious schools from the program, and\nif it did, it would “very likely” violate the United States\nConstitution by discriminating against the schools and their\nstudents. See Complaint in No. DV–15–1152A (Dist. Ct. Flathead\nCty.), Exh. 3, pp. 2, 5–6. The Attorney General is not representing\nthe Department in this case. B This suit was brought by three mothers whose\nchildren attend Stillwater Christian School in northwestern\nMontana. Stillwater is a private Christian school that meets the\nstatutory criteria for “qualified education providers.” It serves\nstudents in prekindergarten through 12th grade, and petitioners\nchose the school in large part because it “teaches the same\nChristian values that [they] teach at home.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n152; see id. , at 138, 167. The child of one petitioner has\nalready received scholarships from Big Sky, and the other\npetitioners’ children are eligible for scholarships and planned to\napply. While in effect, however, Rule 1 blocked petitioners from\nusing scholarship funds for tuition at Stillwater. To overcome that\nobstacle, petitioners sued the Department of Revenue in Montana\nstate court. Petitioners claimed that Rule 1 conflicted with the\nstatute that created the scholarship program and could not be\njustified on the ground that it was compelled by the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. Petitioners further alleged that\nthe Rule discriminated on the basis of their religious views and\nthe religious nature of the school they had chosen for their\nchildren. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, holding that it\nwas based on a mistake of law. The court explained that the Rule\nwas not required by the no-aid provision, because that provision\nprohibits only “appropriations” that aid religious schools, “not\ntax credits.” Id. , at 94. The injunctive relief freed Big Sky to award\nscholarships to students regardless of whether they attended a\nreligious or secular school. For the school year beginning in fall\n2017, Big Sky received 59 applications and ultimately awarded 44\nscholarships of $500 each. The next year, Big Sky received 90\napplications and awarded 54 scholarships of $500 each. Several\nfamilies, most with incomes of $30,000 or less, used the\nscholarships to send their children to Stillwater Christian. In December 2018, the Montana Supreme Court\nreversed the trial court. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603. The Court\nfirst addressed the scholarship program unmodified by Rule 1,\nholding that the program aided religious schools in violation of\nthe no-aid provision of the Montana Constitution. In the Court’s\nview, the no-aid provision “broadly and strictly prohibits aid to\nsectarian schools.” Id. , at 459, 435 P. 3d, at 609. The\nscholarship program provided such aid by using tax credits to\n“subsidize tuition payments” at private schools that are\n“religiously affiliated” or “controlled in whole or in part by\nchurches.” Id. , at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at 612–613. In\nthat way, the scholarship program flouted the State Constitution’s\n“guarantee to all Montanans that their government will not use\nstate funds to aid religious schools.” Id. , at 467, 435\nP. 3d, at 614. The Montana Supreme Court went on to hold that\nthe violation of the no-aid provision required invalidating the\nentire scholarship program. The Court explained that the program\nprovided “no mechanism” for preventing aid from flowing to\nreligious schools, and therefore the scholarship program could not\n“under any circumstance” be construed as consistent with the\nno-aid provision. Id. , at 466–468, 435 P. 3d, at\n613–614. As a result, the tax credit is no longer available to\nsupport scholarships at either religious or secular private\nschools. The Montana Supreme Court acknowledged that “an\noverly-broad” application of the no-aid provision “could implicate\nfree exercise concerns” and that “there may be a case” where\n“prohibiting the aid would violate the Free Exercise Clause.” Id. , at 468, 435 P. 3d, at 614. But, the Court\nconcluded, “this is not one of those cases.” Ibid. Finally, the Court agreed with petitioners that\nthe Department had exceeded its authority in promulgating\nRule 1. The Court explained that the statute creating the\nscholarship program had broadly defined qualifying schools to\ninclude all private schools, including religious ones, and the\nDepartment lacked authority to “transform” that definition with an\nadministrative rule. Id. , at 468–469, 435 P. 3d, at\n614–615. Several Justices wrote separately. All agreed\nthat Rule 1 was invalid, but they expressed differing views on\nwhether the scholarship program was consistent with the Montana and\nUnited States Constitutions. Justice Gustafson’s concurrence argued\nthat the program violated not only Montana’s no-aid provision but\nalso the Federal Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. Id. , at 475–479, 435 P. 3d, at 619–621. Justice\nSandefur echoed the majority’s conclusion that applying the no-aid\nprovision was consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, and he\ndismissed the “modern jurisprudence” of that Clause as\n“unnecessarily complicate[d]” due to “increasingly value-driven\nhairsplitting and overstretching.” Id. , at 482–484, 435\nP. 3d, at 623–624. Two Justices dissented. Justice Rice would have\nheld that the scholarship program was permissible under the no-aid\nprovision. He criticized the majority for invalidating the program\n“ sua sponte ,” contending that no party had challenged\nit under the State Constitution. Id. , at 495, 435\nP. 3d, at 631. Justice Baker also would have upheld the\nprogram. In her view, the no-aid provision did not bar the use of\nscholarships at religious schools, and free exercise concerns could\narise under the Federal Constitution if it did. Id. , at\n493–494, 435 P. 3d, at 630. We granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___\n(2019). II A The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment\nprovide that “Congress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof.” We have recognized a “ ‘play in the joints’ between what\nthe Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause\ncompels.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Locke v. Davey , 540\nU.S. 712 , 718 (2004)). Here, the parties do not dispute that\nthe scholarship program is permissible under the Establishment\nClause. Nor could they. We have repeatedly held that the\nEstablishment Clause is not offended when religious observers and\norganizations benefit from neutral government programs. See, e.g. , Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S.\n819 , 839 (1995). See also Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (noting the parties’ agreement\nthat the Establishment Clause was not violated by including\nchurches in a playground resurfacing program). Any Establishment\nClause objection to the scholarship program here is particularly\nunavailing because the government support makes its way to\nreligious schools only as a result of Montanans independently\nchoosing to spend their scholarships at such schools. See Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , 536 U.S.\n639 , 649–653 (2002). The Montana Supreme Court, however, held\nas a matter of state law that even such indirect government support\nqualified as “aid” prohibited under the Montana Constitution. The question for this Court is whether the Free\nExercise Clause precluded the Montana Supreme Court from applying\nMontana’s no-aid provision to bar religious schools from the\nscholarship program. For purposes of answering that question, we\naccept the Montana Supreme Court’s interpretation of state\nlaw—including its determination that the scholarship program\nprovided impermissible “aid” within the meaning of the Montana\nConstitution—and we assess whether excluding religious schools and\naffected families from that program was consistent with the Federal\nConstitution.[ 2 ] The Free Exercise Clause, which applies to the\nStates under the Fourteenth Amendment, “protects religious\nobservers against unequal treatment” and against “laws that impose\nspecial disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 9)\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310\nU.S. 296 , 303 (1940). Those “basic principle[s ]” have\nlong guided this Court. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 6–9). See, e.g. , Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U.S.\n1 , 16 (1947) (a State “cannot exclude individual Catholics,\nLutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers,\nPresbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of\ntheir faith, or lack of it , from receiving the benefits of\npublic welfare legislation”); Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , 449 (1988) (the Free Exercise Clause protects against laws\nthat “penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal\nshare of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other\ncitizens”). Most recently, Trinity Lutheran distilled\nthese and other decisions to the same effect into the\n“unremarkable” conclusion that disqualifying otherwise eligible\nrecipients from a public benefit “solely because of their religious\ncharacter” imposes “a penalty on the free exercise of religion that\ntriggers the most exacting scrutiny.” 582 U. S., at ___–___\n(slip op., at 9–10). In Trinity Lutheran , Missouri provided\ngrants to help nonprofit organizations pay for playground\nresurfacing, but a state policy disqualified any organization\n“owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 2). Because of that policy, an\notherwise eligible church-owned preschool was denied a grant to\nresurface its playground. Missouri’s policy discriminated against\nthe Church “simply because of what it is—a church,” and so the\npolicy was subject to the “strictest scrutiny,” which it failed. Id. , at ___–___ (slip op., at 11–15). We acknowledged that\nthe State had not “criminalized” the way in which the Church\nworshipped or “told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a\ncertain view of the Gospel.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 11).\nBut the State’s discriminatory policy was “odious to our\nConstitution all the same.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at\n15). Here too Montana’s no-aid provision bars\nreligious schools from public benefits solely because of the\nreligious character of the schools. The provision also bars parents\nwho wish to send their children to a religious school from those\nsame benefits, again solely because of the religious character of\nthe school. This is apparent from the plain text. The provision\nbars aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination.” Mont. Const., Art. X, §6(1).\nThe provision’s title—“Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools”—confirms that the provision singles out schools based on\ntheir religious character. Ibid. And the Montana Supreme\nCourt explained that the provision forbids aid to any school that\nis “sectarian,” “religiously affiliated,” or “controlled in whole\nor in part by churches.” 393 Mont., at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at\n612–613. The provision plainly excludes schools from government aid\nsolely because of religious status. See Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–10). The Department counters that Trinity\nLutheran does not govern here because the no-aid provision\napplies not because of the religious character of the recipients,\nbut because of how the funds would be used—for “religious\neducation.” Brief for Respondents 38. In Trinity Lutheran , a\nmajority of the Court concluded that the Missouri policy violated\nthe Free Exercise Clause because it discriminated on the basis of\nreligious status. A plurality declined to address discrimination\nwith respect to “religious uses of funding or other forms of\ndiscrimination.” 582 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 14, n.\n3). The plurality saw no need to consider such concerns because\nMissouri had expressly discriminated “based on religious identity,” ibid. , which was enough to invalidate the state policy\nwithout addressing how government funds were used. This case also turns expressly on religious\nstatus and not religious use. The Montana Supreme Court applied the\nno-aid provision solely by reference to religious status. The Court\nrepeatedly explained that the no-aid provision bars aid to “schools\ncontrolled in whole or in part by churches,” “sectarian schools,”\nand “religiously-affiliated schools.” 393 Mont., at 463–467, 435\nP. 3d, at 611–613. Applying this provision to the scholarship\nprogram, the Montana Supreme Court noted that most of the private\nschools that would benefit from the program were “religiously\naffiliated” and “controlled by churches,” and the Court ultimately\nconcluded that the scholarship program ran afoul of the Montana\nConstitution by aiding “schools controlled by churches.” Id. , at 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 613–614. The Montana\nConstitution discriminates based on religious status just like the\nMissouri policy in Trinity Lutheran , which excluded\norganizations “owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other\nreligious entity.” 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). The Department points to some language in the\ndecision below indicating that the no-aid provision has the goal or\neffect of ensuring that government aid does not end up being used\nfor “sectarian education” or “religious education.” 393 Mont., at\n460, 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 609, 613–614. The Department also\ncontrasts what it characterizes as the “completely non-religious”\nbenefit of playground resurfacing in Trinity Lutheran with\nthe unrestricted tuition aid at issue here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.\nGeneral school aid, the Department stresses, could be used for\nreligious ends by some recipients, particularly schools that\nbelieve faith should “ permeate [ ]” everything they do.\nBrief for Respondents 39 (quoting State ex rel. Chambers v. School Dist. No. 10 , 155 Mont. 422, 438, 472 P.2d 1013 , 1021 (1970)). See also post , at 8, 13\n(Breyer, J., dissenting). Regardless, those considerations were not the\nMontana Supreme Court’s basis for applying the no-aid provision to\nexclude religious schools; that hinged solely on religious status.\nStatus-based discrimination remains status based even if one of its\ngoals or effects is preventing religious organizations from putting\naid to religious uses. Undeterred by Trinity Lutheran , the\nMontana Supreme Court applied the no-aid provision to hold that\nreligious schools could not benefit from the scholarship program.\n393 Mont., at 464–468, 435 P. 3d, at 612–614. So applied, the\nprovision “impose[s] special disabilities on the basis of religious\nstatus” and “condition[s] the availability of benefits upon a\nrecipient’s willingness to surrender [its] religiously impelled\nstatus.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 9–10) (quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508\nU.S. 520 , 533 (1993), and McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U.S.\n618 , 626 (1978) (plurality opinion) (alterations omitted)). To\nbe eligible for government aid under the Montana Constitution, a\nschool must divorce itself from any religious control or\naffiliation. Placing such a condition on benefits or privileges\n“inevitably deters or discourages the exercise of First Amendment\nrights.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S.\n398 , 405 (1963) (alterations omitted)). The Free Exercise\nClause protects against even “indirect coercion,” and a State\n“punishe[s] the free exercise of religion” by disqualifying the\nreligious from government aid as Montana did here. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Such status-based\ndiscrimination is subject to “the strictest scrutiny.” Id. ,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). None of this is meant to suggest that we agree\nwith the Department, Brief for Respondents 36–40, that some lesser\ndegree of scrutiny applies to discrimination against religious uses\nof government aid. See Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546\n(striking down law designed to ban religious practice involving\nalleged animal cruelty, explaining that a law “target[ing]\nreligious conduct for distinctive treatment or advanc[ing]\nlegitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a\nreligious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare\ncases”). Some Members of the Court, moreover, have questioned\nwhether there is a meaningful distinction between discrimination\nbased on use or conduct and that based on status. See Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2)\n(Gorsuch, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in part) (citing, e.g. , Lukumi , 508 U.S.\n520 , and Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment\nSecurity Div. , 450 U.S.\n707 (1981)). We acknowledge the point but need not examine it\nhere. It is enough in this case to conclude that strict scrutiny\napplies under Trinity Lutheran because Montana’s no-aid\nprovision discriminates based on religious status. B Seeking to avoid Trinity Lutheran , the\nDepartment contends that this case is instead governed by Locke v. Davey , 540 U.S.\n712 (2004). See also post , at 5 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting); post , at 9 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Locke also involved a scholarship program. The State of\nWashington provided scholarships paid out of the State’s general\nfund to help students pursuing postsecondary education. The\nscholarships could be used at accredited religious and nonreligious\nschools alike, but Washington prohibited students from using the\nscholarships to pursue devotional theology degrees, which prepared\nstudents for a calling as clergy. This prohibition prevented Davey\nfrom using his scholarship to obtain a degree that would have\nenabled him to become a pastor. We held that Washington had not\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. Locke differs from this case in two\ncritical ways. First, Locke explained that Washington had\n“merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction”: the\n“essentially religious endeavor” of training a minister “to lead a\ncongregation.” Id. , at 721. Thus, Davey “was denied a\nscholarship because of what he proposed to do —use the funds\nto prepare for the ministry.” Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Apart from that narrow\nrestriction, Washington’s program allowed scholarships to be used\nat “pervasively religious schools” that incorporated religious\ninstruction throughout their classes. Locke , 540 U. S.,\nat 724–725. By contrast, Montana’s Constitution does not zero in on\nany particular “essentially religious” course of instruction at a\nreligious school. Rather, as we have explained, the no-aid\nprovision bars all aid to a religious school “simply because of\nwhat it is,” putting the school to a choice between being religious\nor receiving government benefits. Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). At the same time, the\nprovision puts families to a choice between sending their children\nto a religious school or receiving such benefits. Second, Locke invoked a “historic and\nsubstantial” state interest in not funding the training of clergy,\n540 U. S., at 725, explaining that “opposition to\n. . . funding ‘to support church leaders’ lay at the\nhistoric core of the Religion Clauses,” Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting Locke , 540\nU. S., at 722). As evidence of that tradition, the Court in Locke emphasized that the propriety of state-supported\nclergy was a central subject of founding-era debates, and that most\nstate constitutions from that era prohibited the expenditure of tax\ndollars to support the clergy. See id. , at 722–723. But no comparable “historic and substantial”\ntradition supports Montana’s decision to disqualify religious\nschools from government aid. In the founding era and the early 19th\ncentury, governments provided financial support to private schools,\nincluding denominational ones. “Far from prohibiting such support,\nthe early state constitutions and statutes actively encouraged this\npolicy.” L. Jorgenson, The State and the Non-Public School,\n1825–1925, p. 4 (1987); e.g., R. Gabel, Public Funds for\nChurch and Private Schools 210, 217–218, 221, 241–243 (1937); C.\nKaestle, Pillars of the Republic: Common Schools and American\nSociety, 1760–1860, pp. 166–167 (1983). Local governments provided\ngrants to private schools, including religious ones, for the\neducation of the poor. M. McConnell, et al., Religion and the\nConstitution 318–319 (4th ed. 2016). Even States with bans on\ngovernment-supported clergy, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\nGeorgia, provided various forms of aid to religious schools.\n See Kaestle, supra , at 166–167; Gabel, supra ,\nat 215–218, 241–245, 372–374; cf. Locke , 540 U. S., at\n723. Early federal aid (often land grants) went to religious\nschools. McConnell, supra , at 319. Congress provided support\nto denominational schools in the District of Columbia until 1848, ibid. , and Congress paid churches to run schools for\nAmerican Indians through the end of the 19th century, see Quick\nBear v. Leupp , 210 U.S.\n50 , 78 (1908); Gabel, supra , at 521–523. After the Civil\nWar, Congress spent large sums on education for emancipated\nfreedmen, often by supporting denominational schools in the South\nthrough the Freedmen’s Bureau. McConnell, supra , at\n323.[ 3 ] The Department argues that a tradition against state support for religious schools arose in the\nsecond half of the 19th century, as more than 30 States—including\nMontana—adopted no-aid provisions. See Brief for Respondents 40–42\nand App. D. Such a development, of course, cannot by itself\nestablish an early American tradition. Justice Sotomayor questions\nour reliance on aid provided during the same era by the Freedmen’s\nBureau, post , at 10 (dissenting opinion), but we see no\ninconsistency in recognizing that such evidence may reinforce an\nearly practice but cannot create one. In addition, many of the\nno-aid provisions belong to a more checkered tradition shared with\nthe Blaine Amendment of the 1870s. That proposal—which Congress\nnearly passed—would have added to the Federal Constitution a\nprovision similar to the state no-aid provisions, prohibiting\n",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus ESPINOZA et al. v . MONTANA\nDEPARTMENT OF REVENUE et al. certiorari to the supreme court of montana No. 18–1195. Argued January 22, 2020—Decided\nJune 30, 2020 The Montana Legislature established a program\nthat grants tax credits to those who donate to organizations that\naward scholarships for private school tuition. To reconcile the\nprogram with a provision of the Montana Constitution that bars\ngovernment aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination,” Art. X, §6(1), the Montana\nDepartment of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,” which prohibited\nfamilies from using the scholarships at religious schools. Three\nmothers who were blocked by Rule 1 from using scholarship funds for\ntheir children’s tuition at Stillwater Christian School sued the\nDepartment in state court, alleging that the Rule discriminated on\nthe basis of their religious views and the religious nature of the\nschool they had chosen. The trial court enjoined Rule 1. Reversing,\nthe Montana Supreme Court held that the program, unmodified by Rule\n1, aided religious schools in violation of the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. The Court further held that the\nviolation required invalidating the entire program. Held : The application of the\nno-aid provision discriminated against religious schools and the\nfamilies whose children attend or hope to attend them in violation\nof the Free Exercise Clause of the Federal Constitution.\nPp. 6–22. (a) The Free Exercise Clause “protects\nreligious observers against unequal treatment” and against “laws\nthat impose special disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer ,\n582 U. S. ___, ___. In Trinity Lutheran , this Court\nheld that disqualifying otherwise eligible recipients from a public\nbenefit “solely because of their religious character” imposes “a\npenalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most\nexacting scrutiny.” Id. , at ___. Here, the application of\nMontana’s no-aid provision excludes religious schools from public\nbenefits solely because of religious status. As a result, strict\nscrutiny applies. Pp. 6–12. (b) Contrary to the Department’s\ncontention, this case is not governed by Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S.\n712 . The plaintiff in Locke was denied a scholarship\n“because of what he proposed to do —use the funds to prepare\nfor the ministry,” an essentially religious endeavor. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. By contrast, Montana’s no-aid\nprovision does not zero in on any essentially religious course of\ninstruction but rather bars aid to a religious school “simply\nbecause of what it is”—a religious school. Id. , at ___. Locke also invoked a “historic and substantial” state\ninterest in not funding the training of clergy, 540 U. S., at\n725, but no comparable tradition supports Montana’s decision to\ndisqualify religious schools from government aid.\nPp. 12–16. (c) The proposed alternative approach\ninvolving a flexible case-by-case analysis is inconsistent with Trinity Lutheran . The protections of the Free Exercise\nClause do not depend on a varying case-by-case analysis regarding\nwhether discrimination against religious adherents would serve\nill-defined interests. Pp. 16–18. (d) To satisfy strict scrutiny, government\naction “must advance ‘interests of the highest order’ and must be\nnarrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.” Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546. Montana’s interest in creating greater separation of\nchurch and State than the Federal Constitution requires “cannot\nqualify as compelling” in the face of the infringement of free\nexercise here. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. The\nDepartment’s argument that the no-aid provision actually promotes\nreligious freedom is unavailing because an infringement of First\nAmendment rights cannot be justified by a State’s alternative view\nthat the infringement advances religious liberty. The Department’s\nargument is especially unconvincing because the infringement here\nbroadly burdens not only religious schools but also the families\nwhose children attend them. The Department suggests that the no-aid\nprovision safeguards public education by ensuring that government\nsupport is not diverted to private schools, but that interest does\nnot justify a no-aid provision that requires only religious private\nschools to bear its weight. Pp. 18–20. (e) Because the Free Exercise Clause\nbarred the application of the no-aid provision here, the Montana\nSupreme Court had no authority to invalidate the program on the\nbasis of that provision. The Department argues that the\ninvalidation of the entire program prevented a free exercise\nviolation, but the Department overlooks the Montana Supreme Court’s\nthreshold error of federal law. Had the Montana Supreme Court\nrecognized that the application of the no-aid provision was barred\nby the Free Exercise Clause, the Court would have had no basis for\ninvalidating the program. The Court was obligated to disregard the\nno-aid provision and decide this case consistent with the Federal\nConstitution. Pp. 20–22. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603, reversed and\nremanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 18–1195 _________________ KENDRA ESPINOZA, et al., PETITIONERS v. MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, et al. on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmontana [June 30, 2020] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. The Montana Legislature established a program to\nprovide tuition assistance to parents who send their children to\nprivate schools. The program grants a tax credit to anyone who\ndonates to certain organizations that in turn award scholarships to\nselected students attending such schools. When petitioners sought\nto use the scholarships at a religious school, the Montana Supreme\nCourt struck down the program. The Court relied on the “no-aid”\nprovision of the State Constitution, which prohibits any aid to a\nschool controlled by a “church, sect, or denomination.” The\nquestion presented is whether the Free Exercise Clause of the\nUnited States Constitution barred that application of the no-aid\nprovision. I A In 2015, the Montana Legislature sought “to\nprovide parental and student choice in education” by enacting a\nscholarship program for students attending private schools. 2015\nMont. Laws p. 2168, §7. The program grants a tax credit of up to\n$150 to any taxpayer who donates to a participating “student\nscholarship organization.” Mont. Code Ann. §§15–30–3103(1),\n–3111(1) (2019). The scholarship organizations then use the\ndonations to award scholarships to children for tuition at a\nprivate school. §§15–30–3102(7)(a), –3103(1)(c).[ 1 ] So far only one scholarship organization, Big\nSky Scholarships, has participated in the program. Big Sky focuses\non providing scholarships to families who face financial hardship\nor have children with disabilities. Scholarship organizations like\nBig Sky must, among other requirements, maintain an application\nprocess for awarding the scholarships; use at least 90% of all\ndonations on scholarship awards; and comply with state reporting\nand monitoring requirements. §§15–30–3103(1), –3105(1),\n–3113(1). A family whose child is awarded a scholarship\nunder the program may use it at any “qualified education\nprovider”—that is, any private school that meets certain\naccreditation, testing, and safety requirements. See\n§15–30–3102(7). Virtually every private school in Montana\nqualifies. Upon receiving a scholarship, the family designates its\nschool of choice, and the scholarship organization sends the\nscholarship funds directly to the school. §15–30–3104(1). Neither\nthe scholarship organization nor its donors can restrict awards to\nparticular types of schools. See §§15–30–3103(1)(b), –3111(1). The Montana Legislature allotted $3 million\nannually to fund the tax credits, beginning in 2016.\n§15–30–3111(5)(a). If the annual allotment is exhausted, it\nincreases by 10% the following year. Ibid. The program is\nslated to expire in 2023. 2015 Mont. Laws p. 2186, §33. The Montana Legislature also directed that the\nprogram be administered in accordance with Article X, section 6, of\nthe Montana Constitution, which contains a “no-aid” provision\nbarring government aid to sectarian schools. See Mont. Code Ann.\n§15–30–3101. In full, that provision states: “ Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools . . . . The legislature, counties, cities, towns,\nschool districts, and public corporations shall not make any direct\nor indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or\nmonies, or any grant of lands or other property for any sectarian\npurpose or to aid any church, school, academy, seminary, college,\nuniversity, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled\nin whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.” Mont.\nConst., Art. X, §6(1). Shortly after the scholarship program was\ncreated, the Montana Department of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,”\nover the objection of the Montana Attorney General. That\nadministrative rule prohibited families from using scholarships at\nreligious schools. Mont. Admin. Rule §42.4.802(1)(a) (2015). It did\nso by changing the definition of “qualified education provider” to\nexclude any school “owned or controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, religious sect, or denomination.” Ibid. The\nDepartment explained that the Rule was needed to reconcile the\nscholarship program with the no-aid provision of the Montana\nConstitution. The Montana Attorney General disagreed. In a\nletter to the Department, he advised that the Montana Constitution\ndid not require excluding religious schools from the program, and\nif it did, it would “very likely” violate the United States\nConstitution by discriminating against the schools and their\nstudents. See Complaint in No. DV–15–1152A (Dist. Ct. Flathead\nCty.), Exh. 3, pp. 2, 5–6. The Attorney General is not representing\nthe Department in this case. B This suit was brought by three mothers whose\nchildren attend Stillwater Christian School in northwestern\nMontana. Stillwater is a private Christian school that meets the\nstatutory criteria for “qualified education providers.” It serves\nstudents in prekindergarten through 12th grade, and petitioners\nchose the school in large part because it “teaches the same\nChristian values that [they] teach at home.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n152; see id. , at 138, 167. The child of one petitioner has\nalready received scholarships from Big Sky, and the other\npetitioners’ children are eligible for scholarships and planned to\napply. While in effect, however, Rule 1 blocked petitioners from\nusing scholarship funds for tuition at Stillwater. To overcome that\nobstacle, petitioners sued the Department of Revenue in Montana\nstate court. Petitioners claimed that Rule 1 conflicted with the\nstatute that created the scholarship program and could not be\njustified on the ground that it was compelled by the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. Petitioners further alleged that\nthe Rule discriminated on the basis of their religious views and\nthe religious nature of the school they had chosen for their\nchildren. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, holding that it\nwas based on a mistake of law. The court explained that the Rule\nwas not required by the no-aid provision, because that provision\nprohibits only “appropriations” that aid religious schools, “not\ntax credits.” Id. , at 94. The injunctive relief freed Big Sky to award\nscholarships to students regardless of whether they attended a\nreligious or secular school. For the school year beginning in fall\n2017, Big Sky received 59 applications and ultimately awarded 44\nscholarships of $500 each. The next year, Big Sky received 90\napplications and awarded 54 scholarships of $500 each. Several\nfamilies, most with incomes of $30,000 or less, used the\nscholarships to send their children to Stillwater Christian. In December 2018, the Montana Supreme Court\nreversed the trial court. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603. The Court\nfirst addressed the scholarship program unmodified by Rule 1,\nholding that the program aided religious schools in violation of\nthe no-aid provision of the Montana Constitution. In the Court’s\nview, the no-aid provision “broadly and strictly prohibits aid to\nsectarian schools.” Id. , at 459, 435 P. 3d, at 609. The\nscholarship program provided such aid by using tax credits to\n“subsidize tuition payments” at private schools that are\n“religiously affiliated” or “controlled in whole or in part by\nchurches.” Id. , at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at 612–613. In\nthat way, the scholarship program flouted the State Constitution’s\n“guarantee to all Montanans that their government will not use\nstate funds to aid religious schools.” Id. , at 467, 435\nP. 3d, at 614. The Montana Supreme Court went on to hold that\nthe violation of the no-aid provision required invalidating the\nentire scholarship program. The Court explained that the program\nprovided “no mechanism” for preventing aid from flowing to\nreligious schools, and therefore the scholarship program could not\n“under any circumstance” be construed as consistent with the\nno-aid provision. Id. , at 466–468, 435 P. 3d, at\n613–614. As a result, the tax credit is no longer available to\nsupport scholarships at either religious or secular private\nschools. The Montana Supreme Court acknowledged that “an\noverly-broad” application of the no-aid provision “could implicate\nfree exercise concerns” and that “there may be a case” where\n“prohibiting the aid would violate the Free Exercise Clause.” Id. , at 468, 435 P. 3d, at 614. But, the Court\nconcluded, “this is not one of those cases.” Ibid. Finally, the Court agreed with petitioners that\nthe Department had exceeded its authority in promulgating\nRule 1. The Court explained that the statute creating the\nscholarship program had broadly defined qualifying schools to\ninclude all private schools, including religious ones, and the\nDepartment lacked authority to “transform” that definition with an\nadministrative rule. Id. , at 468–469, 435 P. 3d, at\n614–615. Several Justices wrote separately. All agreed\nthat Rule 1 was invalid, but they expressed differing views on\nwhether the scholarship program was consistent with the Montana and\nUnited States Constitutions. Justice Gustafson’s concurrence argued\nthat the program violated not only Montana’s no-aid provision but\nalso the Federal Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. Id. , at 475–479, 435 P. 3d, at 619–621. Justice\nSandefur echoed the majority’s conclusion that applying the no-aid\nprovision was consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, and he\ndismissed the “modern jurisprudence” of that Clause as\n“unnecessarily complicate[d]” due to “increasingly value-driven\nhairsplitting and overstretching.” Id. , at 482–484, 435\nP. 3d, at 623–624. Two Justices dissented. Justice Rice would have\nheld that the scholarship program was permissible under the no-aid\nprovision. He criticized the majority for invalidating the program\n“ sua sponte ,” contending that no party had challenged\nit under the State Constitution. Id. , at 495, 435\nP. 3d, at 631. Justice Baker also would have upheld the\nprogram. In her view, the no-aid provision did not bar the use of\nscholarships at religious schools, and free exercise concerns could\narise under the Federal Constitution if it did. Id. , at\n493–494, 435 P. 3d, at 630. We granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___\n(2019). II A The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment\nprovide that “Congress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof.” We have recognized a “ ‘play in the joints’ between what\nthe Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause\ncompels.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Locke v. Davey , 540\nU.S. 712 , 718 (2004)). Here, the parties do not dispute that\nthe scholarship program is permissible under the Establishment\nClause. Nor could they. We have repeatedly held that the\nEstablishment Clause is not offended when religious observers and\norganizations benefit from neutral government programs. See, e.g. , Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S.\n819 , 839 (1995). See also Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (noting the parties’ agreement\nthat the Establishment Clause was not violated by including\nchurches in a playground resurfacing program). Any Establishment\nClause objection to the scholarship program here is particularly\nunavailing because the government support makes its way to\nreligious schools only as a result of Montanans independently\nchoosing to spend their scholarships at such schools. See Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , 536 U.S.\n639 , 649–653 (2002). The Montana Supreme Court, however, held\nas a matter of state law that even such indirect government support\nqualified as “aid” prohibited under the Montana Constitution. The question for this Court is whether the Free\nExercise Clause precluded the Montana Supreme Court from applying\nMontana’s no-aid provision to bar religious schools from the\nscholarship program. For purposes of answering that question, we\naccept the Montana Supreme Court’s interpretation of state\nlaw—including its determination that the scholarship program\nprovided impermissible “aid” within the meaning of the Montana\nConstitution—and we assess whether excluding religious schools and\naffected families from that program was consistent with the Federal\nConstitution.[ 2 ] The Free Exercise Clause, which applies to the\nStates under the Fourteenth Amendment, “protects religious\nobservers against unequal treatment” and against “laws that impose\nspecial disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 9)\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310\nU.S. 296 , 303 (1940). Those “basic principle[s ]” have\nlong guided this Court. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 6–9). See, e.g. , Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U.S.\n1 , 16 (1947) (a State “cannot exclude individual Catholics,\nLutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers,\nPresbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of\ntheir faith, or lack of it , from receiving the benefits of\npublic welfare legislation”); Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , 449 (1988) (the Free Exercise Clause protects against laws\nthat “penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal\nshare of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other\ncitizens”). Most recently, Trinity Lutheran distilled\nthese and other decisions to the same effect into the\n“unremarkable” conclusion that disqualifying otherwise eligible\nrecipients from a public benefit “solely because of their religious\ncharacter” imposes “a penalty on the free exercise of religion that\ntriggers the most exacting scrutiny.” 582 U. S., at ___–___\n(slip op., at 9–10). In Trinity Lutheran , Missouri provided\ngrants to help nonprofit organizations pay for playground\nresurfacing, but a state policy disqualified any organization\n“owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 2). Because of that policy, an\notherwise eligible church-owned preschool was denied a grant to\nresurface its playground. Missouri’s policy discriminated against\nthe Church “simply because of what it is—a church,” and so the\npolicy was subject to the “strictest scrutiny,” which it failed. Id. , at ___–___ (slip op., at 11–15). We acknowledged that\nthe State had not “criminalized” the way in which the Church\nworshipped or “told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a\ncertain view of the Gospel.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 11).\nBut the State’s discriminatory policy was “odious to our\nConstitution all the same.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at\n15). Here too Montana’s no-aid provision bars\nreligious schools from public benefits solely because of the\nreligious character of the schools. The provision also bars parents\nwho wish to send their children to a religious school from those\nsame benefits, again solely because of the religious character of\nthe school. This is apparent from the plain text. The provision\nbars aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination.” Mont. Const., Art. X, §6(1).\nThe provision’s title—“Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools”—confirms that the provision singles out schools based on\ntheir religious character. Ibid. And the Montana Supreme\nCourt explained that the provision forbids aid to any school that\nis “sectarian,” “religiously affiliated,” or “controlled in whole\nor in part by churches.” 393 Mont., at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at\n612–613. The provision plainly excludes schools from government aid\nsolely because of religious status. See Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–10). The Department counters that Trinity\nLutheran does not govern here because the no-aid provision\napplies not because of the religious character of the recipients,\nbut because of how the funds would be used—for “religious\neducation.” Brief for Respondents 38. In Trinity Lutheran , a\nmajority of the Court concluded that the Missouri policy violated\nthe Free Exercise Clause because it discriminated on the basis of\nreligious status. A plurality declined to address discrimination\nwith respect to “religious uses of funding or other forms of\ndiscrimination.” 582 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 14, n.\n3). The plurality saw no need to consider such concerns because\nMissouri had expressly discriminated “based on religious identity,” ibid. , which was enough to invalidate the state policy\nwithout addressing how government funds were used. This case also turns expressly on religious\nstatus and not religious use. The Montana Supreme Court applied the\nno-aid provision solely by reference to religious status. The Court\nrepeatedly explained that the no-aid provision bars aid to “schools\ncontrolled in whole or in part by churches,” “sectarian schools,”\nand “religiously-affiliated schools.” 393 Mont., at 463–467, 435\nP. 3d, at 611–613. Applying this provision to the scholarship\nprogram, the Montana Supreme Court noted that most of the private\nschools that would benefit from the program were “religiously\naffiliated” and “controlled by churches,” and the Court ultimately\nconcluded that the scholarship program ran afoul of the Montana\nConstitution by aiding “schools controlled by churches.” Id. , at 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 613–614. The Montana\nConstitution discriminates based on religious status just like the\nMissouri policy in Trinity Lutheran , which excluded\norganizations “owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other\nreligious entity.” 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). The Department points to some language in the\ndecision below indicating that the no-aid provision has the goal or\neffect of ensuring that government aid does not end up being used\nfor “sectarian education” or “religious education.” 393 Mont., at\n460, 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 609, 613–614. The Department also\ncontrasts what it characterizes as the “completely non-religious”\nbenefit of playground resurfacing in Trinity Lutheran with\nthe unrestricted tuition aid at issue here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.\nGeneral school aid, the Department stresses, could be used for\nreligious ends by some recipients, particularly schools that\nbelieve faith should “ permeate [ ]” everything they do.\nBrief for Respondents 39 (quoting State ex rel. Chambers v. School Dist. No. 10 , 155 Mont. 422, 438, 472 P.2d 1013 , 1021 (1970)). See also post , at 8, 13\n(Breyer, J., dissenting). Regardless, those considerations were not the\nMontana Supreme Court’s basis for applying the no-aid provision to\nexclude religious schools; that hinged solely on religious status.\nStatus-based discrimination remains status based even if one of its\ngoals or effects is preventing religious organizations from putting\naid to religious uses. Undeterred by Trinity Lutheran , the\nMontana Supreme Court applied the no-aid provision to hold that\nreligious schools could not benefit from the scholarship program.\n393 Mont., at 464–468, 435 P. 3d, at 612–614. So applied, the\nprovision “impose[s] special disabilities on the basis of religious\nstatus” and “condition[s] the availability of benefits upon a\nrecipient’s willingness to surrender [its] religiously impelled\nstatus.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 9–10) (quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508\nU.S. 520 , 533 (1993), and McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U.S.\n618 , 626 (1978) (plurality opinion) (alterations omitted)). To\nbe eligible for government aid under the Montana Constitution, a\nschool must divorce itself from any religious control or\naffiliation. Placing such a condition on benefits or privileges\n“inevitably deters or discourages the exercise of First Amendment\nrights.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S.\n398 , 405 (1963) (alterations omitted)). The Free Exercise\nClause protects against even “indirect coercion,” and a State\n“punishe[s] the free exercise of religion” by disqualifying the\nreligious from government aid as Montana did here. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Such status-based\ndiscrimination is subject to “the strictest scrutiny.” Id. ,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). None of this is meant to suggest that we agree\nwith the Department, Brief for Respondents 36–40, that some lesser\ndegree of scrutiny applies to discrimination against religious uses\nof government aid. See Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546\n(striking down law designed to ban religious practice involving\nalleged animal cruelty, explaining that a law “target[ing]\nreligious conduct for distinctive treatment or advanc[ing]\nlegitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a\nreligious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare\ncases”). Some Members of the Court, moreover, have questioned\nwhether there is a meaningful distinction between discrimination\nbased on use or conduct and that based on status. See Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2)\n(Gorsuch, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in part) (citing, e.g. , Lukumi , 508 U.S.\n520 , and Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment\nSecurity Div. , 450 U.S.\n707 (1981)). We acknowledge the point but need not examine it\nhere. It is enough in this case to conclude that strict scrutiny\napplies under Trinity Lutheran because Montana’s no-aid\nprovision discriminates based on religious status. B Seeking to avoid Trinity Lutheran , the\nDepartment contends that this case is instead governed by Locke v. Davey , 540 U.S.\n712 (2004). See also post , at 5 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting); post , at 9 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Locke also involved a scholarship program. The State of\nWashington provided scholarships paid out of the State’s general\nfund to help students pursuing postsecondary education. The\nscholarships could be used at accredited religious and nonreligious\nschools alike, but Washington prohibited students from using the\nscholarships to pursue devotional theology degrees, which prepared\nstudents for a calling as clergy. This prohibition prevented Davey\nfrom using his scholarship to obtain a degree that would have\nenabled him to become a pastor. We held that Washington had not\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. Locke differs from this case in two\ncritical ways. First, Locke explained that Washington had\n“merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction”: the\n“essentially religious endeavor” of training a minister “to lead a\ncongregation.” Id. , at 721. Thus, Davey “was denied a\nscholarship because of what he proposed to do —use the funds\nto prepare for the ministry.” Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Apart from that narrow\nrestriction, Washington’s program allowed scholarships to be used\nat “pervasively religious schools” that incorporated religious\ninstruction throughout their classes. Locke , 540 U. S.,\nat 724–725. By contrast, Montana’s Constitution does not zero in on\nany particular “essentially religious” course of instruction at a\nreligious school. Rather, as we have explained, the no-aid\nprovision bars all aid to a religious school “simply because of\nwhat it is,” putting the school to a choice between being religious\nor receiving government benefits. Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). At the same time, the\nprovision puts families to a choice between sending their children\nto a religious school or receiving such benefits. Second, Locke invoked a “historic and\nsubstantial” state interest in not funding the training of clergy,\n540 U. S., at 725, explaining that “opposition to\n. . . funding ‘to support church leaders’ lay at the\nhistoric core of the Religion Clauses,” Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting Locke , 540\nU. S., at 722). As evidence of that tradition, the Court in Locke emphasized that the propriety of state-supported\nclergy was a central subject of founding-era debates, and that most\nstate constitutions from that era prohibited the expenditure of tax\ndollars to support the clergy. See id. , at 722–723. But no comparable “historic and substantial”\ntradition supports Montana’s decision to disqualify religious\nschools from government aid. In the founding era and the early 19th\ncentury, governments provided financial support to private schools,\nincluding denominational ones. “Far from prohibiting such support,\nthe early state constitutions and statutes actively encouraged this\npolicy.” L. Jorgenson, The State and the Non-Public School,\n1825–1925, p. 4 (1987); e.g., R. Gabel, Public Funds for\nChurch and Private Schools 210, 217–218, 221, 241–243 (1937); C.\nKaestle, Pillars of the Republic: Common Schools and American\nSociety, 1760–1860, pp. 166–167 (1983). Local governments provided\ngrants to private schools, including religious ones, for the\neducation of the poor. M. McConnell, et al., Religion and the\nConstitution 318–319 (4th ed. 2016). Even States with bans on\ngovernment-supported clergy, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\nGeorgia, provided various forms of aid to religious schools.\n See Kaestle, supra , at 166–167; Gabel, supra ,\nat 215–218, 241–245, 372–374; cf. Locke , 540 U. S., at\n723. Early federal aid (often land grants) went to religious\nschools. McConnell, supra , at 319. Congress provided support\nto denominational schools in the District of Columbia until 1848, ibid. , and Congress paid churches to run schools for\nAmerican Indians through the end of the 19th century, see Quick\nBear v. Leupp , 210 U.S.\n50 , 78 (1908); Gabel, supra , at 521–523. After the Civil\nWar, Congress spent large sums on education for emancipated\nfreedmen, often by supporting denominational schools in the South\nthrough the Freedmen’s Bureau. McConnell, supra , at\n323.[ 3 ] The Department argues that a tradition against state support for religious schools arose in the\nsecond half of the 19th century, as more than 30 States—including\nMontana—adopted no-aid provisions. See Brief for Respondents 40–42\nand App. D. Such a development, of course, cannot by itself\nestablish an early American tradition. Justice Sotomayor questions\nour reliance on aid provided during the same era by the Freedmen’s\nBureau, post , at 10 (dissenting opinion), but we see no\ninconsistency in recognizing that such evidence may reinforce an\nearly practice but cannot create one. In addition, many of the\nno-aid provisions belong to a more checkered tradition shared with\nthe Blaine Amendment of the 1870s. That proposal—which Congress\nnearly passed—would have added to the Federal Constitution a\nprovision similar to the state no-aid provisions, prohibiting\n",

MONTANA\nDEPARTMENT OF REVENUE et al. certiorari to the supreme court of montana No. 18–1195. Argued January 22, 2020—Decided\nJune 30, 2020 The Montana Legislature established a program\nthat grants tax credits to those who donate to organizations that\naward scholarships for private school tuition. To reconcile the\nprogram with a provision of the Montana Constitution that bars\ngovernment aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination,” Art. X, §6(1), the Montana\nDepartment of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,” which prohibited\nfamilies from using the scholarships at religious schools. Three\nmothers who were blocked by Rule 1 from using scholarship funds for\ntheir children’s tuition at Stillwater Christian School sued the\nDepartment in state court, alleging that the Rule discriminated on\nthe basis of their religious views and the religious nature of the\nschool they had chosen. The trial court enjoined Rule 1. Reversing,\nthe Montana Supreme Court held that the program, unmodified by Rule\n1, aided religious schools in violation of the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. The Court further held that the\nviolation required invalidating the entire program. Held : The application of the\nno-aid provision discriminated against religious schools and the\nfamilies whose children attend or hope to attend them in violation\nof the Free Exercise Clause of the Federal Constitution.\nPp. 6–22. (a) The Free Exercise Clause “protects\nreligious observers against unequal treatment” and against “laws\nthat impose special disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer ,\n582 U. S. ___, ___. In Trinity Lutheran , this Court\nheld that disqualifying otherwise eligible recipients from a public\nbenefit “solely because of their religious character” imposes “a\npenalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most\nexacting scrutiny.” Id. , at ___. Here, the application of\nMontana’s no-aid provision excludes religious schools from public\nbenefits solely because of religious status. As a result, strict\nscrutiny applies. Pp. 6–12. (b) Contrary to the Department’s\ncontention, this case is not governed by Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S.\n712 . The plaintiff in Locke was denied a scholarship\n“because of what he proposed to do —use the funds to prepare\nfor the ministry,” an essentially religious endeavor. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. By contrast, Montana’s no-aid\nprovision does not zero in on any essentially religious course of\ninstruction but rather bars aid to a religious school “simply\nbecause of what it is”—a religious school. Id. , at ___. Locke also invoked a “historic and substantial” state\ninterest in not funding the training of clergy, 540 U. S., at\n725, but no comparable tradition supports Montana’s decision to\ndisqualify religious schools from government aid.\nPp. 12–16. (c) The proposed alternative approach\ninvolving a flexible case-by-case analysis is inconsistent with Trinity Lutheran . The protections of the Free Exercise\nClause do not depend on a varying case-by-case analysis regarding\nwhether discrimination against religious adherents would serve\nill-defined interests. Pp. 16–18. (d) To satisfy strict scrutiny, government\naction “must advance ‘interests of the highest order’ and must be\nnarrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.” Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546. Montana’s interest in creating greater separation of\nchurch and State than the Federal Constitution requires “cannot\nqualify as compelling” in the face of the infringement of free\nexercise here. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. The\nDepartment’s argument that the no-aid provision actually promotes\nreligious freedom is unavailing because an infringement of First\nAmendment rights cannot be justified by a State’s alternative view\nthat the infringement advances religious liberty. The Department’s\nargument is especially unconvincing because the infringement here\nbroadly burdens not only religious schools but also the families\nwhose children attend them. The Department suggests that the no-aid\nprovision safeguards public education by ensuring that government\nsupport is not diverted to private schools, but that interest does\nnot justify a no-aid provision that requires only religious private\nschools to bear its weight. Pp. 18–20. (e) Because the Free Exercise Clause\nbarred the application of the no-aid provision here, the Montana\nSupreme Court had no authority to invalidate the program on the\nbasis of that provision. The Department argues that the\ninvalidation of the entire program prevented a free exercise\nviolation, but the Department overlooks the Montana Supreme Court’s\nthreshold error of federal law. Had the Montana Supreme Court\nrecognized that the application of the no-aid provision was barred\nby the Free Exercise Clause, the Court would have had no basis for\ninvalidating the program. The Court was obligated to disregard the\nno-aid provision and decide this case consistent with the Federal\nConstitution. Pp. 20–22. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603, reversed and\nremanded.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 18–1195 _________________ KENDRA ESPINOZA, et al., PETITIONERS v. MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, et al. on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmontana [June 30, 2020] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. The Montana Legislature established a program to\nprovide tuition assistance to parents who send their children to\nprivate schools. The program grants a tax credit to anyone who\ndonates to certain organizations that in turn award scholarships to\nselected students attending such schools. When petitioners sought\nto use the scholarships at a religious school, the Montana Supreme\nCourt struck down the program. The Court relied on the “no-aid”\nprovision of the State Constitution, which prohibits any aid to a\nschool controlled by a “church, sect, or denomination.” The\nquestion presented is whether the Free Exercise Clause of the\nUnited States Constitution barred that application of the no-aid\nprovision. I A In 2015, the Montana Legislature sought “to\nprovide parental and student choice in education” by enacting a\nscholarship program for students attending private schools. 2015\nMont. Laws p. 2168, §7. The program grants a tax credit of up to\n$150 to any taxpayer who donates to a participating “student\nscholarship organization.” Mont. Code Ann. §§15–30–3103(1),\n–3111(1) (2019). The scholarship organizations then use the\ndonations to award scholarships to children for tuition at a\nprivate school. §§15–30–3102(7)(a), –3103(1)(c).[ 1 ] So far only one scholarship organization, Big\nSky Scholarships, has participated in the program. Big Sky focuses\non providing scholarships to families who face financial hardship\nor have children with disabilities. Scholarship organizations like\nBig Sky must, among other requirements, maintain an application\nprocess for awarding the scholarships; use at least 90% of all\ndonations on scholarship awards; and comply with state reporting\nand monitoring requirements. §§15–30–3103(1), –3105(1),\n–3113(1). A family whose child is awarded a scholarship\nunder the program may use it at any “qualified education\nprovider”—that is, any private school that meets certain\naccreditation, testing, and safety requirements. See\n§15–30–3102(7). Virtually every private school in Montana\nqualifies. Upon receiving a scholarship, the family designates its\nschool of choice, and the scholarship organization sends the\nscholarship funds directly to the school. §15–30–3104(1). Neither\nthe scholarship organization nor its donors can restrict awards to\nparticular types of schools. See §§15–30–3103(1)(b), –3111(1). The Montana Legislature allotted $3 million\nannually to fund the tax credits, beginning in 2016.\n§15–30–3111(5)(a). If the annual allotment is exhausted, it\nincreases by 10% the following year. Ibid. The program is\nslated to expire in 2023. 2015 Mont. Laws p. 2186, §33. The Montana Legislature also directed that the\nprogram be administered in accordance with Article X, section 6, of\nthe Montana Constitution, which contains a “no-aid” provision\nbarring government aid to sectarian schools. See Mont. Code Ann.\n§15–30–3101. In full, that provision states: “ Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools . . . . The legislature, counties, cities, towns,\nschool districts, and public corporations shall not make any direct\nor indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or\nmonies, or any grant of lands or other property for any sectarian\npurpose or to aid any church, school, academy, seminary, college,\nuniversity, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled\nin whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.” Mont.\nConst., Art. X, §6(1). Shortly after the scholarship program was\ncreated, the Montana Department of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,”\nover the objection of the Montana Attorney General. That\nadministrative rule prohibited families from using scholarships at\nreligious schools. Mont. Admin. Rule §42.4.802(1)(a) (2015). It did\nso by changing the definition of “qualified education provider” to\nexclude any school “owned or controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, religious sect, or denomination.” Ibid. The\nDepartment explained that the Rule was needed to reconcile the\nscholarship program with the no-aid provision of the Montana\nConstitution. The Montana Attorney General disagreed. In a\nletter to the Department, he advised that the Montana Constitution\ndid not require excluding religious schools from the program, and\nif it did, it would “very likely” violate the United States\nConstitution by discriminating against the schools and their\nstudents. See Complaint in No. DV–15–1152A (Dist. Ct. Flathead\nCty.), Exh. 3, pp. 2, 5–6. The Attorney General is not representing\nthe Department in this case. B This suit was brought by three mothers whose\nchildren attend Stillwater Christian School in northwestern\nMontana. Stillwater is a private Christian school that meets the\nstatutory criteria for “qualified education providers.” It serves\nstudents in prekindergarten through 12th grade, and petitioners\nchose the school in large part because it “teaches the same\nChristian values that [they] teach at home.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n152; see id. , at 138, 167. The child of one petitioner has\nalready received scholarships from Big Sky, and the other\npetitioners’ children are eligible for scholarships and planned to\napply. While in effect, however, Rule 1 blocked petitioners from\nusing scholarship funds for tuition at Stillwater. To overcome that\nobstacle, petitioners sued the Department of Revenue in Montana\nstate court. Petitioners claimed that Rule 1 conflicted with the\nstatute that created the scholarship program and could not be\njustified on the ground that it was compelled by the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. Petitioners further alleged that\nthe Rule discriminated on the basis of their religious views and\nthe religious nature of the school they had chosen for their\nchildren. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, holding that it\nwas based on a mistake of law. The court explained that the Rule\nwas not required by the no-aid provision, because that provision\nprohibits only “appropriations” that aid religious schools, “not\ntax credits.” Id. , at 94. The injunctive relief freed Big Sky to award\nscholarships to students regardless of whether they attended a\nreligious or secular school. For the school year beginning in fall\n2017, Big Sky received 59 applications and ultimately awarded 44\nscholarships of $500 each. The next year, Big Sky received 90\napplications and awarded 54 scholarships of $500 each. Several\nfamilies, most with incomes of $30,000 or less, used the\nscholarships to send their children to Stillwater Christian. In December 2018, the Montana Supreme Court\nreversed the trial court. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603. The Court\nfirst addressed the scholarship program unmodified by Rule 1,\nholding that the program aided religious schools in violation of\nthe no-aid provision of the Montana Constitution. In the Court’s\nview, the no-aid provision “broadly and strictly prohibits aid to\nsectarian schools.” Id. , at 459, 435 P. 3d, at 609. The\nscholarship program provided such aid by using tax credits to\n“subsidize tuition payments” at private schools that are\n“religiously affiliated” or “controlled in whole or in part by\nchurches.” Id. , at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at 612–613. In\nthat way, the scholarship program flouted the State Constitution’s\n“guarantee to all Montanans that their government will not use\nstate funds to aid religious schools.” Id. , at 467, 435\nP. 3d, at 614. The Montana Supreme Court went on to hold that\nthe violation of the no-aid provision required invalidating the\nentire scholarship program. The Court explained that the program\nprovided “no mechanism” for preventing aid from flowing to\nreligious schools, and therefore the scholarship program could not\n“under any circumstance” be construed as consistent with the\nno-aid provision. Id. , at 466–468, 435 P. 3d, at\n613–614. As a result, the tax credit is no longer available to\nsupport scholarships at either religious or secular private\nschools. The Montana Supreme Court acknowledged that “an\noverly-broad” application of the no-aid provision “could implicate\nfree exercise concerns” and that “there may be a case” where\n“prohibiting the aid would violate the Free Exercise Clause.” Id. , at 468, 435 P. 3d, at 614. But, the Court\nconcluded, “this is not one of those cases.” Ibid. Finally, the Court agreed with petitioners that\nthe Department had exceeded its authority in promulgating\nRule 1. The Court explained that the statute creating the\nscholarship program had broadly defined qualifying schools to\ninclude all private schools, including religious ones, and the\nDepartment lacked authority to “transform” that definition with an\nadministrative rule. Id. , at 468–469, 435 P. 3d, at\n614–615. Several Justices wrote separately. All agreed\nthat Rule 1 was invalid, but they expressed differing views on\nwhether the scholarship program was consistent with the Montana and\nUnited States Constitutions. Justice Gustafson’s concurrence argued\nthat the program violated not only Montana’s no-aid provision but\nalso the Federal Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. Id. , at 475–479, 435 P. 3d, at 619–621. Justice\nSandefur echoed the majority’s conclusion that applying the no-aid\nprovision was consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, and he\ndismissed the “modern jurisprudence” of that Clause as\n“unnecessarily complicate[d]” due to “increasingly value-driven\nhairsplitting and overstretching.” Id. , at 482–484, 435\nP. 3d, at 623–624. Two Justices dissented. Justice Rice would have\nheld that the scholarship program was permissible under the no-aid\nprovision. He criticized the majority for invalidating the program\n“ sua sponte ,” contending that no party had challenged\nit under the State Constitution. Id. , at 495, 435\nP. 3d, at 631. Justice Baker also would have upheld the\nprogram. In her view, the no-aid provision did not bar the use of\nscholarships at religious schools, and free exercise concerns could\narise under the Federal Constitution if it did. Id. , at\n493–494, 435 P. 3d, at 630. We granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___\n(2019). II A The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment\nprovide that “Congress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof.” We have recognized a “ ‘play in the joints’ between what\nthe Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause\ncompels.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Locke v. Davey , 540\nU.S. 712 , 718 (2004)). Here, the parties do not dispute that\nthe scholarship program is permissible under the Establishment\nClause. Nor could they. We have repeatedly held that the\nEstablishment Clause is not offended when religious observers and\norganizations benefit from neutral government programs. See, e.g. , Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S.\n819 , 839 (1995). See also Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (noting the parties’ agreement\nthat the Establishment Clause was not violated by including\nchurches in a playground resurfacing program). Any Establishment\nClause objection to the scholarship program here is particularly\nunavailing because the government support makes its way to\nreligious schools only as a result of Montanans independently\nchoosing to spend their scholarships at such schools. See Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , 536 U.S.\n639 , 649–653 (2002). The Montana Supreme Court, however, held\nas a matter of state law that even such indirect government support\nqualified as “aid” prohibited under the Montana Constitution. The question for this Court is whether the Free\nExercise Clause precluded the Montana Supreme Court from applying\nMontana’s no-aid provision to bar religious schools from the\nscholarship program. For purposes of answering that question, we\naccept the Montana Supreme Court’s interpretation of state\nlaw—including its determination that the scholarship program\nprovided impermissible “aid” within the meaning of the Montana\nConstitution—and we assess whether excluding religious schools and\naffected families from that program was consistent with the Federal\nConstitution.[ 2 ] The Free Exercise Clause, which applies to the\nStates under the Fourteenth Amendment, “protects religious\nobservers against unequal treatment” and against “laws that impose\nspecial disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 9)\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310\nU.S. 296 , 303 (1940). Those “basic principle[s ]” have\nlong guided this Court. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 6–9). See, e.g. , Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U.S.\n1 , 16 (1947) (a State “cannot exclude individual Catholics,\nLutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers,\nPresbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of\ntheir faith, or lack of it , from receiving the benefits of\npublic welfare legislation”); Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , 449 (1988) (the Free Exercise Clause protects against laws\nthat “penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal\nshare of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other\ncitizens”). Most recently, Trinity Lutheran distilled\nthese and other decisions to the same effect into the\n“unremarkable” conclusion that disqualifying otherwise eligible\nrecipients from a public benefit “solely because of their religious\ncharacter” imposes “a penalty on the free exercise of religion that\ntriggers the most exacting scrutiny.” 582 U. S., at ___–___\n(slip op., at 9–10). In Trinity Lutheran , Missouri provided\ngrants to help nonprofit organizations pay for playground\nresurfacing, but a state policy disqualified any organization\n“owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 2). Because of that policy, an\notherwise eligible church-owned preschool was denied a grant to\nresurface its playground. Missouri’s policy discriminated against\nthe Church “simply because of what it is—a church,” and so the\npolicy was subject to the “strictest scrutiny,” which it failed. Id. , at ___–___ (slip op., at 11–15). We acknowledged that\nthe State had not “criminalized” the way in which the Church\nworshipped or “told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a\ncertain view of the Gospel.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 11).\nBut the State’s discriminatory policy was “odious to our\nConstitution all the same.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at\n15). Here too Montana’s no-aid provision bars\nreligious schools from public benefits solely because of the\nreligious character of the schools. The provision also bars parents\nwho wish to send their children to a religious school from those\nsame benefits, again solely because of the religious character of\nthe school. This is apparent from the plain text. The provision\nbars aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination.” Mont. Const., Art. X, §6(1).\nThe provision’s title—“Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools”—confirms that the provision singles out schools based on\ntheir religious character. Ibid. And the Montana Supreme\nCourt explained that the provision forbids aid to any school that\nis “sectarian,” “religiously affiliated,” or “controlled in whole\nor in part by churches.” 393 Mont., at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at\n612–613. The provision plainly excludes schools from government aid\nsolely because of religious status. See Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–10). The Department counters that Trinity\nLutheran does not govern here because the no-aid provision\napplies not because of the religious character of the recipients,\nbut because of how the funds would be used—for “religious\neducation.” Brief for Respondents 38. In Trinity Lutheran , a\nmajority of the Court concluded that the Missouri policy violated\nthe Free Exercise Clause because it discriminated on the basis of\nreligious status. A plurality declined to address discrimination\nwith respect to “religious uses of funding or other forms of\ndiscrimination.” 582 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 14, n.\n3). The plurality saw no need to consider such concerns because\nMissouri had expressly discriminated “based on religious identity,” ibid. , which was enough to invalidate the state policy\nwithout addressing how government funds were used. This case also turns expressly on religious\nstatus and not religious use. The Montana Supreme Court applied the\nno-aid provision solely by reference to religious status. The Court\nrepeatedly explained that the no-aid provision bars aid to “schools\ncontrolled in whole or in part by churches,” “sectarian schools,”\nand “religiously-affiliated schools.” 393 Mont., at 463–467, 435\nP. 3d, at 611–613. Applying this provision to the scholarship\nprogram, the Montana Supreme Court noted that most of the private\nschools that would benefit from the program were “religiously\naffiliated” and “controlled by churches,” and the Court ultimately\nconcluded that the scholarship program ran afoul of the Montana\nConstitution by aiding “schools controlled by churches.” Id. , at 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 613–614. The Montana\nConstitution discriminates based on religious status just like the\nMissouri policy in Trinity Lutheran , which excluded\norganizations “owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other\nreligious entity.” 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). The Department points to some language in the\ndecision below indicating that the no-aid provision has the goal or\neffect of ensuring that government aid does not end up being used\nfor “sectarian education” or “religious education.” 393 Mont., at\n460, 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 609, 613–614. The Department also\ncontrasts what it characterizes as the “completely non-religious”\nbenefit of playground resurfacing in Trinity Lutheran with\nthe unrestricted tuition aid at issue here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.\nGeneral school aid, the Department stresses, could be used for\nreligious ends by some recipients, particularly schools that\nbelieve faith should “ permeate [ ]” everything they do.\nBrief for Respondents 39 (quoting State ex rel. Chambers v. School Dist. No. 10 , 155 Mont. 422, 438, 472 P.2d 1013 , 1021 (1970)). See also post , at 8, 13\n(Breyer, J., dissenting). Regardless, those considerations were not the\nMontana Supreme Court’s basis for applying the no-aid provision to\nexclude religious schools; that hinged solely on religious status.\nStatus-based discrimination remains status based even if one of its\ngoals or effects is preventing religious organizations from putting\naid to religious uses. Undeterred by Trinity Lutheran , the\nMontana Supreme Court applied the no-aid provision to hold that\nreligious schools could not benefit from the scholarship program.\n393 Mont., at 464–468, 435 P. 3d, at 612–614. So applied, the\nprovision “impose[s] special disabilities on the basis of religious\nstatus” and “condition[s] the availability of benefits upon a\nrecipient’s willingness to surrender [its] religiously impelled\nstatus.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 9–10) (quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508\nU.S. 520 , 533 (1993), and McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U.S.\n618 , 626 (1978) (plurality opinion) (alterations omitted)). To\nbe eligible for government aid under the Montana Constitution, a\nschool must divorce itself from any religious control or\naffiliation. Placing such a condition on benefits or privileges\n“inevitably deters or discourages the exercise of First Amendment\nrights.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S.\n398 , 405 (1963) (alterations omitted)). The Free Exercise\nClause protects against even “indirect coercion,” and a State\n“punishe[s] the free exercise of religion” by disqualifying the\nreligious from government aid as Montana did here. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Such status-based\ndiscrimination is subject to “the strictest scrutiny.” Id. ,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). None of this is meant to suggest that we agree\nwith the Department, Brief for Respondents 36–40, that some lesser\ndegree of scrutiny applies to discrimination against religious uses\nof government aid. See Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546\n(striking down law designed to ban religious practice involving\nalleged animal cruelty, explaining that a law “target[ing]\nreligious conduct for distinctive treatment or advanc[ing]\nlegitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a\nreligious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare\ncases”). Some Members of the Court, moreover, have questioned\nwhether there is a meaningful distinction between discrimination\nbased on use or conduct and that based on status. See Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2)\n(Gorsuch, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in part) (citing, e.g. , Lukumi , 508 U.S.\n520 , and Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment\nSecurity Div. , 450 U.S.\n707 (1981)). We acknowledge the point but need not examine it\nhere. It is enough in this case to conclude that strict scrutiny\napplies under Trinity Lutheran because Montana’s no-aid\nprovision discriminates based on religious status. B Seeking to avoid Trinity Lutheran , the\nDepartment contends that this case is instead governed by Locke v. Davey , 540 U.S.\n712 (2004). See also post , at 5 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting); post , at 9 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Locke also involved a scholarship program. The State of\nWashington provided scholarships paid out of the State’s general\nfund to help students pursuing postsecondary education. The\nscholarships could be used at accredited religious and nonreligious\nschools alike, but Washington prohibited students from using the\nscholarships to pursue devotional theology degrees, which prepared\nstudents for a calling as clergy. This prohibition prevented Davey\nfrom using his scholarship to obtain a degree that would have\nenabled him to become a pastor. We held that Washington had not\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. Locke differs from this case in two\ncritical ways. First, Locke explained that Washington had\n“merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction”: the\n“essentially religious endeavor” of training a minister “to lead a\ncongregation.” Id. , at 721. Thus, Davey “was denied a\nscholarship because of what he proposed to do —use the funds\nto prepare for the ministry.” Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Apart from that narrow\nrestriction, Washington’s program allowed scholarships to be used\nat “pervasively religious schools” that incorporated religious\ninstruction throughout their classes. Locke , 540 U. S.,\nat 724–725. By contrast, Montana’s Constitution does not zero in on\nany particular “essentially religious” course of instruction at a\nreligious school. Rather, as we have explained, the no-aid\nprovision bars all aid to a religious school “simply because of\nwhat it is,” putting the school to a choice between being religious\nor receiving government benefits. Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). At the same time, the\nprovision puts families to a choice between sending their children\nto a religious school or receiving such benefits. Second, Locke invoked a “historic and\nsubstantial” state interest in not funding the training of clergy,\n540 U. S., at 725, explaining that “opposition to\n. . . funding ‘to support church leaders’ lay at the\nhistoric core of the Religion Clauses,” Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting Locke , 540\nU. S., at 722). As evidence of that tradition, the Court in Locke emphasized that the propriety of state-supported\nclergy was a central subject of founding-era debates, and that most\nstate constitutions from that era prohibited the expenditure of tax\ndollars to support the clergy. See id. , at 722–723. But no comparable “historic and substantial”\ntradition supports Montana’s decision to disqualify religious\nschools from government aid. In the founding era and the early 19th\ncentury, governments provided financial support to private schools,\nincluding denominational ones. “Far from prohibiting such support,\nthe early state constitutions and statutes actively encouraged this\npolicy.” L. Jorgenson, The State and the Non-Public School,\n1825–1925, p. 4 (1987); e.g., R. Gabel, Public Funds for\nChurch and Private Schools 210, 217–218, 221, 241–243 (1937); C.\nKaestle, Pillars of the Republic: Common Schools and American\nSociety, 1760–1860, pp. 166–167 (1983). Local governments provided\ngrants to private schools, including religious ones, for the\neducation of the poor. M. McConnell, et al., Religion and the\nConstitution 318–319 (4th ed. 2016). Even States with bans on\ngovernment-supported clergy, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\nGeorgia, provided various forms of aid to religious schools.\n See Kaestle, supra , at 166–167; Gabel, supra ,\nat 215–218, 241–245, 372–374; cf. Locke , 540 U. S., at\n723. Early federal aid (often land grants) went to religious\nschools. McConnell, supra , at 319. Congress provided support\nto denominational schools in the District of Columbia until 1848, ibid. , and Congress paid churches to run schools for\nAmerican Indians through the end of the 19th century, see Quick\nBear v. Leupp , 210 U.S.\n50 , 78 (1908); Gabel, supra , at 521–523. After the Civil\nWar, Congress spent large sums on education for emancipated\nfreedmen, often by supporting denominational schools in the South\nthrough the Freedmen’s Bureau. McConnell, supra , at\n323.[ 3 ] The Department argues that a tradition against state support for religious schools arose in the\nsecond half of the 19th century, as more than 30 States—including\nMontana—adopted no-aid provisions. See Brief for Respondents 40–42\nand App. D. Such a development, of course, cannot by itself\nestablish an early American tradition. Justice Sotomayor questions\nour reliance on aid provided during the same era by the Freedmen’s\nBureau, post , at 10 (dissenting opinion), but we see no\ninconsistency in recognizing that such evidence may reinforce an\nearly practice but cannot create one. In addition, many of the\nno-aid provisions belong to a more checkered tradition shared with\nthe Blaine Amendment of the 1870s. That proposal—which Congress\nnearly passed—would have added to the Federal Constitution a\nprovision similar to the state no-aid provisions, prohibiting\n",

MONTANA\nDEPARTMENT OF REVENUE et al. certiorari to the supreme court of montana No. 18–1195. Argued January 22, 2020—Decided\nJune 30, 2020 The Montana Legislature established a program\nthat grants tax credits to those who donate to organizations that\naward scholarships for private school tuition. To reconcile the\nprogram with a provision of the Montana Constitution that bars\ngovernment aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination,” Art. X, §6(1), the Montana\nDepartment of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,” which prohibited\nfamilies from using the scholarships at religious schools. Three\nmothers who were blocked by Rule 1 from using scholarship funds for\ntheir children’s tuition at Stillwater Christian School sued the\nDepartment in state court, alleging that the Rule discriminated on\nthe basis of their religious views and the religious nature of the\nschool they had chosen. The trial court enjoined Rule 1. Reversing,\nthe Montana Supreme Court held that the program, unmodified by Rule\n1, aided religious schools in violation of the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. The Court further held that the\nviolation required invalidating the entire program. Held : The application of the\nno-aid provision discriminated against religious schools and the\nfamilies whose children attend or hope to attend them in violation\nof the Free Exercise Clause of the Federal Constitution.\nPp. 6–22. (a) The Free Exercise Clause “protects\nreligious observers against unequal treatment” and against “laws\nthat impose special disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer ,\n582 U. S. ___, ___. In Trinity Lutheran , this Court\nheld that disqualifying otherwise eligible recipients from a public\nbenefit “solely because of their religious character” imposes “a\npenalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most\nexacting scrutiny.” Id. , at ___. Here, the application of\nMontana’s no-aid provision excludes religious schools from public\nbenefits solely because of religious status. As a result, strict\nscrutiny applies. Pp. 6–12. (b) Contrary to the Department’s\ncontention, this case is not governed by Locke v. Davey, 540 U.S.\n712 . The plaintiff in Locke was denied a scholarship\n“because of what he proposed to do —use the funds to prepare\nfor the ministry,” an essentially religious endeavor. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. By contrast, Montana’s no-aid\nprovision does not zero in on any essentially religious course of\ninstruction but rather bars aid to a religious school “simply\nbecause of what it is”—a religious school. Id. , at ___. Locke also invoked a “historic and substantial” state\ninterest in not funding the training of clergy, 540 U. S., at\n725, but no comparable tradition supports Montana’s decision to\ndisqualify religious schools from government aid.\nPp. 12–16. (c) The proposed alternative approach\ninvolving a flexible case-by-case analysis is inconsistent with Trinity Lutheran . The protections of the Free Exercise\nClause do not depend on a varying case-by-case analysis regarding\nwhether discrimination against religious adherents would serve\nill-defined interests. Pp. 16–18. (d) To satisfy strict scrutiny, government\naction “must advance ‘interests of the highest order’ and must be\nnarrowly tailored in pursuit of those interests.” Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546. Montana’s interest in creating greater separation of\nchurch and State than the Federal Constitution requires “cannot\nqualify as compelling” in the face of the infringement of free\nexercise here. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. The\nDepartment’s argument that the no-aid provision actually promotes\nreligious freedom is unavailing because an infringement of First\nAmendment rights cannot be justified by a State’s alternative view\nthat the infringement advances religious liberty. The Department’s\nargument is especially unconvincing because the infringement here\nbroadly burdens not only religious schools but also the families\nwhose children attend them. The Department suggests that the no-aid\nprovision safeguards public education by ensuring that government\nsupport is not diverted to private schools, but that interest does\nnot justify a no-aid provision that requires only religious private\nschools to bear its weight. Pp. 18–20. (e) Because the Free Exercise Clause\nbarred the application of the no-aid provision here, the Montana\nSupreme Court had no authority to invalidate the program on the\nbasis of that provision. The Department argues that the\ninvalidation of the entire program prevented a free exercise\nviolation, but the Department overlooks the Montana Supreme Court’s\nthreshold error of federal law. Had the Montana Supreme Court\nrecognized that the application of the no-aid provision was barred\nby the Free Exercise Clause, the Court would have had no basis for\ninvalidating the program. The Court was obligated to disregard the\nno-aid provision and decide this case consistent with the Federal\nConstitution. Pp. 20–22. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603, reversed and\nremanded. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, in which Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ.,\njoined. Thomas, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which Gorsuch,\nJ., joined. Alito, J., and Gorsuch, J., filed concurring opinions.\nGinsburg, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Kagan, J.,\njoined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 18–1195 _________________ KENDRA ESPINOZA, et al., PETITIONERS v. MONTANA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE, et al. on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nmontana [June 30, 2020] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. The Montana Legislature established a program to\nprovide tuition assistance to parents who send their children to\nprivate schools. The program grants a tax credit to anyone who\ndonates to certain organizations that in turn award scholarships to\nselected students attending such schools. When petitioners sought\nto use the scholarships at a religious school, the Montana Supreme\nCourt struck down the program. The Court relied on the “no-aid”\nprovision of the State Constitution, which prohibits any aid to a\nschool controlled by a “church, sect, or denomination.” The\nquestion presented is whether the Free Exercise Clause of the\nUnited States Constitution barred that application of the no-aid\nprovision. I A In 2015, the Montana Legislature sought “to\nprovide parental and student choice in education” by enacting a\nscholarship program for students attending private schools. 2015\nMont. Laws p. 2168, §7. The program grants a tax credit of up to\n$150 to any taxpayer who donates to a participating “student\nscholarship organization.” Mont. Code Ann. §§15–30–3103(1),\n–3111(1) (2019). The scholarship organizations then use the\ndonations to award scholarships to children for tuition at a\nprivate school. §§15–30–3102(7)(a), –3103(1)(c).[ 1 ] So far only one scholarship organization, Big\nSky Scholarships, has participated in the program. Big Sky focuses\non providing scholarships to families who face financial hardship\nor have children with disabilities. Scholarship organizations like\nBig Sky must, among other requirements, maintain an application\nprocess for awarding the scholarships; use at least 90% of all\ndonations on scholarship awards; and comply with state reporting\nand monitoring requirements. §§15–30–3103(1), –3105(1),\n–3113(1). A family whose child is awarded a scholarship\nunder the program may use it at any “qualified education\nprovider”—that is, any private school that meets certain\naccreditation, testing, and safety requirements. See\n§15–30–3102(7). Virtually every private school in Montana\nqualifies. Upon receiving a scholarship, the family designates its\nschool of choice, and the scholarship organization sends the\nscholarship funds directly to the school. §15–30–3104(1). Neither\nthe scholarship organization nor its donors can restrict awards to\nparticular types of schools. See §§15–30–3103(1)(b), –3111(1). The Montana Legislature allotted $3 million\nannually to fund the tax credits, beginning in 2016.\n§15–30–3111(5)(a). If the annual allotment is exhausted, it\nincreases by 10% the following year. Ibid. The program is\nslated to expire in 2023. 2015 Mont. Laws p. 2186, §33. The Montana Legislature also directed that the\nprogram be administered in accordance with Article X, section 6, of\nthe Montana Constitution, which contains a “no-aid” provision\nbarring government aid to sectarian schools. See Mont. Code Ann.\n§15–30–3101. In full, that provision states: “ Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools . . . . The legislature, counties, cities, towns,\nschool districts, and public corporations shall not make any direct\nor indirect appropriation or payment from any public fund or\nmonies, or any grant of lands or other property for any sectarian\npurpose or to aid any church, school, academy, seminary, college,\nuniversity, or other literary or scientific institution, controlled\nin whole or in part by any church, sect, or denomination.” Mont.\nConst., Art. X, §6(1). Shortly after the scholarship program was\ncreated, the Montana Department of Revenue promulgated “Rule 1,”\nover the objection of the Montana Attorney General. That\nadministrative rule prohibited families from using scholarships at\nreligious schools. Mont. Admin. Rule §42.4.802(1)(a) (2015). It did\nso by changing the definition of “qualified education provider” to\nexclude any school “owned or controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, religious sect, or denomination.” Ibid. The\nDepartment explained that the Rule was needed to reconcile the\nscholarship program with the no-aid provision of the Montana\nConstitution. The Montana Attorney General disagreed. In a\nletter to the Department, he advised that the Montana Constitution\ndid not require excluding religious schools from the program, and\nif it did, it would “very likely” violate the United States\nConstitution by discriminating against the schools and their\nstudents. See Complaint in No. DV–15–1152A (Dist. Ct. Flathead\nCty.), Exh. 3, pp. 2, 5–6. The Attorney General is not representing\nthe Department in this case. B This suit was brought by three mothers whose\nchildren attend Stillwater Christian School in northwestern\nMontana. Stillwater is a private Christian school that meets the\nstatutory criteria for “qualified education providers.” It serves\nstudents in prekindergarten through 12th grade, and petitioners\nchose the school in large part because it “teaches the same\nChristian values that [they] teach at home.” App. to Pet. for Cert.\n152; see id. , at 138, 167. The child of one petitioner has\nalready received scholarships from Big Sky, and the other\npetitioners’ children are eligible for scholarships and planned to\napply. While in effect, however, Rule 1 blocked petitioners from\nusing scholarship funds for tuition at Stillwater. To overcome that\nobstacle, petitioners sued the Department of Revenue in Montana\nstate court. Petitioners claimed that Rule 1 conflicted with the\nstatute that created the scholarship program and could not be\njustified on the ground that it was compelled by the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision. Petitioners further alleged that\nthe Rule discriminated on the basis of their religious views and\nthe religious nature of the school they had chosen for their\nchildren. The trial court enjoined Rule 1, holding that it\nwas based on a mistake of law. The court explained that the Rule\nwas not required by the no-aid provision, because that provision\nprohibits only “appropriations” that aid religious schools, “not\ntax credits.” Id. , at 94. The injunctive relief freed Big Sky to award\nscholarships to students regardless of whether they attended a\nreligious or secular school. For the school year beginning in fall\n2017, Big Sky received 59 applications and ultimately awarded 44\nscholarships of $500 each. The next year, Big Sky received 90\napplications and awarded 54 scholarships of $500 each. Several\nfamilies, most with incomes of $30,000 or less, used the\nscholarships to send their children to Stillwater Christian. In December 2018, the Montana Supreme Court\nreversed the trial court. 393 Mont. 446, 435 P.3d 603. The Court\nfirst addressed the scholarship program unmodified by Rule 1,\nholding that the program aided religious schools in violation of\nthe no-aid provision of the Montana Constitution. In the Court’s\nview, the no-aid provision “broadly and strictly prohibits aid to\nsectarian schools.” Id. , at 459, 435 P. 3d, at 609. The\nscholarship program provided such aid by using tax credits to\n“subsidize tuition payments” at private schools that are\n“religiously affiliated” or “controlled in whole or in part by\nchurches.” Id. , at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at 612–613. In\nthat way, the scholarship program flouted the State Constitution’s\n“guarantee to all Montanans that their government will not use\nstate funds to aid religious schools.” Id. , at 467, 435\nP. 3d, at 614. The Montana Supreme Court went on to hold that\nthe violation of the no-aid provision required invalidating the\nentire scholarship program. The Court explained that the program\nprovided “no mechanism” for preventing aid from flowing to\nreligious schools, and therefore the scholarship program could not\n“under any circumstance” be construed as consistent with the\nno-aid provision. Id. , at 466–468, 435 P. 3d, at\n613–614. As a result, the tax credit is no longer available to\nsupport scholarships at either religious or secular private\nschools. The Montana Supreme Court acknowledged that “an\noverly-broad” application of the no-aid provision “could implicate\nfree exercise concerns” and that “there may be a case” where\n“prohibiting the aid would violate the Free Exercise Clause.” Id. , at 468, 435 P. 3d, at 614. But, the Court\nconcluded, “this is not one of those cases.” Ibid. Finally, the Court agreed with petitioners that\nthe Department had exceeded its authority in promulgating\nRule 1. The Court explained that the statute creating the\nscholarship program had broadly defined qualifying schools to\ninclude all private schools, including religious ones, and the\nDepartment lacked authority to “transform” that definition with an\nadministrative rule. Id. , at 468–469, 435 P. 3d, at\n614–615. Several Justices wrote separately. All agreed\nthat Rule 1 was invalid, but they expressed differing views on\nwhether the scholarship program was consistent with the Montana and\nUnited States Constitutions. Justice Gustafson’s concurrence argued\nthat the program violated not only Montana’s no-aid provision but\nalso the Federal Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses. Id. , at 475–479, 435 P. 3d, at 619–621. Justice\nSandefur echoed the majority’s conclusion that applying the no-aid\nprovision was consistent with the Free Exercise Clause, and he\ndismissed the “modern jurisprudence” of that Clause as\n“unnecessarily complicate[d]” due to “increasingly value-driven\nhairsplitting and overstretching.” Id. , at 482–484, 435\nP. 3d, at 623–624. Two Justices dissented. Justice Rice would have\nheld that the scholarship program was permissible under the no-aid\nprovision. He criticized the majority for invalidating the program\n“ sua sponte ,” contending that no party had challenged\nit under the State Constitution. Id. , at 495, 435\nP. 3d, at 631. Justice Baker also would have upheld the\nprogram. In her view, the no-aid provision did not bar the use of\nscholarships at religious schools, and free exercise concerns could\narise under the Federal Constitution if it did. Id. , at\n493–494, 435 P. 3d, at 630. We granted certiorari. 588 U. S. ___\n(2019). II A The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment\nprovide that “Congress shall make no law respecting an\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof.” We have recognized a “ ‘play in the joints’ between what\nthe Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause\ncompels.” Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6)\n(quoting Locke v. Davey , 540\nU.S. 712 , 718 (2004)). Here, the parties do not dispute that\nthe scholarship program is permissible under the Establishment\nClause. Nor could they. We have repeatedly held that the\nEstablishment Clause is not offended when religious observers and\norganizations benefit from neutral government programs. See, e.g. , Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S.\n819 , 839 (1995). See also Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (noting the parties’ agreement\nthat the Establishment Clause was not violated by including\nchurches in a playground resurfacing program). Any Establishment\nClause objection to the scholarship program here is particularly\nunavailing because the government support makes its way to\nreligious schools only as a result of Montanans independently\nchoosing to spend their scholarships at such schools. See Locke , 540 U. S., at 719; Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , 536 U.S.\n639 , 649–653 (2002). The Montana Supreme Court, however, held\nas a matter of state law that even such indirect government support\nqualified as “aid” prohibited under the Montana Constitution. The question for this Court is whether the Free\nExercise Clause precluded the Montana Supreme Court from applying\nMontana’s no-aid provision to bar religious schools from the\nscholarship program. For purposes of answering that question, we\naccept the Montana Supreme Court’s interpretation of state\nlaw—including its determination that the scholarship program\nprovided impermissible “aid” within the meaning of the Montana\nConstitution—and we assess whether excluding religious schools and\naffected families from that program was consistent with the Federal\nConstitution.[ 2 ] The Free Exercise Clause, which applies to the\nStates under the Fourteenth Amendment, “protects religious\nobservers against unequal treatment” and against “laws that impose\nspecial disabilities on the basis of religious status.” Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 9)\n(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted); see Cantwell v. Connecticut , 310\nU.S. 296 , 303 (1940). Those “basic principle[s ]” have\nlong guided this Court. Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at\n___–___ (slip op., at 6–9). See, e.g. , Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U.S.\n1 , 16 (1947) (a State “cannot exclude individual Catholics,\nLutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers,\nPresbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of\ntheir faith, or lack of it , from receiving the benefits of\npublic welfare legislation”); Lyng v. Northwest Indian\nCemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , 449 (1988) (the Free Exercise Clause protects against laws\nthat “penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal\nshare of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other\ncitizens”). Most recently, Trinity Lutheran distilled\nthese and other decisions to the same effect into the\n“unremarkable” conclusion that disqualifying otherwise eligible\nrecipients from a public benefit “solely because of their religious\ncharacter” imposes “a penalty on the free exercise of religion that\ntriggers the most exacting scrutiny.” 582 U. S., at ___–___\n(slip op., at 9–10). In Trinity Lutheran , Missouri provided\ngrants to help nonprofit organizations pay for playground\nresurfacing, but a state policy disqualified any organization\n“owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 2). Because of that policy, an\notherwise eligible church-owned preschool was denied a grant to\nresurface its playground. Missouri’s policy discriminated against\nthe Church “simply because of what it is—a church,” and so the\npolicy was subject to the “strictest scrutiny,” which it failed. Id. , at ___–___ (slip op., at 11–15). We acknowledged that\nthe State had not “criminalized” the way in which the Church\nworshipped or “told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a\ncertain view of the Gospel.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at 11).\nBut the State’s discriminatory policy was “odious to our\nConstitution all the same.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at\n15). Here too Montana’s no-aid provision bars\nreligious schools from public benefits solely because of the\nreligious character of the schools. The provision also bars parents\nwho wish to send their children to a religious school from those\nsame benefits, again solely because of the religious character of\nthe school. This is apparent from the plain text. The provision\nbars aid to any school “controlled in whole or in part by any\nchurch, sect, or denomination.” Mont. Const., Art. X, §6(1).\nThe provision’s title—“Aid prohibited to sectarian\nschools”—confirms that the provision singles out schools based on\ntheir religious character. Ibid. And the Montana Supreme\nCourt explained that the provision forbids aid to any school that\nis “sectarian,” “religiously affiliated,” or “controlled in whole\nor in part by churches.” 393 Mont., at 464–467, 435 P. 3d, at\n612–613. The provision plainly excludes schools from government aid\nsolely because of religious status. See Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 9–10). The Department counters that Trinity\nLutheran does not govern here because the no-aid provision\napplies not because of the religious character of the recipients,\nbut because of how the funds would be used—for “religious\neducation.” Brief for Respondents 38. In Trinity Lutheran , a\nmajority of the Court concluded that the Missouri policy violated\nthe Free Exercise Clause because it discriminated on the basis of\nreligious status. A plurality declined to address discrimination\nwith respect to “religious uses of funding or other forms of\ndiscrimination.” 582 U. S., at ___, n. 3 (slip op., at 14, n.\n3). The plurality saw no need to consider such concerns because\nMissouri had expressly discriminated “based on religious identity,” ibid. , which was enough to invalidate the state policy\nwithout addressing how government funds were used. This case also turns expressly on religious\nstatus and not religious use. The Montana Supreme Court applied the\nno-aid provision solely by reference to religious status. The Court\nrepeatedly explained that the no-aid provision bars aid to “schools\ncontrolled in whole or in part by churches,” “sectarian schools,”\nand “religiously-affiliated schools.” 393 Mont., at 463–467, 435\nP. 3d, at 611–613. Applying this provision to the scholarship\nprogram, the Montana Supreme Court noted that most of the private\nschools that would benefit from the program were “religiously\naffiliated” and “controlled by churches,” and the Court ultimately\nconcluded that the scholarship program ran afoul of the Montana\nConstitution by aiding “schools controlled by churches.” Id. , at 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 613–614. The Montana\nConstitution discriminates based on religious status just like the\nMissouri policy in Trinity Lutheran , which excluded\norganizations “owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other\nreligious entity.” 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2). The Department points to some language in the\ndecision below indicating that the no-aid provision has the goal or\neffect of ensuring that government aid does not end up being used\nfor “sectarian education” or “religious education.” 393 Mont., at\n460, 466–467, 435 P. 3d, at 609, 613–614. The Department also\ncontrasts what it characterizes as the “completely non-religious”\nbenefit of playground resurfacing in Trinity Lutheran with\nthe unrestricted tuition aid at issue here. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31.\nGeneral school aid, the Department stresses, could be used for\nreligious ends by some recipients, particularly schools that\nbelieve faith should “ permeate [ ]” everything they do.\nBrief for Respondents 39 (quoting State ex rel. Chambers v. School Dist. No. 10 , 155 Mont. 422, 438, 472 P.2d 1013 , 1021 (1970)). See also post , at 8, 13\n(Breyer, J., dissenting). Regardless, those considerations were not the\nMontana Supreme Court’s basis for applying the no-aid provision to\nexclude religious schools; that hinged solely on religious status.\nStatus-based discrimination remains status based even if one of its\ngoals or effects is preventing religious organizations from putting\naid to religious uses. Undeterred by Trinity Lutheran , the\nMontana Supreme Court applied the no-aid provision to hold that\nreligious schools could not benefit from the scholarship program.\n393 Mont., at 464–468, 435 P. 3d, at 612–614. So applied, the\nprovision “impose[s] special disabilities on the basis of religious\nstatus” and “condition[s] the availability of benefits upon a\nrecipient’s willingness to surrender [its] religiously impelled\nstatus.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip\nop., at 9–10) (quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508\nU.S. 520 , 533 (1993), and McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U.S.\n618 , 626 (1978) (plurality opinion) (alterations omitted)). To\nbe eligible for government aid under the Montana Constitution, a\nschool must divorce itself from any religious control or\naffiliation. Placing such a condition on benefits or privileges\n“inevitably deters or discourages the exercise of First Amendment\nrights.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 11) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S.\n398 , 405 (1963) (alterations omitted)). The Free Exercise\nClause protects against even “indirect coercion,” and a State\n“punishe[s] the free exercise of religion” by disqualifying the\nreligious from government aid as Montana did here. Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 10–11)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Such status-based\ndiscrimination is subject to “the strictest scrutiny.” Id. ,\nat ___ (slip op., at 11). None of this is meant to suggest that we agree\nwith the Department, Brief for Respondents 36–40, that some lesser\ndegree of scrutiny applies to discrimination against religious uses\nof government aid. See Lukumi , 508 U. S., at 546\n(striking down law designed to ban religious practice involving\nalleged animal cruelty, explaining that a law “target[ing]\nreligious conduct for distinctive treatment or advanc[ing]\nlegitimate governmental interests only against conduct with a\nreligious motivation will survive strict scrutiny only in rare\ncases”). Some Members of the Court, moreover, have questioned\nwhether there is a meaningful distinction between discrimination\nbased on use or conduct and that based on status. See Trinity\nLutheran , 582 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 1–2)\n(Gorsuch, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in part) (citing, e.g. , Lukumi , 508 U.S.\n520 , and Thomas v. Review Bd. of Ind. Employment\nSecurity Div. , 450 U.S.\n707 (1981)). We acknowledge the point but need not examine it\nhere. It is enough in this case to conclude that strict scrutiny\napplies under Trinity Lutheran because Montana’s no-aid\nprovision discriminates based on religious status. B Seeking to avoid Trinity Lutheran , the\nDepartment contends that this case is instead governed by Locke v. Davey , 540 U.S.\n712 (2004). See also post , at 5 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting); post , at 9 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Locke also involved a scholarship program. The State of\nWashington provided scholarships paid out of the State’s general\nfund to help students pursuing postsecondary education. The\nscholarships could be used at accredited religious and nonreligious\nschools alike, but Washington prohibited students from using the\nscholarships to pursue devotional theology degrees, which prepared\nstudents for a calling as clergy. This prohibition prevented Davey\nfrom using his scholarship to obtain a degree that would have\nenabled him to become a pastor. We held that Washington had not\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause. Locke differs from this case in two\ncritical ways. First, Locke explained that Washington had\n“merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction”: the\n“essentially religious endeavor” of training a minister “to lead a\ncongregation.” Id. , at 721. Thus, Davey “was denied a\nscholarship because of what he proposed to do —use the funds\nto prepare for the ministry.” Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). Apart from that narrow\nrestriction, Washington’s program allowed scholarships to be used\nat “pervasively religious schools” that incorporated religious\ninstruction throughout their classes. Locke , 540 U. S.,\nat 724–725. By contrast, Montana’s Constitution does not zero in on\nany particular “essentially religious” course of instruction at a\nreligious school. Rather, as we have explained, the no-aid\nprovision bars all aid to a religious school “simply because of\nwhat it is,” putting the school to a choice between being religious\nor receiving government benefits. Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). At the same time, the\nprovision puts families to a choice between sending their children\nto a religious school or receiving such benefits. Second, Locke invoked a “historic and\nsubstantial” state interest in not funding the training of clergy,\n540 U. S., at 725, explaining that “opposition to\n. . . funding ‘to support church leaders’ lay at the\nhistoric core of the Religion Clauses,” Trinity Lutheran ,\n582 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (quoting Locke , 540\nU. S., at 722). As evidence of that tradition, the Court in Locke emphasized that the propriety of state-supported\nclergy was a central subject of founding-era debates, and that most\nstate constitutions from that era prohibited the expenditure of tax\ndollars to support the clergy. See id. , at 722–723. But no comparable “historic and substantial”\ntradition supports Montana’s decision to disqualify religious\nschools from government aid. In the founding era and the early 19th\ncentury, governments provided financial support to private schools,\nincluding denominational ones. “Far from prohibiting such support,\nthe early state constitutions and statutes actively encouraged this\npolicy.” L. Jorgenson, The State and the Non-Public School,\n1825–1925, p. 4 (1987); e.g., R. Gabel, Public Funds for\nChurch and Private Schools 210, 217–218, 221, 241–243 (1937); C.\nKaestle, Pillars of the Republic: Common Schools and American\nSociety, 1760–1860, pp. 166–167 (1983). Local governments provided\ngrants to private schools, including religious ones, for the\neducation of the poor. M. McConnell, et al., Religion and the\nConstitution 318–319 (4th ed. 2016). Even States with bans on\ngovernment-supported clergy, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\nGeorgia, provided various forms of aid to religious schools.\n See Kaestle, supra , at 166–167; Gabel, supra ,\nat 215–218, 241–245, 372–374; cf. Locke , 540 U. S., at\n723. Early federal aid (often land grants) went to religious\nschools. McConnell, supra , at 319. Congress provided support\nto denominational schools in the District of Columbia until 1848, ibid. , and Congress paid churches to run schools for\nAmerican Indians through the end of the 19th century, see Quick\nBear v. Leupp , 210 U.S.\n50 , 78 (1908); Gabel, supra , at 521–523. After the Civil\nWar, Congress spent large sums on education for emancipated\nfreedmen, often by supporting denominational schools in the South\nthrough the Freedmen’s Bureau. McConnell, supra , at\n323.[ 3 ] The Department argues that a tradition against state support for religious schools arose in the\nsecond half of the 19th century, as more than 30 States—including\nMontana—adopted no-aid provisions. See Brief for Respondents 40–42\nand App. D. Such a development, of course, cannot by itself\nestablish an early American tradition. Justice Sotomayor questions\nour reliance on aid provided during the same era by the Freedmen’s\nBureau, post , at 10 (dissenting opinion), but we see no\ninconsistency in recognizing that such evidence may reinforce an\nearly practice but cannot create one. In addition, many of the\nno-aid provisions belong to a more checkered tradition shared with\nthe Blaine Amendment of the 1870s. That proposal—which Congress\nnearly passed—would have added to the Federal Constitution a\nprovision similar to the state no-aid provisions, prohibiting\n",

COOLEY certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit No. 19–1414. Argued March 23, 2021—Decided\nJune 1, 2021 Late one night Officer James Saylor of the\nCrow Police Department approached a truck parked on United States\nHighway 212, a public right-of-way within the Crow Reservation in\nthe State of Montana. Saylor spoke to the driver, Joshua James\nCooley, and observed that Cooley appeared to be non-native and had\nwatery, bloodshot eyes. Saylor also noticed two semiautomatic\nrifles lying on Cooley’s front seat. Fearing violence, Saylor\nordered Cooley out of the truck and conducted a patdown search.\nSaylor also saw in the truck a glass pipe and a plastic bag that\ncontained methamphetamine. Additional officers, including an\nofficer with the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, arrived on the\nscene in response to Saylor’s call for assistance. Saylor was\ndirected to seize all contraband in plain view, leading Saylor to\ndiscover more methamphetamine. Saylor took Cooley to the Crow\nPolice Department where federal and local officers further\nquestioned Cooley. Subsequently, a federal grand jury indicted\nCooley on drug and gun offenses. The District Court granted\nCooley’s motion to suppress the drug evidence. The Ninth Circuit\naffirmed. It reasoned that a tribal police officer could stop (and\nhold for a reasonable time) a non-Indian suspect if the officer\nfirst tries to determine whether the suspect is non-Indian and, in\nthe course of doing so, finds an apparent violation of state or\nfederal law. The Ninth Circuit concluded that Saylor had failed to\nmake that initial determination here. Held : A tribal police officer has\nauthority to detain temporarily and to search non-Indian persons\ntraveling on public rights-of-way running through a reservation for\npotential violations of state or federal law. Pp. 3–9. (a) As a “general proposition,” the\n“inherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the\nactivities of nonmembers of the tribe.” Montana v. United\nStates , 450 U.S.\n544 , 565. The Court identified in Montana two exceptions\nto that general rule, the second of which fits almost like a glove\nhere: A tribe retains inherent authority over the conduct of\nnon-Indians on the reservation “when that conduct threatens or has\nsome direct effect on . . . the health or welfare of the tribe.” Id. , at 566. The conclusion that Saylor’s actions here fall\nwithin Montana ’s second exception is consistent with the\nCourt’s prior Montana cases. See Strate v. A–1\nContractors , 520 U.S.\n438 , 456 n. 11; see also Atkinson Trading Co. v. Shirley , 532 U.S.\n645 , 651. Similarly, the Court has held that when the\n“jurisdiction to try and punish an offender rests outside the\ntribe, tribal officers may exercise their power to detain the\noffender and transport him to the proper authorities.” Duro v. Reina , 495 U.S.\n676 , 697. Ancillary to the authority to transport a non-Indian\nsuspect is the authority to search that individual prior to\ntransport, as several state courts and other federal courts have\nheld. While that authority has sometimes been traced to a tribe’s\nright to exclude non-Indians, tribes “have inherent sovereignty\nindependent of th[e] authority arising from their power to\nexclude,” Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of\nYakima Nation , 492 U.S.\n408 , 425 (plurality opinion), and here Montana ’s second\nexception recognizes that inherent authority. In addition,\nrecognizing a tribal officer’s authority to investigate potential\nviolations of state or federal laws that apply to non-Indians\nwhether outside a reservation or on a public right-of-way within\nthe reservation protects public safety without implicating the\nconcerns about applying tribal laws to non-Indians noted in the\nCourt’s prior cases. Finally, the Court doubts the workability of\nthe Ninth Circuit’s standards, which would require tribal officers\nfirst to determine whether a suspect is non-Indian and, if so, to\ntemporarily detain a non-Indian only for “apparent” legal\nviolations. 919 F.3d 1135, 1142. The first requirement produces an\nincentive to lie. The second requirement introduces a new standard\ninto search and seizure law and creates a problem of interpretation\nthat will arise frequently given the prevalence of non-Indians in\nIndian reservations. Pp. 3–7. (b) Cooley’s arguments against\nrecognition of inherent tribal sovereignty here are unpersuasive.\nWhile the Court agrees the Montana exceptions should not be\ninterpreted so as to “ ‘swallow the rule,’ ” Plains Commerce\nBank v. Long Family Land & Cattle Co. , 554 U.S.\n316 , 330, this case does not raise that concern due to the\nclose fit between Montana ’s second exception and the facts\nhere. In addition, the Court sees nothing in existing federal\ncross-deputization statutes that suggests Congress has sought to\ndeny tribes the authority at issue. To the contrary, existing\nlegislation and executive action appear to operate on the\nassumption that tribes have retained this authority. Pp. 8–9. 919 F.3d 1135, vacated and remanded. Breyer, J., delivered the opinion for a\nunanimous Court. Alito, J., filed a concurring opinion. NOTICE: This opinion is subject to\nformal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the\nUnited States Reports. Readers are requested to notify the Reporter\nof Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington,\nD. C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in\norder that corrections may be made before the preliminary print\ngoes to press. SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 19–1414 _________________ UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. JOSHUA\nJAMES COOLEY on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit [June 1, 2021] Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. The question presented is whether an Indian\ntribe’s police officer has authority to detain temporarily and to\nsearch a non-Indian on a public right-of-way that runs through an\nIndian reservation. The search and detention, we assume, took place\nbased on a potential violation of state or federal law prior to the\nsuspect’s transport to the proper nontribal authorities for\nprosecution. We have previously noted that a tribe retains\ninherent sovereign authority to address “conduct [that] threatens\nor has some direct effect on . . . the health or welfare\nof the tribe.” Montana v. United States , 450\nU.S. 544 , 566 (1981); see also Strate v. A–1\nContractors , 520\nU.S. 438 , 456, n. 11 (1997). We believe this statement of law\ngoverns here. And we hold the tribal officer possesses the\nauthority at issue. I Late at night in February 2016, Officer James\nSaylor of the Crow Police Department was driving east on United\nStates Highway 212, a public right-of-way within the Crow\nReservation, located within the State of Montana. Saylor saw a\ntruck parked on the westbound side of the highway. Believing the\noccupants might need assistance, Saylor approached the truck and\nspoke to the driver, Joshua James Cooley. Saylor noticed that\nCooley had “watery, bloodshot eyes” and “appeared to be\nnon-native.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a. Saylor also noticed two\nsemiautomatic rifles lying on the front seat. Eventually fearing\nviolence, Saylor ordered Cooley out of the truck and conducted a\npatdown search. He called tribal and county officers for\nassistance. While waiting for the officers to arrive, Saylor\nreturned to the truck. He saw a glass pipe and plastic bag that\ncontained methamphetamine. The other officers, including an officer\nwith the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, then arrived. They\ndirected Saylor to seize all contraband in plain view, leading him\nto discover more methamphetamine. Saylor took Cooley to the Crow\nPolice Department where federal and local officers further\nquestioned Cooley. In April 2016, a federal grand jury indicted\nCooley on drug and gun offenses. See 21 U. S. C.\n§841(a)(1); 18 U. S. C. §924(c)(1)(A). The District Court\ngranted Cooley’s motion to suppress the drug evidence that Saylor\nhad seized. It reasoned that Saylor, as a Crow Tribe police\nofficer, lacked the authority to investigate nonapparent violations\nof state or federal law by a non-Indian on a public right-of-way\ncrossing the reservation. The Government appealed. See 18\nU. S. C. §3731. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt’s evidence- suppression determination. The Ninth Circuit\npanel wrote that tribes “cannot exclude non-Indians from a state or\nfederal highway” and “lack the ancillary power to investigate\nnon-Indians who are using such public rights-of-way.” 919 F.3d\n1135, 1141 (2019). It added that a tribal police officer\nnonetheless could stop (and hold for a reasonable time) a\nnon-Indian suspect, but only if (1) the officer first tried to\ndetermine whether “the person is an Indian,” and, if the person\nturns out to be a non-Indian, (2) it is “apparent” that the person\nhas violated state or federal law. Id. , at 1142. Non-Indian\nstatus, the panel added, can usually be determined by “ask[ing] one\nquestion.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). Because\nSaylor had not initially tried to determine whether Cooley was an\nIndian, the panel held that the lower court correctly suppressed\nthe evidence. The Ninth Circuit denied the Government’s\nrequest for rehearing en banc. We then granted the Government’s\npetition for certiorari in order to decide whether a tribal police\nofficer has authority to detain temporarily and to search\nnon-Indians traveling on public rights-of-way running through a\nreservation for potential violations of state or federal law. II Long ago we described Indian tribes as\n“distinct, independent political communities” exercising sovereign\nauthority. Worcester v. Georgia , 6 Pet. 515, 559\n(1832). Due to their incorporation into the United States, however,\nthe “sovereignty that the Indian tribes retain is of a unique and\nlimited character.” United States v. Wheeler , 435 U.S.\n313 , 323 (1978). Indian tribes may, for example, determine\ntribal membership, regulate domestic affairs among tribal members,\nand exclude others from entering tribal land. See, e.g., Plains Commerce Bank v. Long Family Land & Cattle\nCo. , 554 U.S.\n316 , 327–328 (2008). On the other hand, owing to their\n“dependent status,” tribes lack any “freedom independently to\ndetermine their external relations” and cannot, for instance,\n“enter into direct commercial or governmental relations with\nforeign nations.” Wheeler , 435 U. S., at 326. Tribes\nalso lack inherent sovereign power to exercise criminal\njurisdiction over non- Indians. See Oliphant v. Suquamish\nTribe , 435 U.S.\n191 , 212 (1978). In all cases, tribal authority remains subject\nto the plenary authority of Congress. See, e.g., Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community , 572 U.S.\n782 , 788 (2014). Here, no treaty or statute has explicitly\ndivested Indian tribes of the policing authority at issue. We turn\nto precedent to determine whether a tribe has retained inherent\nsovereign authority to exercise that power. In answering this\nquestion, our decision in Montana v. United States , 450 U.S.\n544 (1981), is highly relevant. In that case we asked whether a\ntribe could regulate hunting and fishing by non-Indians on land\nthat non-Indians owned in fee simple on a reservation. We held that\nit could not. We supported our conclusion by referring to our\nholding in Oliphant that a tribe could not “exercise\ncriminal jurisdiction over non- Indians.” Montana , 450\nU. S., at 565. We then wrote that the “principles on which\n[ Oliphant ] relied support the general proposition that the\ninherent sovereign powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the\nactivities of nonmembers of the tribe.” Ibid. At the same time, we made clear that Montana ’s “general proposition” was not an absolute rule. Ibid. We set forth two important exceptions. First ,\nwe said that a “tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or\nother means, the activities of nonmembers who enter consensual\nrelationships with the tribe or its members, through commercial\ndealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements.” Ibid. Second , we said that a “tribe may also retain inherent power\nto exercise civil authority over the conduct of non-Indians on fee\nlands within its reservation when that conduct threatens or has\nsome direct effect on the political integrity, the economic\nsecurity, or the health or welfare of the tribe. ” Id. ,\nat 566 (emphasis added). The second exception we have just quoted fits\nthe present case, almost like a glove. The phrase speaks of the\nprotection of the “health or welfare of the tribe.” To deny a\ntribal police officer authority to search and detain for a\nreasonable time any person he or she believes may commit or has\ncommitted a crime would make it difficult for tribes to protect\nthemselves against ongoing threats. Such threats may be posed by,\nfor instance, non-Indian drunk drivers, transporters of contraband,\nor other criminal offenders operating on roads within the\nboundaries of a tribal reservation. As the Washington Supreme Court\nhas noted, “[a]llowing a known drunk driver to get back in his or\nher car, careen off down the road, and possibly kill or injure\nIndians or non-Indians would certainly be detrimental to the health\nor welfare of the Tribe.” State v. Schmuck , 121 Wash. 2d 373 , 391, 850 P.2d 1332 , 1341, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 931 (1993). We have subsequently repeated Montana ’s\nproposition and exceptions in several cases involving a tribe’s\njurisdiction over the activities of non-Indians within the\nreservation. See, e.g., Plains Commerce Bank , 554\nU. S., at 328–330; Nevada v. Hicks , 533 U.S.\n353 , 358–360, and n. 3 (2001); South Dakota v. Bourland , 508 U.S.\n679 , 694–696 (1993); Duro v. Reina , 495 U.S.\n676 , 687–688 (1990); Brendale v. Confederated Tribes\nand Bands of Yakima Nation , 492 U.S.\n408 , 426–430 (1989) (plurality opinion). In doing so we have\nreserved a tribe’s inherent sovereign authority to engage in\npolicing of the kind before us. Most notably, in Strate v. A–1 Contractors , 520\nU.S. 438 , 456–459 (1997), we relied upon Montana’s general jurisdiction-limiting principle to hold that tribal courts\ndid not retain inherent authority to adjudicate personal-injury\nactions against nonmembers of the tribe based upon automobile\naccidents that took place on public rights-of-way running through a\nreservation. But we also said: “We do not here question the authority of\ntribal police to patrol roads within a reservation, including\nrights-of-way made part of a state highway, and to detain and turn\nover to state officers nonmembers stopped on the highway for\nconduct violating state law. Cf. State v. Schmuck , 121 Wash. 2d 373 , 390, 850 P.2d 1332 , 1341 (en banc) (recognizing that a limited\ntribal power ‘to stop and detain alleged offenders in no way\nconfers an unlimited authority to regulate the right of the\npublic to travel on the Reservation’s roads’), cert. denied, 510\nU.S. 931 (1993).” 520 U. S., at 456, n. 11. We reiterated this point in Atkinson Trading\nCo. v. Shirley , 532 U.S.\n645 , 651 (2001), there confirming that Strate “did not\nquestion the ability of tribal police to patrol the highway.” Similarly, we recognized in Duro that\n“[w]here jurisdiction to try and punish an offender rests outside\nthe tribe, tribal officers may exercise their power to detain the\noffender and transport him to the proper authorities.” 495\nU. S., at 697. The authority to search a non-Indian prior to\ntransport is ancillary to this authority that we have already\nrecognized. Cf. Ortiz-Barraza v. United States , 512\nF.2d 1176, 1180–1181 (CA9 1975). Indeed, several state courts and\nother federal courts have held that tribal officers possess the\nauthority at issue here. See, e.g., Schmuck , 121\nWash. 2d, at 390, 850 P. 2d, at 1341; State v. Pamperien , 156 Ore. App. 153, 155–159, 967 P.2d 503, 504–506\n(1998); State v. Ryder , 98 N. M. 453, 456, 649 P.2d 756 , 759 (1982); see also United States v. Terry , 400 F.3d 575 , 579–580 (CA8 2005); Ortiz-Barraza , 512\nF. 2d, at 1180–1181; see generally F. Cohen, Handbook of\nFederal Indian Law §9.07, p. 773 (2012). To be sure, in Duro we traced the relevant tribal authority to a tribe’s right to\nexclude non-Indians from reservation land. See 495 U. S., at\n696–697. But tribes “have inherent sovereignty independent of th[e]\nauthority arising from their power to exclude,” Brendale ,\n492 U. S., at 425 (plurality opinion), and here Montana ’s second exception recognizes that inherent\nauthority. We also note that our prior cases denying tribal\njurisdiction over the activities of non-Indians on a reservation\nhave rested in part upon the fact that full tribal jurisdiction\nwould require the application of tribal laws to non-Indians who do\nnot belong to the tribe and consequently had no say in creating the\nlaws that would be applied to them. See Duro , 495\nU. S., at 693 (noting the concern that tribal-court criminal\njurisdiction over nonmembers would subject such defendants to\n“trial by political bodies that do not include them”); Plains\nCommerce Bank , 554 U. S., at 337 (noting that nonmembers\n“have no part in tribal government” and have “no say in the laws\nand regulations that govern tribal territory”). Saylor’s search and\ndetention, however, do not subsequently subject Cooley to tribal\nlaw, but rather only to state and federal laws that apply whether\nan individual is outside a reservation or on a state or federal\nhighway within it. As the Solicitor General points out, an initial\ninvestigation of non-Indians’ “violations of federal and state laws\nto which those non-Indians are indisputably subject” protects the\npublic without raising “similar concerns” of the sort raised in our\ncases limiting tribal authority. Brief for United States 24–25. Finally, we have doubts about the workability of\nthe standards that the Ninth Circuit set out. Those standards\nrequire tribal officers first to determine whether a suspect is\nnon-Indian and, if so, allow temporary detention only if the\nviolation of law is “apparent.” 919 F. 3d, at 1142. The first\nrequirement, even if limited to asking a single question, would\nproduce an incentive to lie. The second requirement—that the\nviolation of law be “apparent”—introduces a new standard into\nsearch and seizure law. Whether, or how, that standard would be met\nis not obvious. At the same time, because most of those who live on\nIndian reservations are non-Indians, this problem of interpretation\ncould arise frequently. See, e.g., Brief for Former United\nStates Attorneys as Amici Curiae 24 (noting that 3.5 million\nof the 4.6 million people living in American Indian areas in the\n2010 census were non-Indians); Brief for National Indigenous\nWomen’s Resource Center et al. as Amici Curiae 19–20\n(noting that more than 70% of residents on several reservations are\nnon-Indian). III In response, Cooley cautions against\n“inappropriately expand[ing] the second Montana exception.”\nBrief for Respondent 24–25 (citing Atkinson , 532 U. S.,\nat 657, n. 12, and Strate , 520 U. S., at 457–458).\nWe have previously warned that the Montana exceptions are\n“limited” and “cannot be construed in a manner that would swallow\nthe rule.” Plains Commerce Bank , 554 U. S., at 330\n(internal quotation marks omitted). But we have also repeatedly\nacknowledged the existence of the exceptions and preserved the\npossibility that “certain forms of nonmember behavior” may\n“sufficiently affect the tribe as to justify tribal oversight.” Id. , at 335. Given the close fit between the second\nexception and the circumstances here, we do not believe the\nwarnings can control the outcome. Cooley adds that federal cross-deputization\nstatutes already grant many Indian tribes a degree of authority to\nenforce federal law. See Brief for Respondent 28–30; see generally\n25 U. S. C. §§2803(5), (7) (Secretary of the Interior may\nauthorize tribal officers to “make inquiries of any person” related\nto the “carrying out in Indian country” of federal law and to\n“perform any other law enforcement related duty”); §2805 (Secretary\nof the Interior may promulgate rules “relating to the enforcement\nof ” federal criminal law in Indian country); 25 CFR §12.21\n(2019) (Bureau of Indian Affairs may “issue law enforcement\ncommissions” to tribal police officers “to obtain active\nassistance” in enforcing federal criminal law). Because Congress\nhas specified the scope of tribal police activity through these\nstatutes, Cooley argues, the Court must not interpret tribal\nsovereignty to fill any remaining gaps in policing authority. See\nBrief for Respondent 12. We are not convinced by this argument. The\nstatutory and regulatory provisions to which Cooley refers do not\neasily fit the present circumstances. They are overinclusive, for\ninstance encompassing the authority to arrest. See §2803(3). And\nthey are also underinclusive. Because these provisions do not\ngovern violations of state law, tribes would still need to strike\nagreements with a variety of other authorities to ensure complete\ncoverage. See Brief for Cayuga Nation et al. as Amici\nCuriae 7–8, 25–27. More broadly, cross-deputization agreements\nare difficult to reach, and they often require negotiation between\nother authorities and the tribes over such matters as training,\nreciprocal authority to arrest, the “geographical reach of the\nagreements, the jurisdiction of the parties, liability of officers\nperforming under the agreements, and sovereign immunity.” Fletcher,\nFort, & Singel, Indian Country Law Enforcement and Cooperative\nPublic Safety Agreements, 89 Mich. Bar J. 42, 44 (2010). In short, we see nothing in these provisions\nthat shows that Congress sought to deny tribes the authority at\nissue, authority that rests upon a tribe’s retention of sovereignty\nas interpreted by Montana, and in particular its second\nexception. To the contrary, in our view, existing legislation and\nexecutive action appear to operate on the assumption that tribes\nhave retained this authority. See, e.g., Brief for Current\nand Former Members of Congress as Amici Curiae 23–25; Brief\nfor Former U. S. Attorneys as Amici Curiae 28–29. *  *  * For these reasons, we vacate the Ninth\nCircuit’s judgment and remand the case for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.",

MAKIN certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the first circuit No. 20–1088. Argued December 8, 2021—Decided\nJune 21, 2022 Maine has enacted a program of tuition\nassistance for parents who live in school districts that neither\noperate a secondary school of their own nor contract with a\nparticular school in another district. Under that program, parents\ndesignate the secondary school they would like their child to\nattend, and the school district transmits payments to that school\nto help defray the costs of tuition. Participating private schools\nmust meet certain requirements to be eligible to receive tuition\npayments, including either accreditation from the New England\nAssociation of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) or approval from the\nMaine Department of Education. But they may otherwise differ from\nMaine public schools in various ways. Since 1981, however, Maine\nhas limited tuition assistance payments to “nonsectarian”\nschools. Petitioners sought tuition assistance to send\ntheir children to Bangor Christian Schools (BCS) and Temple\nAcademy. Although both BCS and Temple Academy are accredited by\nNEASC, the schools do not qualify as “nonsectarian” and are thus\nineligible to receive tuition payments under Maine’s tuition\nassistance program. Petitioners sued the commissioner of the Maine\nDepartment of Education, alleging that the “nonsectarian”\nrequirement violated the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment\nClause of the First Amendment, as well as the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court rejected\npetitioners’ constitutional claims and granted judgment to the\ncommissioner. The First Circuit affirmed. Held : Maine’s “nonsectarian”\nrequirement for otherwise generally available tuition assistance\npayments violates the Free Exercise Clause. Pp. 6–18. (a) The Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment protects against “indirect coercion or penalties on the\nfree exercise of religion, not just outright prohibitions.” Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn ., 485 U.S.\n439 , 450. The Court recently applied this principle in the\ncontext of two state efforts to withhold otherwise available public\nbenefits from religious organizations. In Trinity Lutheran\nChurch of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U. S. ___,\nthe Court considered a Missouri program that offered grants to\nqualifying nonprofit organizations that installed cushioning\nplayground surfaces, but denied such grants to any applicant that\nwas owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious\nentity. The Court held that the Free Exercise Clause did not permit\nMissouri to “expressly discriminate[ ] against otherwise\neligible recipients by disqualifying them from a public benefit\nsolely because of their religious character.” 582 U. S., at\n___–___. And in Espinoza v. Montana Department of\nRevenue , 591 U. S. ___, the Court held that a provision of\nthe Montana Constitution barring government aid to any school\n“controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect, or\ndenomination” violated the Free Exercise Clause by prohibiting\nfamilies from using otherwise available scholarship funds at\nreligious schools. 591 U. S., at ___. “A State need not\nsubsidize private education,” the Court concluded, “[b]ut once a\nState decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools\nsolely because they are religious.” Id., at ___.\nPp. 6–8. (b) The principles applied in Trinity\nLutheran and Espinoza suffice to resolve this case.\nMaine offers its citizens a benefit: tuition assistance payments\nfor any family whose school district does not provide a public\nsecondary school. Just like the wide range of nonprofit\norganizations eligible to receive playground resurfacing grants in Trinity Lutheran , a wide range of private schools are\neligible to receive Maine tuition assistance payments here. And\nlike the daycare center in Trinity Lutheran , the religious\nschools in this case are disqualified from this generally available\nbenefit “solely because of their religious character.” 582\nU. S., at ___. Likewise, in Espinoza , as here, the\nCourt considered a state benefit program that provided public funds\nto support tuition payments at private schools and specifically\ncarved out private religious schools from those eligible to receive\nsuch funds. Both that program and this one disqualify certain\nprivate schools from public funding “solely because they are\nreligious.” 591 U. S., at ___. A law that operates in that\nmanner must be subjected to “the strictest scrutiny.” Id. ,\nat ___–___. Maine’s program cannot survive strict\nscrutiny. A neutral benefit program in which public funds flow to\nreligious organizations through the independent choices of private\nbenefit recipients does not offend the Establishment Clause. See Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , 536\nU.S. 639 , 652–653. Maine’s decision to continue excluding\nreligious schools from its tuition assistance program after Zelman thus promotes stricter separation of church and state\nthan the Federal Constitution requires. But a State’s\nantiestablishment interest does not justify enactments that exclude\nsome members of the community from an otherwise generally available\npublic benefit because of their religious exercise.\nPp. 9–11. (c) The First Circuit’s attempts to\nrecharacterize the nature of Maine’s tuition assistance program do\nnot suffice to distinguish this case from Trinity Lutheran or Espinoza. Pp. 11–18. (1) The First Circuit held that the\n“nonsectarian” requirement was constitutional because the benefit\nwas properly viewed not as tuition payments to be used at approved\nprivate schools but instead as funding for the “rough equivalent of\nthe public school education that Maine may permissibly require to\nbe secular.” 979 F.3d 21, 44. But the statute does not say anything\nlike that. The benefit provided by statute is tuition at a public\nor private school, selected by the parent, with no suggestion that\nthe “private school” must somehow provide a “public” education.\nMoreover, the differences between private schools eligible to\nreceive tuition assistance under Maine’s program and a Maine public\nschool are numerous and important. To start with, private schools\ndo not have to accept all students, while public schools generally\ndo. In addition, the free public education that Maine insists it is\nproviding through the tuition assistance program is often not free,\nas some participating private schools charge several times the\nmaximum benefit that Maine is willing to provide. And the\ncurriculum taught at participating private schools need not even\nresemble that taught in the Maine public schools. The key manner in which participating private\nschools are required to resemble Maine public schools,\nhowever, is that they must be secular. Maine may provide a strictly\nsecular education in its public schools. But BCS and Temple\nAcademy—like numerous other recipients of Maine tuition assistance\npayments—are not public schools. Maine has chosen to offer tuition\nassistance that parents may direct to the public or private schools\nof their choice. Maine’s administration of that benefit is\nsubject to the free exercise principles governing any public\nbenefit program—including the prohibition on denying the benefit\nbased on a recipient’s religious exercise. Pp. 11–15. (2) The Court of Appeals also attempted\nto distinguish this case from Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza on the ground that the funding restrictions in\nthose cases were “solely status-based religious discrimination,”\nwhile the challenged provision here “imposes a use-based\nrestriction.” 979 F. 3d, at 35, 37–38. Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza held that the Free Exercise Clause forbids\ndiscrimination on the basis of religious status. But those\ndecisions never suggested that use-based discrimination is any less\noffensive to the Free Exercise Clause. This case illustrates why.\n“[E]ducating young people in their faith, inculcating its\nteachings, and training them to live their faith are\nresponsibilities that lie at the very core of the mission of a\nprivate religious school.” Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru , 591 U. S. ___, ___. In short, the\nprohibition on status-based discrimination under the Free Exercise\nClause is not a permission to engage in use-based\ndiscrimination. Locke v. Davey , 540 U.S.\n712 , does not assist Maine here. The scholarship funds at issue\nin Locke were intended to be used “to prepare for the\nministry.” Trinity Lutheran , 582 U. S., at ___. Locke ’s reasoning expressly turned on what it identified as\nthe “historic and substantial state interest” against using\n“taxpayer funds to support church leaders.” 540 U. S., at 722,\n725. But “it is clear that there is no ‘historic and substantial’\ntradition against aiding [private religious] schools” that is\n“comparable.” Espinoza , 591 U. S., at ___. Locke cannot be read to generally authorize the State to exclude\nreligious persons from the enjoyment of public benefits on the\nbasis of their anticipated religious use of the benefits.\nPp. 15–18. 979 F.3d 21, reversed and remanded. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, in which Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett,\nJJ., joined. Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Kagan\nJ., joined, and in which Sotomayor, J., joined as to all but Part\nI–B. Sotomayor, J., filed a dissenting opinion.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 20–1088 _________________ DAVID CARSON, as parent and next friend of O.\nC., et al., PETITIONERS v. A. PENDER MAKIN on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the first circuit [June 21, 2022] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. Maine has enacted a program of tuition\nassistance for parents who live in school districts that do not\noperate a secondary school of their own. Under the program, parents\ndesignate the secondary school they would like their child to\nattend—public or private—and the school district transmits payments\nto that school to help defray the costs of tuition. Most private\nschools are eligible to receive the payments, so long as they are\n“nonsectarian.” The question presented is whether this restriction\nviolates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. I A Maine’s Constitution provides that the State’s\nlegislature shall “require . . . the several towns to\nmake suitable provision, at their own expense, for the support and\nmaintenance of public schools.” Me. Const., Art. VIII, pt. 1, §1.\nIn accordance with that command, the legislature has required that\nevery school-age child in Maine “shall be provided an opportunity\nto receive the benefits of a free public education,” Me. Rev. Stat.\nAnn., Tit. 20–A, §2(1) (2008), and that the required schools be\noperated by “the legislative and governing bodies of local school\nadministrative units,” §2(2). But Maine is the most rural State in\nthe Union, and for many school districts the realities of remote\ngeography and low population density make those commands difficult\nto heed. Indeed, of Maine’s 260 school administrative units (SAUs),\nfewer than half operate a public secondary school of their own.\nApp. 4, 70, 73. Maine has sought to deal with this problem in\npart by creating a program of tuition assistance for families that\nreside in such areas. Under that program, if an SAU neither\noperates its own public secondary school nor contracts with a\nparticular public or private school for the education of its\nschool-age children, the SAU must “pay the tuition . . .\nat the public school or the approved private school of the parent’s\nchoice at which the student is accepted.” Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit.\n20–A, §5204(4) (Cum. Supp. 2021). Parents who wish to take\nadvantage of this benefit first select the school they wish their\nchild to attend. Ibid. If they select a private school that\nhas been “approved” by the Maine Department of Education, the\nparents’ SAU “shall pay the tuition” at the chosen school up to a\nspecified maximum rate. See §§2902, 2951, 5204(4). To be “approved” to receive these payments, a\nprivate school must meet certain basic requirements under Maine’s\ncompulsory education law. §2951(1). The school must either be\n“[c]urrently accredited by a New England association of schools and\ncolleges” or separately “approv[ed] for attendance purposes” by the\nDepartment. §§2901(2), 2902. Schools seeking approval from the\nDepartment must meet specified curricular requirements, such as\nusing English as the language of instruction, offering a course in\n“Maine history, including the Constitution of Maine . . .\nand Maine’s cultural and ethnic heritage,” and maintaining a\nstudent-teacher ratio of not more than 30 to 1. §§2902(2), 2902(3),\n4706(2), 2902(6)(C). The program imposes no geographic limitation:\nParents may direct tuition payments to schools inside or outside\nthe State, or even in foreign countries. §§2951(3), 5808. In\nschools that qualify for the program because they are accredited,\nteachers need not be certified by the State, §13003(3), and Maine’s\ncurricular requirements do not apply, §2901(2). Single-sex schools\nare eligible. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, §4553(2–A)\n(exempting single-sex private, but not public, schools from Maine’s\nantidiscrimination law). Prior to 1981, parents could also direct the\ntuition assistance payments to religious schools. Indeed, in the\n1979–1980 school year, over 200 Maine students opted to attend such\nschools through the tuition assistance program. App. 72. In 1981,\nhowever, Maine imposed a new requirement that any school receiving\ntuition assistance payments must be “a nonsectarian school in\naccordance with the First Amendment of the United States\nConstitution.” Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 20–A, §2951(2). That\nprovision was enacted in response to an opinion by the Maine\nattorney general taking the position that public funding of private\nreligious schools violated the Establishment Clause of the First\nAmendment. We subsequently held, however, that a benefit program\nunder which private citizens “direct government aid to religious\nschools wholly as a result of their own genuine and independent\nprivate choice” does not offend the Establishment Clause. Zelman v. Simmons-Harris , 536\nU.S. 639 , 652 (2002). Following our decision in Zelman ,\nthe Maine Legislature considered a proposed bill to repeal the\n“nonsectarian” requirement, but rejected it. App. 100, 108. The “nonsectarian” requirement for participation\nin Maine’s tuition assistance program remains in effect today. The\nDepartment has stated that, in administering this requirement, it\n“considers a sectarian school to be one that is associated with a\nparticular faith or belief system and which, in addition to\nteaching academic subjects, promotes the faith or belief system\nwith which it is associated and/or presents the material taught\nthrough the lens of this faith.” 979 F.3d 21, 38 (CA1 2020). “The\nDepartment’s focus is on what the school teaches through its\ncurriculum and related activities, and how the material is\npresented.” Ibid. (emphasis deleted). “[A]ffiliation or\nassociation with a church or religious institution is one potential\nindicator of a sectarian school,” but “it is not dispositive.” Ibid . B This case concerns two families that live in\nSAUs that neither maintain their own secondary schools nor contract\nwith any nearby secondary school. App. 70, 71. Petitioners David\nand Amy Carson reside in Glenburn, Maine. Id. , at 74. When\nthis litigation commenced, the Carsons’ daughter attended high\nschool at Bangor Christian Schools (BCS), which was founded in 1970\nas a ministry of Bangor Baptist Church. Id. , at 74, 80. The\nCarsons sent their daughter to BCS because of the school’s high\nacademic standards and because the school’s Christian worldview\naligns with their sincerely held religious beliefs. Id. , at\n74. Given that BCS is a “sectarian” school that cannot qualify for\ntuition assistance payments under Maine’s program, id. , at\n80, the Carsons paid the tuition for their daughter to attend BCS\nthemselves, id. , at 74. Petitioners Troy and Angela Nelson live in\nPalermo, Maine. Id. , at 78. When this litigation commenced,\nthe Nelsons’ daughter attended high school at Erskine Academy, a\nsecular private school, and their son attended middle school at\nTemple Academy, a “sectarian” school affiliated with Centerpoint\nCommunity Church. Id. , at 78, 90, 91. The Nelsons sent their\nson to Temple Academy because they believed it offered him a\nhigh-quality education that aligned with their sincerely held\nreligious beliefs. Id. , at 78. While they wished to send\ntheir daughter to Temple Academy too, they could not afford to pay\nthe cost of the Academy’s tuition for both of their children. Id. , at 79. BCS and Temple Academy are both accredited by\nthe New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), and\nthe Department considers each school a “private school approved for\nattendance purposes” under the State’s compulsory attendance\nrequirement. Id. , at 80, 90. Yet because neither school\nqualifies as “nonsectarian,” neither is eligible to receive tuition\npayments under Maine’s tuition assistance program. Id. , at\n80, 90. Absent the “nonsectarian” requirement, the Carsons and the\nNelsons would have asked their respective SAUs to pay the tuition\nto send their children to BCS and Temple Academy, respectively. Id. , at 79. In 2018, petitioners brought suit against the\ncommissioner of the Maine Department of Education. Id. , at\n11–12. They alleged that the “nonsectarian” requirement of Maine’s\ntuition assistance program violated the Free Exercise Clause and\nthe Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, id. , at\n23–27, as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, id. , at 29–30. Their complaint sought declaratory\nand injunctive relief against enforcement of the requirement. Id. , at 31–32. The parties filed cross-motions for summary\njudgment on a stipulated record. 401 F. Supp. 3d 207, 208 (Me.\n2019). Applying Circuit precedent that had previously upheld the\n“nonsectarian” requirement against challenge, see Eulitt v. Maine Dept. of Ed. , 386 F.3d 344 (CA1 2004), the District Court rejected\npetitioners’ constitutional claims and granted judgment to the\ncommissioner. 401 F. Supp. 3d, at 209–212. While petitioners’ appeal to the First Circuit\nwas pending, this Court decided Espinoza v. Montana\nDepartment of Revenue , 591 U. S. ___ (2020). Espinoza held that a provision of the Montana Constitution\nbarring government aid to any school “controlled in whole or in\npart by any church, sect, or denomination,” Art. X, §6(1),\nviolated the Free Exercise Clause by prohibiting families from\nusing otherwise available scholarship funds at the religious\nschools of their choosing. The First Circuit recognized that, in\nlight of Espinoza , its prior precedent upholding Maine’s\n“nonsectarian” requirement was no longer controlling. 979\nF. 3d, at 32–36. But it nevertheless affirmed the District\nCourt’s grant of judgment to the commissioner. Id., at\n49. As relevant here, the First Circuit offered two\ngrounds to distinguish Maine’s “nonsectarian” requirement from the\nno-aid provision at issue in Espinoza . First, the panel\nreasoned that, whereas Montana had barred schools from receiving\nfunding “simply based on their religious identity—a status that in\nand of itself does not determine how a school would use the\nfunds”—Maine bars BCS and Temple Academy from receiving funding\n“based on the religious use that they would make of it in\ninstructing children.” 979 F. 3d , at 40. Second, the panel\ndetermined that Maine’s tuition assistance program was distinct\nfrom the scholarships at issue in Espinoza because Maine had\nsought to provide “a rough equivalent of the public school\neducation that Maine may permissibly require to be secular but that\nis not otherwise accessible.” 979 F. 3d , at 44. Thus, “the\nnature of the restriction at issue and the nature of the school aid\nprogram of which it is a key part” led the panel to conclude “once\nagain” that Maine’s “nonsectarian” requirement did not violate the\nFree Exercise Clause. Id., at 46. We granted certiorari. 594 U. S. ___\n(2021). II A The Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment protects against “indirect coercion or penalties on the\nfree exercise of religion, not just outright prohibitions.” Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , 450 (1988). In particular, we have repeatedly held that a\nState violates the Free Exercise Clause when it excludes religious\nobservers from otherwise available public benefits. See Sherbert v. Verner , 374 U.S.\n398 , 404 (1963) (“It is too late in the day to doubt that the\nliberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial\nof or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege.”); see\nalso Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , 330 U.S.\n1 , 16 (1947) (a State “cannot exclude” individuals “ because\nof their faith, or lack of it , from receiving the benefits of\npublic welfare legislation”). A State may not withhold unemployment\nbenefits, for instance, on the ground that an individual lost his\njob for refusing to abandon the dictates of his faith. See Sherbert , 374 U. S., at 399–402 (Seventh-day Adventist\nwho refused to work on the Sabbath); Thomas v. Review Bd.\nof Ind. Employment Security Div. , 450 U.S.\n707 , 709, 720 (1981) (Jehovah’s Witness who refused to\nparticipate in the production of armaments). We have recently applied these principles in the\ncontext of two state efforts to withhold otherwise available public\nbenefits from religious organizations. In Trinity Lutheran\nChurch of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U. S. ___\n(2017), we considered a Missouri program that offered grants to\nqualifying nonprofit organizations that installed cushioning\nplayground surfaces made from recycled rubber tires. The Missouri\nDepartment of Natural Resources maintained an express policy of\ndenying such grants to any applicant owned or controlled by a\nchurch, sect, or other religious entity. The Trinity Lutheran\nChurch Child Learning Center applied for a grant to resurface its\ngravel playground, but the Department denied funding on the ground\nthat the Center was operated by the Church. We deemed it “unremarkable in light of our prior\ndecisions” to conclude that the Free Exercise Clause did not permit\nMissouri to “expressly discriminate[ ] against otherwise\neligible recipients by disqualifying them from a public benefit\nsolely because of their religious character.” Id. , at\n___–___ (slip op., at 9–10). While it was true that Trinity\nLutheran remained “free to continue operating as a church,” it\ncould enjoy that freedom only “at the cost of automatic and\nabsolute exclusion from the benefits of a public program for which\nthe Center [was] otherwise fully qualified.” Id., at ___\n(slip op., at 10) (citing McDaniel v. Paty , 435 U.S.\n618 , 626 (1978) (plurality opinion)). Such discrimination, we\nsaid, was “odious to our Constitution” and could not stand. 582\nU. S. , at ___ (slip op., at 15). Two Terms ago, in Espinoza , we reached\nthe same conclusion as to a Montana program that provided tax\ncredits to donors who sponsored scholarships for private school\ntuition. The Montana Supreme Court held that the program, to the\nextent it included religious schools, violated a provision of the\nMontana Constitution that barred government aid to any school\ncontrolled in whole or in part by a church, sect, or denomination.\nAs a result of that holding, the State terminated the scholarship\nprogram, preventing the petitioners from accessing scholarship\nfunds they otherwise would have used to fund their children’s\neducations at religious schools. We again held that the Free Exercise Clause\nforbade the State’s action. The application of the Montana\nConstitution’s no-aid provision, we explained, required strict\nscrutiny because it “bar[red] religious schools from public\nbenefits solely because of the religious character of the schools.” Espinoza , 591 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9). “A State\nneed not subsidize private education,” we concluded, “[b]ut once a\nState decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools\nsolely because they are religious.” Id., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 20). B The “unremarkable” principles applied in Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza suffice to resolve this\ncase. Maine offers its citizens a benefit: tuition assistance\npayments for any family whose school district does not provide a\npublic secondary school. Just like the wide range of nonprofit\norganizations eligible to receive playground resurfacing grants in Trinity Lutheran , a wide range of private schools are\neligible to receive Maine tuition assistance payments here. And\nlike the daycare center in Trinity Lutheran , BCS and Temple\nAcademy are disqualified from this generally available benefit\n“solely because of their religious character.” 582 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 10). By “condition[ing] the availability of\nbenefits” in that manner, Maine’s tuition assistance program—like\nthe program in Trinity Lutheran —“effectively penalizes the\nfree exercise” of religion. Ibid. (quoting McDaniel ,\n435 U. S., at 626 (plurality opinion)). Our recent decision in Espinoza applied\nthese basic principles in the context of religious education that\nwe consider today. There, as here, we considered a state benefit\nprogram under which public funds flowed to support tuition payments\nat private schools. And there, as here, that program specifically\ncarved out private religious schools from those eligible to receive\nsuch funds. While the wording of the Montana and Maine provisions\nis different, their effect is the same: to “disqualify some private\nschools” from funding “solely because they are religious.” 591\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 20). A law that operates in that\nmanner, we held in Espinoza , must be subjected to “the\nstrictest scrutiny.” Id. , at ___–___ (slip op., at\n11–12). To satisfy strict scrutiny, government action\n“must advance ‘interests of the highest order’ and must be narrowly\ntailored in pursuit of those interests.” Church of Lukumi Babalu\nAye, Inc. v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546 (1993) (quoting McDaniel , 435 U. S., at\n628 (plurality opinion)). “A law that targets religious conduct for\ndistinctive treatment . . . will survive strict scrutiny\nonly in rare cases.” 508 U. S., at 546. This is not one of them. As noted, a neutral\nbenefit program in which public funds flow to religious\norganizations through the independent choices of private benefit\nrecipients does not offend the Establishment Clause. See Zelman , 536 U. S., at 652–653. Maine’s decision to\ncontinue excluding religious schools from its tuition assistance\nprogram after Zelman thus promotes stricter separation of\nchurch and state than the Federal Constitution requires.

But as we explained in both Trinity\nLutheran and Espinoza , such an “interest in separating\nchurch and state ‘more fiercely’ than the Federal Constitution\n. . . ‘cannot qualify as compelling’ in the face of the\ninfringement of free exercise.” Espinoza , 591 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 18) (quoting Trinity Lutheran , 582\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14)); see also Widmar v. Vincent , 454 U.S.\n263 , 276 (1981) (“[T]he state interest . . . in\nachieving greater separation of church and State than is already\nensured under the Establishment Clause . . . is limited\nby the Free Exercise Clause.”). Justice Breyer stresses the\nimportance of “government neutrality” when it comes to religious\nmatters, post , at 13, but there is nothing neutral about\nMaine’s program. The State pays tuition for certain students at\nprivate schools—so long as the schools are not religious. That is\ndiscrimination against religion. A State’s antiestablishment\ninterest does not justify enactments that exclude some members of\nthe community from an otherwise generally available public benefit\nbecause of their religious exercise.[ 1 ]* III The First Circuit attempted to distinguish our\nprecedent by recharacterizing the nature of Maine’s tuition\nassistance program in two ways, both of which Maine echoes before\nthis Court. First, the panel defined the benefit at issue as the\n“rough equivalent of [a Maine] public school education,” an\neducation that cannot include sectarian instruction. 979\nF. 3d, at 44; see also Brief for Respondent 22. Second, the\npanel defined the nature of the exclusion as one based not on a\nschool’s religious “status,” as in Trinity Lutheran and Espinoza , but on religious “uses” of public funds. 979\nF. 3d, at 38–40; see also Brief for Respondent 35. Neither of\nthese formal distinctions suffices to distinguish this case from Trinity Lutheran or Espinoza , or to affect the\napplication of the free exercise principles outlined above. A The First Circuit held that the “nonsectarian”\nrequirement was constitutional because the benefit was properly\nviewed not as tuition assistance payments to be used at approved\nprivate schools, but instead as funding for the “rough equivalent\nof the public school education that Maine may permissibly require\nto be secular.” 979 F. 3d, at 44. As Maine puts it, “[t]he\npublic benefit Maine is offering is a free public education.” Brief\nfor Respondent 1–2. To start with, the statute does not say anything\nlike that. It says that an SAU without a secondary school of its\nown “shall pay the tuition . . . at the public school or\nthe approved private school of the parent’s choice at which the\nstudent is accepted.” Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 20–A, §5204(4). The\nbenefit is tuition at a public or private school,\nselected by the parent, with no suggestion that the “private\nschool” must somehow provide a “public” education. This reading of the statute is confirmed by the\nprogram’s operation. The differences between private schools\neligible to receive tuition assistance under Maine’s program and a\nMaine public school are numerous and important. To start with the\nmost obvious, private schools are different by definition because\nthey do not have to accept all students. Public schools generally\ndo. Second, the free public education that Maine insists it is\nproviding through the tuition assistance program is often not free. That “assistance” is available at private schools\nthat charge several times the maximum benefit that Maine is willing\nto provide. See Stipulated Record, Exh. 2, in No. 1:18–cv–327 (Me.,\nMar. 12, 2019), ECF Doc. 24–2, p. 11; Brief for Respondent 32. Moreover, the curriculum taught at participating\nprivate schools need not even resemble that taught in the Maine\npublic schools. For example, Maine public schools must abide by\ncertain “parameters for essential instruction in English language\narts; mathematics; science and technology; social studies; career\nand education development; visual and performing arts; health,\nphysical education and wellness; and world languages.” §6209. But\nNEASC-accredited private schools are exempt from these\nrequirements, and instead subject only to general “standards and\nindicators” governing the implementation of their own chosen\ncurriculum. Brief for Respondent 32; see NEASC, Standards—20/20\nProcess (rev. Aug. 2021), https://cis. neasc.org/standards2020\n(requiring, for instance, that “[c]urriculum planning supports the\nschool’s core beliefs and the needs of the students,” and that the\n“[w]ritten curriculum aligns horizontally and vertically”). Private schools approved by the Department\n(rather than accredited by NEASC) are likewise exempt from many of\nthe State’s curricular requirements, so long as fewer than 60% of\ntheir students receive tuition assistance from the State. For\ninstance, such schools need not abide by Maine’s “comprehensive,\nstatewide system of learning results,” including the “parameters\nfor essential instruction” referenced above, and they need not\nadminister the annual state assessments in English language arts,\nmathematics, and science. §§2951(6), 6209; see also ECF Doc. 24–2,\nat 9. There are other distinctions, too. Participating\nschools need not hire state-certified te",

CITY OF BOSTON et\nal. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the first circuit No. 20–1800. Argued January 18, 2022—Decided\nMay 2, 2022 Just outside the entrance to Boston City Hall,\non City Hall Plaza, stand three flagpoles. Boston flies the\nAmerican flag from the first pole and the flag of the Commonwealth\nof Massachusetts from the second. Boston usually flies the city’s\nown flag from the third pole. But Boston has, for years, allowed\ngroups to hold ceremonies on the plaza during which participants\nmay hoist a flag of their choosing on the third pole in place of\nthe city’s flag. Between 2005 and 2017, Boston approved the raising\nof about 50 unique flags for 284 such ceremonies. Most of these\nflags were other countries’, but some were associated with groups\nor causes, such as the Pride Flag, a banner honoring emergency\nmedical service workers, and others. In 2017, Harold Shurtleff, the\ndirector of an organization called Camp Constitution, asked to hold\nan event on the plaza to celebrate the civic and social\ncontributions of the Christian community; as part of that ceremony,\nhe wished to raise what he described as the “Christian flag.” The\ncommissioner of Boston’s Property Management Department worried\nthat flying a religious flag at City Hall could violate the\nEstablishment Clause and found no past instance of the city’s\nhaving raised such a flag. He therefore told Shurtleff that the\ngroup could hold an event on the plaza but could not raise their\nflag during it. Shurtleff and Camp Constitution (petitioners) sued,\nclaiming that Boston’s refusal to let them raise their flag\nviolated, among other things, the First Amendment’s Free Speech\nClause. The District Court held that flying private groups’ flags\nfrom City Hall’s third flagpole amounted to government speech, so\nBoston could refuse petitioners’ request without running afoul of\nthe First Amendment. The First Circuit affirmed. This Court granted\ncertiorari to decide whether the flags Boston allows others to fly\nexpress government speech, and whether Boston could, consistent\nwith the Free Speech Clause, deny petitioners’ flag-raising\nrequest. Held : 1. Boston’s flag-raising\nprogram does not express government speech. Pp. 5–12. (a) The Free Speech Clause does not\nprevent the government from declining to express a view. See Pleasant Grove City v. Summum , 555 U.S.\n460 , 467–469. The government must be able to decide what to say\nand what not to say when it states an opinion, speaks for the\ncommunity, formulates policies, or implements programs. The\nboundary between government speech and private expression can blur\nwhen, as here, the government invites the people to participate in\na program. In those situations, the Court conducts a holistic\ninquiry to determine whether the government intends to speak for\nitself or, rather, to regulate private expression. The Court’s\ncases have looked to several types of evidence to guide the\nanalysis, including: the history of the expression at issue; the\npublic’s likely perception as to who (the government or a private\nperson) is speaking; and the extent to which the government has\nactively shaped or controlled the expression. See Walker v. Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc ., 576 U.S.\n200, 209–213. Considering these indicia in Summum , the Court\nheld that the messages of permanent monuments in a public park\nconstituted government speech, even when the monuments were\nprivately funded and donated. See 555 U. S., at 470–473. In Walker , the Court found that license plate designs proposed\nby private groups also amounted to government speech because, among\nother reasons, the State that issued the plates “maintain[ed]\ndirect control over the messages conveyed” by “actively” reviewing\ndesigns and rejecting over a dozen proposals. 576 U. S., at\n213. On the other hand, in Matal v. Tam , the Court\nconcluded that trademarking words or symbols generated by private\nregistrants did not amount to government speech because the Patent\nand Trademark Office did not exercise sufficient control over the\nnature and content of those marks to convey a governmental message.\n582 U. S.___, ___. Pp. 5–6. (b) Applying this government-speech\nanalysis here, the Court finds that some evidence favors Boston,\nand other evidence favors Shurtleff. The history of flag flying,\nparticularly at the seat of government, supports Boston. Flags\nevolved as a way to symbolize communities and governments. Not just\nthe content of a flag, but also its presence and position have long\nconveyed important messages about government. Flying a flag other\nthan a government’s own can also convey a governmental message. For\nexample, another country’s flag outside Blair House, across the\nstreet from the White House, signals that a foreign leader is\nvisiting. Consistent with this history, flags on Boston’s City Hall\nPlaza usually convey the city’s messages. Boston’s flag symbolizes\nthe city and, when flying at halfstaff, conveys a community message\nof sympathy or somber remembrance. The question remains whether, on\nthe 20 or so times a year when Boston allowed private groups to\nraise their own flags, those flags, too, expressed the city’s\nmessage. The circumstantial evidence of the public’s perception\ndoes not resolve the issue. The most salient feature of this case\nis that Boston neither actively controlled these flag raisings nor\nshaped the messages the flags sent. To be sure, Boston maintained\ncontrol over an event’s date and time to avoid conflicts, and it\nmaintained control over the plaza’s physical premises, presumably\nto avoid chaos. But the key issue is whether Boston shaped or\ncontrolled the flags’ content and meaning; such evidence would tend\nto show that Boston intended to convey the flags’ messages as its\nown. And on that issue, Boston’s record is thin. Boston says that\nall (or at least most) of the 50 unique flags it approved reflect\nparticular city-endorsed values or causes. That may well be true of\nflying other nations’ flags, or the Pride Flag raised annually to\ncommemorate Boston Pride Week, but the connection to other\nflag-raising ceremonies, such as one held by a community bank, is\nmore difficult to discern. Further, Boston told the public that it\nsought “to accommodate all applicants” who wished to hold events at\nBoston’s “public forums,” including on City Hall Plaza. App. to\nPet. for Cert. 137a. The city’s application form asked only for\ncontact information and a brief description of the event, with\nproposed dates and times. The city employee who handled\napplications testified that he did not request to see flags before\nthe events. Indeed, the city’s practice was to approve flag\nraisings without exception—that is, until petitioners’ request. At\nthe time, Boston had no written policies or clear internal guidance\nabout what flags groups could fly and what those flags would\ncommunicate. Boston’s control is therefore not comparable to the\ndegree of government involvement in the selection of park monuments\nin Summum , see 555 U. S., at 472–473, or license plate\ndesigns in Walker , see 576 U. S., at 213. Boston’s\ncome-one-come-all practice—except, that is, for petitioners’\nflag—is much closer to the Patent and Trademark Office’s policy of\nregistering all manner of trademarks in Matal , see 582\nU. S., at ___, ___. All told, Boston’s lack of meaningful\ninvolvement in the selection of flags or the crafting of their\nmessages leads the Court to classify the third-party flag raisings\nas private, not government, speech. Pp. 6–12. 2. Because the flag-raising program did not\nexpress government speech, Boston’s refusal to let petitioners fly\ntheir flag violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.\nWhen the government does not speak for itself, it may not exclude\nprivate speech based on “religious viewpoint”; doing so\n“constitutes impermissible viewpoint discrimination.” Good News\nClub v. Milford Central School , 533 U.S.\n98 , 112. Boston concedes that it denied petitioners’ request\nout of Establishment Clause concerns, solely because the proposed\nflag “promot[ed] a specific religion.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 155a.\nIn light of the Court’s government-speech holding, Boston’s refusal\nto allow petitioners to raise their flag because of its religious\nviewpoint violated the Free Speech Clause. Pp. 12–13. 986 F.3d 78, reversed and remanded. Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Sotomayor, Kagan,\nKavanaugh, and Barrett, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 20–1800 _________________ HAROLD SHURTLEFF, et al., PETITIONERS v. CITY OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the first circuit [May 2, 2022] Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. When the government encourages diverse\nexpression—say, by creating a forum for debate—the First Amendment\nprevents it from discriminating against speakers based on their\nviewpoint. See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of\nUniv. of Va. , 515 U.S.\n819 , 828–830 (1995). But when the government speaks for itself,\nthe First Amendment does not demand airtime for all views. After\nall, the government must be able to “promote a program” or “espouse\na policy” in order to function. Walker v. Texas Div. , Sons of Confederate Veterans , Inc. , 576 U.S. 200, 208\n(2015). The line between a forum for private expression and the\ngovernment’s own speech is important, but not always clear. This case concerns a flagpole outside Boston\nCity Hall. For years, Boston has allowed private groups to request\nuse of the flagpole to raise flags of their choosing. As part of\nthis program, Boston approved hundreds of requests to raise dozens\nof different flags. The city did not deny a single request to raise\na flag until, in 2017, Harold Shurtleff, the director of a group\ncalled Camp Constitution, asked to fly a Christian flag. Boston\nrefused. At that time, Boston admits, it had no written policy\nlimiting use of the flagpole based on the content of a flag. The\nparties dispute whether, on these facts, Boston reserved the pole\nto fly flags that communicate governmental messages, or instead\nopened the flagpole for citizens to express their own views. If the\nformer, Boston is free to choose the flags it flies without the\nconstraints of the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause. If the\nlatter, the Free Speech Clause prevents Boston from refusing a flag\nbased on its viewpoint. We conclude that, on balance, Boston did not\nmake the raising and flying of private groups’ flags a form of\ngovernment speech. That means, in turn, that Boston’s refusal to\nlet Shurtleff and Camp Constitution raise their flag based on its\nreligious viewpoint “abridg[ed]” their “freedom of speech.”\nU. S. Const., Amdt. I. I A The flagpole at issue stands at the entrance\nof Boston City Hall. See Appendix, infra . Built in the late\n1960s, Boston City Hall is a raw concrete structure, an example of\nthe brutalist style. Critics of the day heralded it as a public\nbuilding that “articulates its functions” with “strength, dignity,\ngrace, and even glamor.” J. Conti, A New City Hall: Boston’s Boost\nfor Urban Renewal, Wall Street Journal, Feb. 12, 1969, p. 14.\n(The design has since proved somewhat more controversial. See, e.g. , E. Mason, Boston City Hall Named World’s Ugliest\nBuilding, Boston Herald (Nov. 15, 2008),\nhttps://www.bostonherald.com/2008/11/15/\nboston-city-hall-named-worlds-ugliest-building.) More to the point,\nBoston City Hall sits on City Hall Plaza, a 7-acre expanse paved\nwith New England brick. Inspired by open public spaces like the\nPiazza del Campo in Siena, the plaza was designed to be\n“ ‘Boston’s fairground,’ ” a “public gathering spac[e]”\nfor the people. N. DeCosta-Klipa, Why Is Boston City Hall the Way\nIt Is? Boston.com (July 25, 2018),\nhttps://www.boston.com/news/history/2018/07/ 25/boston-city-hall-brutalism. On the plaza, near City Hall’s entrance, stand\nthree 83-foot flagpoles. Boston flies the American flag from the\nfirst pole (along with a banner honoring prisoners of war and\nsoldiers missing in action). From the second, it flies the flag of\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts. And from the third, it usually\n(but not always) flies Boston’s flag—a sketch of the “City on a\nHill” encircled by a ring against a blue backdrop. Boston makes City Hall Plaza available to the\npublic for events. Boston acknowledges that this means the plaza is\na “public forum.” Brief for Respondents 27. The city’s policy is,\n“[w]here possible,” “to accommodate all applicants seeking to take\nadvantage of the City of Boston’s public forums,” including the\nplaza and the area at the flagpoles’ base. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n133a, 137a. For years, since at least 2005, the city has\nallowed groups to hold flag-raising ceremonies on the plaza.\nParticipants may hoist a flag of their choosing on the third\nflagpole (in place of the city’s flag) and fly it for the duration\nof the event, typically a couple of hours. Most ceremonies have\ninvolved the flags of other countries—from Albania to\nVenezuela—marking the national holidays of Bostonians’ many\ncountries of origin. But several flag raisings have been associated\nwith other kinds of groups or causes, such as Pride Week, emergency\nmedical service workers, and a community bank. All told, between\n2005 and 2017, Boston approved about 50 unique flags, raised at 284\nceremonies. Boston has no record of refusing a request before the\nevents that gave rise to this case. We turn now to those\nevents. B In July 2017, Harold Shurtleff, the director\nof an organization called Camp Constitution, asked to hold a flag-\nraising event that September on City Hall Plaza. The event would\n“commemorate the civic and social contributions of the Christian\ncommunity” and feature remarks by local clergy. Id ., at\n130a–131a. As part of the ceremony, the organization wished to\nraise what it described as the “Christian flag.” Id., at\n131a. To the event application, Shurtleff attached a photo of the\nproposed flag: a red cross on a blue field against a white\nbackground. The commissioner of Boston’s Property Management\nDepartment said no. The problem was “not the content of the\nChristian flag,” but “the fact that it was the Christian flag or\n[was] called the Christian flag.” App. in No. 20–1158 (CA1), at\n212–213 (deposition of then-commissioner Gregory T. Rooney,\nhereafter Rooney deposition). The commissioner worried that flying\na religious flag at City Hall could violate the Constitution’s\nEstablishment Clause and found no record of Boston ever having\nraised such a flag. He told Shurtleff that Camp Constitution could\nproceed with the event if they would raise a different flag.\nNeedless to say, they did not want to do so. C Shurtleff and Camp Constitution (petitioners)\nsued Boston and the commissioner of its Property Management\nDepartment (respondents). Petitioners claimed that Boston’s refusal\nto let them raise their flag violated, among other things, the\nFirst Amendment’s Free Speech Clause. They asked for an immediate\norder requiring Boston to allow the flag raising, but the District\nCourt denied the request. See 337 F. Supp. 3d 66 (Mass. 2018),\naff ’d, 928 F.3d 166 (CA1 2019). The parties engaged in\ndiscovery. At its close, they filed cross-motions for summary\njudgment. The parties agreed to all relevant facts and submitted a\njoint statement setting them out. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n128a–160a. On that record, the District Court held that\nflying private groups’ flags from City Hall’s third pole amounted\nto government speech. See 2020 WL 555248, *5, ___ F. Supp. 3d ___,\n___ (Mass., Feb. 4, 2020). Hence, the city acted within its\nconstitutional authority in declining to raise Camp Constitution’s\nflag. Id., at *3, *5. The District Court therefore granted\nsummary judgment for Boston. The First Circuit affirmed. See 986\nF.3d 78 (2021). Shurtleff and Camp Constitution next petitioned\nthis Court for certiorari. We agreed to decide whether the flags\nBoston allows groups to fly express government speech, and whether\nBoston could, consistent with the Free Speech Clause, deny\npetitioners’ flag-raising request. II A The first and basic question we must answer is\nwhether Boston’s flag-raising program constitutes government\nspeech. If so, Boston may refuse flags based on viewpoint. The First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause does\nnot prevent the government from declining to express a view. See Pleasant Grove City v. Summum , 555 U.S.\n460 , 467–469 (2009). When the government wishes to state an\nopinion, to speak for the community, to formulate policies, or to\nimplement programs, it naturally chooses what to say and what not\nto say. See Walker , 576 U. S., at 207–208. That must be\ntrue for government to work. Boston could not easily congratulate\nthe Red Sox on a victory were the city powerless to decline to\nsimultaneously transmit the views of disappointed Yankees fans. The\nConstitution therefore relies first and foremost on the ballot box,\nnot on rules against viewpoint discrimination, to check the\ngovernment when it speaks. See Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis.\nSystem v. Southworth , 529 U.S.\n217 , 235 (2000). The boundary between government speech and\nprivate expression can blur when, as here, a government invites the\npeople to participate in a program. In those situations, when does\ngovernment-public engagement transmit the government’s own message?\nAnd when does it instead create a forum for the expression of\nprivate speakers’ views? In answering these questions, we conduct a\nholistic inquiry designed to determine whether the government\nintends to speak for itself or to regulate private expression. Our\nreview is not mechanical; it is driven by a case’s context rather\nthan the rote application of rigid factors. Our past cases have\nlooked to several types of evidence to guide the analysis,\nincluding: the history of the expression at issue; the public’s\nlikely perception as to who (the government or a private person) is\nspeaking; and the extent to which the government has actively\nshaped or controlled the expression. See Walker , 576\nU. S., at 209–214. Considering these indicia in Summum , we\nheld that the messages of permanent monuments in a public park\nconstituted government speech, even when the monuments were\nprivately funded and donated. See 555 U. S., at 470–473. In Walker , we explained that license plate designs proposed by\nprivate groups also amounted to government speech because, among\nother reasons, the State that issued the plates “maintain[ed]\ndirect control over the messages conveyed” by “actively” reviewing\ndesigns and rejecting over a dozen proposals. 576 U. S., at\n213. In Matal v. Tam , 582 U. S. ___ (2017), on\nthe other hand, we concluded that trademarking words or symbols\ngenerated by private registrants did not amount to government\nspeech. Id. , at ___–___ (slip op., at 14–18). Though the\nPatent and Trademark Office had to approve each proposed mark, it\ndid not exercise sufficient control over the nature and content of\nthose marks to convey a governmental message in so doing. Ibid. These precedents point our way today. B Applying the government-speech analysis to\nthis record, we find that some evidence favors Boston, and other\nevidence favors Shurtleff. To begin, we look to the history of flag flying,\nparticularly at the seat of government. Were we to consider only\nthat general history, we would find that it supports Boston. Flags are almost as old as human civilization.\nIndeed, flags symbolize civilization. From the “primordial\nrag dipped in the blood of a conquered enemy and lifted high on a\nstick,” to the feudal banner bearing a lord’s coats of arms, to the\nstandards of the Aztecs, nearly every society has taken a piece of\ncloth and “endow[ed] it, through the circumstances of its display,\nwith a condensed power” to speak for the community. W. Smith, Flags\nThrough the Ages and Across the World 1–2, 32, 34 (1975). Little\nwonder that the Continental Congress, seeking to define a new\nnation, “[r]esolved” on June 14, 1777, “[t]hat the Flag of the\n. . . United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red\nand white: that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field,\nrepresenting a new constellation.” 8 Journals of the Continental\nCongress 1774–1789, p. 464 (W. Ford ed. 1907). Today, the American\nflag continues to symbolize our Nation, a constellation of 50 stars\nstanding for the 50 States. Other contemporary flags, both state and local,\nreflect their communities. Boston’s flag, for instance, bears the\ncity’s seal and motto rendered in blue and buff—the colors of the\nContinental Army’s Revolutionary War uniforms. See Symbols of the\nCity of Boston, City of Boston (July 16, 2016),\nhttps://www.boston.gov/departments/tourism-sports-\nand-entertainment/symbols-city-boston (Symbols of Boston). Not just the content of a flag, but also its\npresence and position have long conveyed important messages about\ngovernment. The early morning sight of the stars and stripes above\nFort McHenry told Francis Scott Key (and, through his poem, he told\nthe rest of us) that the great experiment—the land of the free—had\nsurvived the British attack on Baltimore Harbor. See C. Lineberry,\nThe Story Behind the Star Spangled Banner, Smithsonian Magazine\n(Mar. 1, 2007). No less familiar, a flag at halfstaff tells us that\nthe government is paying its “respect to th[e] memory” of someone\nwho has died. 4 U. S. C. §7(m). (Congress has explained,\nacross several sections of the U. S. Code, the meaning we\nshould take from the “position,” “manner,” “time,” and “occasions”\nof the American flag’s display. §§6, 7.) And the presence of the\nRoyal Standard flying from Windsor Castle’s Round Tower says the\nQueen is home. See Windsor Castle Today, Royal Collection Trust,\nwww.rct.uk/visit/ windsor-castle/windsor-castle-today. The flying of a flag other than a government’s\nown can also convey a governmental message. A foreign flag outside\nBlair House, across the street from the White House, signals that a\nforeign leader is visiting and the residence has “becom[e] a de\nfacto diplomatic mission of the guest’s home nation.” M. French,\nUnited States Protocol: The Guide to Official Diplomatic Etiquette\n298 (2010). And, according to international custom, when flags of\ntwo or more nations are displayed together, they cannot be flown\none nation above the other “in time of peace.” 4 U. S. C.\n§7(g). Keeping with this tradition, flags on Boston’s\nCity Hall Plaza usually convey the city’s messages. On a typical\nday, the American flag, the Massachusetts flag, and the City of\nBoston’s flag wave from three flagpoles. Boston’s flag, when flying\nthere at full mast, symbolizes the city. When flying at halfstaff,\nit conveys a community message of sympathy or somber remembrance.\nWhen displayed at other public buildings, it marks the mayor’s\npresence. See Symbols of Boston. The city also sometimes conveys a\nmessage by replacing its flag with another. When Boston’s mayor\nlost a bet with Montreal’s about whose hockey team would win a\nplayoff series, Boston, duty-bound in defeat, hoisted the\nCanadiens’ banner. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 54–55. While this history favors Boston, it is only our\nstarting point. The question remains whether, on the 20 or so times\na year when Boston allowed private groups to raise their own flags,\nthose flags, too, expressed the city’s message. So we must examine\nthe details of this flag-flying program. Next, then, we consider whether the public would\ntend to view the speech at issue as the government’s. In this case,\nthe circumstantial evidence does not tip the scale. On an ordinary\nday, a passerby on Cambridge Street sees three government flags\nrepresenting the Nation, State, and city. Those flags wave “in\nunison, side-by-side, from matching flagpoles,” just outside\n“ ‘the entrance to Boston’s seat of government.’ ” 986\nF. 3d, at 88. Like the monuments in the public park in Summum , the flags “play an important role in defining the\nidentity that [the] city projects to its own residents and to the\noutside world.” 555 U. S., at 472. So, like the license plates\nin Walker , the public seems likely to see the flags as\n“ ‘conveying some message’ ” on the government’s\n“ ‘behalf.’ ” 576 U. S., at 212 (quoting Summum , 555 U. S., at 471). But as we have said, Boston allowed its flag to\nbe lowered and other flags to be raised with some regularity. These\nother flags were raised in connection with ceremonies at the\nflagpoles’ base and remained aloft during the events. Petitioners\nsay that a pedestrian glimpsing a flag other than Boston’s on the\nthird flagpole might simply look down onto the plaza, see a group\nof private citizens conducting a ceremony without the city’s\npresence, and associate the new flag with them, not Boston. Thus,\neven if the public would ordinarily associate a flag’s message with\nBoston, that is not necessarily true for the flags at issue here.\nAgain, this evidence of the public’s perception does not resolve\nwhether Boston conveyed a city message with these flags. Finally, we look at the extent to which Boston\nactively controlled these flag raisings and shaped the messages the\nflags sent. The answer, it seems, is not at all. And that is the\nmost salient feature of this case. To be sure, Boston maintained control over an\nevent’s date and time to avoid conflicts. It maintained control\nover the plaza’s physical premises, presumably to avoid chaos. And\nit provided a hand crank so that groups could rig and raise their\nchosen flags. But it is Boston’s control over the flags’ content\nand meaning that here is key; that type of control would indicate\nthat Boston meant to convey the flags’ messages. On this issue, Boston’s record is thin. Boston\nsays that all (or at least most) of the 50 unique flags it approved\nreflect particular city-approved values or views. Flying flags\nassociated with other countries celebrated Bostonians’ many\ndifferent national origins; flying other flags, Boston adds, was\nnot “wholly unconnected” from a diversity message or “some other\nday or cause the City or Commonwealth had already endorsed.” Brief\nfor Respondents 8, 35. That may well be true of the Pride Flag\nraised annually to commemorate Boston Pride Week. See Brief for\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts et al. as Amici Curiae 25–26 (citing reports that the then-mayor of Boston gave remarks as\nthe Pride Flag was raised). But it is more difficult to discern a\nconnection to the city as to, say, the Metro Credit Union flag\nraising, a ceremony by a local community bank. In any event, we do not settle this dispute by\ncounting noses—or, rather, counting flags. That is so for several\nreasons. For one thing, Boston told the public that it sought “to\naccommodate all applicants” who wished to hold events at Boston’s\n“public forums,” including on City Hall Plaza. App. to Pet. for\nCert. 137a. The application form asked only for contact information\nand a brief description of the event, with proposed dates and\ntimes. The city employee who handled applications testified by\ndeposition that he had previously “never requested to review a flag\nor requested changes to a flag in connection with approval”; nor\ndid he even see flags before the events. Id. , at 150a. The\ncity’s practice was to approve flag raisings, without exception. It\nhas no record of denying a request until Shurtleff ’s. Boston\nacknowledges it “hadn’t spent a lot of time really thinking about”\nits flag-raising practices until this case. App. in No. 20–1158\n(CA1), at 140 (Rooney deposition). True to its word, the city had\nnothing—no written policies or clear internal guidance—about what\nflags groups could fly and what those flags would communicate. Compare the extent of Boston’s control over flag\nraisings with the degree of government involvement in our most\nrelevant precedents. In Summum , we emphasized that Pleasant\nGrove City always selected which monuments it would place in its\npark (whether or not the government funded those monuments), and it\ntypically took ownership over them. 555 U. S., at 472–473. In Walker , a state board “maintain[ed] direct control” over\nlicense plate designs by “actively” reviewing every proposal and\nrejecting at least a dozen. 576 U. S., at 213. Boston has no\ncomparable record. The facts of this case are much closer to Matal v. Tam . There, we held that trademarks were not\ngovernment speech because the Patent and Trademark Office\nregistered all manner of marks and normally did not consider their\nviewpoint, except occasionally to turn away marks it deemed\n“offensive.” 582 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 14, 22).\nBoston’s come-one-come-all attitude—except, that is, for Camp\nConstitution’s religious flag—is similar. Boston could easily have done more to make clear\nit wished to speak for itself by raising flags. Other cities’\nflag-flying policies support our conclusion. The City of San Jose,\nCalifornia, for example, provides in writing that its\n“ ‘flagpoles are not intended to serve as a forum for free\nexpression by the public,’ ” and lists approved flags that may\nbe flown “ ‘as an expression of the City’s official\nsentiments.’ ” See Brief for Commonwealth of Massachusetts et\nal. as Amici Curiae 18. All told, while the historical practice of flag\nflying at government buildings favors Boston, the city’s lack of\nmeaningful involvement in the selection of flags or the crafting of\ntheir messages leads us to classify the flag raisings as private,\nnot government, speech—though nothing prevents Boston from changing\nits policies going forward. III Last, we consider whether Boston’s refusal to\nallow Shurtleff and Camp Constitution to raise their flag amounted\nto impermissible viewpoint discrimination. Boston acknowledges that it denied\nShurtleff ’s request because it believed flying a religious\nflag at City Hall could violate the Establishment Clause. And it\nadmits this concern proceeded from the premise that raising the\nflag would express government speech. See Brief in Opposition 23\n(explaining that “viewpoint neutrality” was “incompatible” with\nBoston’s view of its program). But we have rejected that premise in\nthe preceding pages. We must therefore consider Boston’s actions in\nlight of our holding. When a government does not speak for itself, it\nmay not exclude speech based on “religious viewpoint”; doing so\n“constitutes impermissible viewpoint discrimination.” Good News\nClub v. Milford Central School , 533 U.S.\n98 , 112 (2001). Applying that rule, we have held, for example,\nthat a public university may not bar student-activity funds from\nreimbursing only religious groups. See Rosenberger , 515\nU. S., at 830–834. Here, Boston concedes that it denied\nShurtleff ’s request solely because the Christian flag he\nasked to raise “promot[ed] a specific religion.” App. to Pet. for\nCert. 155a (quoting Rooney deposition). Under our precedents, and\nin view of our government-speech holding here, that refusal\ndiscriminated based on religious viewpoint and violated the Free\nSpeech Clause. *  *  * For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that\nBoston’s flag-raising program does not express government speech.\nAs a result, the city’s refusal to let Shurtleff and Camp\nConstitution fly their flag based on its religious viewpoint\nviolated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. We reverse\nthe First Circuit’s contrary judgment and remand the case for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.",

VAELLO MADERO certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the first circuit No. 20–303. Argued November 9, 2021—Decided\nApril 21, 2022 The Territory Clause of the United States\nConstitution—which states that Congress may “make all needful Rules\nand Regulations respecting the Territory . . . belonging\nto the United States,” Art. IV, §3, cl. 2—affords Congress\nbroad authority to legislate with respect to the U. S.\nTerritories. In exercising that authority, Congress has long\nmaintained different federal tax and benefits programs for\nresidents of the Territories than for residents of the 50 States.\nFor example, residents of Puerto Rico are typically exempt from\nmost federal income, gift, estate, and excise taxes. See 48\nU. S. C. §734; see, e.g., 26 U. S. C.\n§§933, 2209, 4081–4084. But just as not every federal tax extends\nto residents of Puerto Rico, so too not every federal benefits\nprogram extends to residents of Puerto Rico. One such benefits\nprogram is Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which by statute\napplies only to residents of the 50 States and the District of\nColumbia. 42 U. S. C. §1382c(a)(1)(B)(i). The question\npresented is whether the equal-protection component of the Fifth\nAmendment’s Due Process Clause requires Congress to make\nSupplemental Security Income benefits available to residents of\nPuerto Rico to the same extent that Congress makes those benefits\navailable to residents of the States. Here, respondent Jose Luis Vaello Madero\nreceived SSI benefits while he was a resident of New York. He then\nmoved to Puerto Rico, where he was no longer eligible to receive\nthose benefits. Unaware of Vaello Madero’s new residence, the\nGovernment continued to pay him SSI benefits. The Government\neventually sued Vaello Madero to recover those errant payments,\nwhich totaled more than $28,000. In response, Vaello Madero invoked\nthe Constitution, arguing that Congress’s exclusion of residents of\nPuerto Rico from the SSI program violated the equal-protection\ncomponent of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The District\nCourt and the Court of Appeals agreed. Held : The Constitution does not\nrequire Congress to extend SSI benefits to residents of Puerto\nRico. In Califano v. Torres, 435 U.S.\n1 , and Harris v. Rosario, 446\nU.S. 651 , the Court applied the deferential rational-basis test\nto uphold Congress’s decision not to extend certain federal\nbenefits to Puerto Rico, noting that because Congress chose to\ntreat residents of Puerto Rico differently from residents of the\nStates for purposes of tax laws, it could do the same for benefits\nprograms. Those two precedents dictate the result here. Congress’s\ndecision to exempt Puerto Rico’s residents from most federal\nincome, gift, estate, and excise taxes supplies a rational basis\nfor likewise distinguishing residents of Puerto Rico from residents\nof the States for purposes of the SSI benefits program. Vaello\nMadero’s contrary position would usher in potentially far-reaching\nconsequences, with serious implications for the Puerto Rican people\nand the Puerto Rican economy. The Constitution does not require\nthat extreme outcome. Pp. 4–6. 956 F.3d 12, reversed. Kavanaugh, J., delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, in which Roberts, C. J., and Thomas, Breyer, Alito,\nKagan, Gorsuch, and Barrett, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., and Gorsuch,\nJ., filed concurring opinions. Sotomayor, J., filed a dissenting\nopinion.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 20–303 _________________ United States, PETITIONER v. Jose Luis\nVaello Madero on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the first circuit [April 21, 2022] Justice Kavanaugh delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. The United States includes five Territories:\nAmerican Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U. S.\nVirgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. This case involves Puerto Rico,\nwhich became a U. S. Territory in 1898 in the wake of the\nSpanish-American War. For various historical and policy reasons,\nincluding local autonomy, Congress has not required residents of\nPuerto Rico to pay most federal income, gift, estate, and excise\ntaxes. Congress has likewise not extended certain federal benefits\nprograms to residents of Puerto Rico. The question presented is whether the\nequal-protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause requires Congress to make Supplemental Security Income\nbenefits available to residents of Puerto Rico to the same extent\nthat Congress makes those benefits available to residents of the\nStates. In light of the text of the Constitution, longstanding\nhistorical practice, and this Court’s precedents, the answer is\nno. *  *  * The Territory Clause of the Constitution\nstates that Congress may “make all needful Rules and Regulations\nrespecting the Territory . . . belonging to the United\nStates.” Art. IV, §3, cl. 2. The text of the Clause affords\nCongress broad authority to legislate with respect to the\nU. S. Territories. Exercising that authority, Congress sometimes\nlegislates differently with respect to the Territories, including\nPuerto Rico, than it does with respect to the States. That\nlongstanding congressional practice reflects both national and\nlocal considerations. In tackling the many facets of territorial\ngovernance, Congress must make numerous policy judgments that\naccount not only for the needs of the United States as a whole but\nalso for (among other things) the unique histories, economic\nconditions, social circumstances, independent policy views, and\nrelative autonomy of the individual Territories. Of relevance here, Congress must decide how to\nstructure federal taxes and benefits for residents of the\nTerritories. In doing so, Congress has long maintained federal tax\nand benefits programs for residents of Puerto Rico and the other\nTerritories that differ in some respects from the federal tax and\nbenefits programs for residents of the 50 States. On the tax side, for example, residents of\nPuerto Rico are typically exempt from most federal income, gift,\nestate, and excise taxes. See 39Stat. 954, as amended, 48\nU. S. C. §734; see, e.g. , 26 U. S. C.\n§§933, 2209, 4081–4084. At the same time, residents of Puerto Rico\ngenerally pay Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment taxes. 26\nU. S. C. §§3121(e), 3306(j). On the benefits side, residents of Puerto Rico\nare eligible for Social Security and Medicare. §3121(e); 42\nU. S. C. §§410(h)–(i), 1301(a)(1). Residents of Puerto\nRico are also eligible for federal unemployment benefits. 26\nU. S. C. §3306(j); see also House Committee on Ways and\nMeans, Green Book: Background Material and Data on the Programs\nWithin the Jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means, App. A\n(24th ed. 2018). But just as not every federal tax extends to\nresidents of Puerto Rico, so too not every federal benefits program\nextends to residents of Puerto Rico. One example is the\nSupplemental Security Income program, which Congress passed and\nPresident Nixon signed into law in 1972. 86Stat. 1465. The\nSupplemental Security Income program provides benefits for, among\nothers, those who are age 65 or older and cannot financially\nsupport themselves. To be eligible for Supplemental Security Income,\nan individual must be a “resident of the United States,” 42\nU. S. C. §1382c(a)(1)(B)(i), which the statute defines as\nthe 50 States and the District of Columbia, §1382c(e). A later\nstatute included residents of the Northern Mariana Islands in the\nprogram. Note following 48 U. S. C. §1801; 90Stat. 268.\nBut residents of Puerto Rico are not eligible for Supplemental\nSecurity Income. Instead, the Federal Government provides\nsupplemental income assistance to covered residents of Puerto Rico\nthrough a different benefits program—one that is funded in part by\nthe Federal Government and in part by Puerto Rico. Notes following\n§§1381−1385. The dispute in this case concerns a claim for\nSupplemental Security Income benefits by a resident of Puerto Rico\nnamed Jose Luis Vaello Madero. In 2013, Vaello Madero moved from\nNew York to Puerto Rico. While he lived in New York, Vaello Madero\nreceived Supplemental Security Income benefits. After moving to\nPuerto Rico, Vaello Madero no longer was eligible for Supplemental\nSecurity Income benefits. Yet for several years, the U. S.\nGovernment remained unaware of Vaello Madero’s new residence and\ncontinued to pay him benefits. The overpayment totaled more than\n$28,000. Seeking to recover those errant payments, the\nU. S. Government sued Vaello Madero for restitution. In\nresponse, Vaello Madero invoked the U. S. Constitution. Vaello\nMadero argued that Congress’s exclusion of residents of Puerto Rico\nfrom the Supplemental Security Income program violated the\nequal-protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process\nClause. Vaello Madero’s constitutional argument\nprevailed in the District Court and the Court of Appeals, 956 F.3d\n12 (CA1 2020), and we granted certiorari, 592 U. S. ___\n(2021). We respectfully disagree with those Courts. In our view,\nthis Court’s precedents, in addition to the constitutional text and\nhistorical practice discussed above, establish that Congress may\ndistinguish the Territories from the States in tax and benefits\nprograms such as Supplemental Security Income, so long as Congress\nhas a rational basis for doing so. In Califano v. Torres , the Court\naddressed whether Congress’s decision not to extend Supplemental\nSecurity Income to Puerto Rico violated the constitutional right to\ninterstate travel. 435 U.S. 1 (1978) ( per curiam ). Applying the deferential\nrational-basis test, the Court upheld Congress’s decision. The\nCourt explained that Congress had exempted residents of Puerto Rico\nfrom federal taxes. And the Court concluded that Congress could\nlikewise treat residents of Puerto Rico differently from residents\nof the States in the Supplemental Security Income benefits program. Id ., at 3–5, and n. 7. A few years later, in Harris v. Rosario , the Court again ruled that Congress’s differential\ntreatment of Puerto Rico in a federal benefits program did not\nviolate the Constitution—this time, the equal-protection component\nof the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. 446 U.S.\n651 (1980) ( per curiam ). The Court stated that the\nTerritory Clause permits Congress to “treat Puerto Rico differently\nfrom States so long as there is a rational basis for its actions.” Id ., at 651−652. Citing the prior decision in Torres ,\nthe Court noted that Congress’s tax laws treated residents of\nPuerto Rico differently from residents of the States. And the Court\nconcluded that Congress could do the same for that benefits\nprogram. 446 U. S., at 651–652. Those two precedents dictate the result here.\nThe deferential rational-basis test applies. And Puerto Rico’s tax status—in particular, the fact that residents of Puerto\nRico are typically exempt from most federal income, gift, estate,\nand excise taxes—supplies a rational basis for likewise\ndistinguishing residents of Puerto Rico from residents of the\nStates for purposes of the Supplemental Security Income benefits program. See Torres , 435 U. S., at 5,\nn. 7; Rosario , 446 U. S., at 652. In devising tax\nand benefits programs, it is reasonable for Congress to take\naccount of the general balance of benefits to and burdens on the\nresidents of Puerto Rico. In doing so, Congress need not conduct a\ndollar-to-dollar comparison of how its tax and benefits programs\napply in the States as compared to the Territories, either at the\nindividual or collective level. See Torres , 435 U. S.,\nat 3–5, and n. 7; Rosario , 446 U. S., at 652.\nCongress need only have a rational basis for its tax and benefits\nprograms. Congress has satisfied that requirement here. Moreover, Vaello Madero’s position would usher\nin potentially far-reaching consequences. For one, Congress would\npresumably need to extend not just Supplemental Security Income but\nalso many other federal benefits programs to residents of the\nTerritories in the same way that those programs cover residents of\nthe States. And if this Court were to require identical treatment\non the benefits side, residents of the States could presumably\ninsist that federal taxes be imposed on residents of Puerto\nRico and other Territories in the same way that those taxes are\nimposed on residents of the States. Doing that, however, would\ninflict significant new financial burdens on residents of Puerto\nRico, with serious implications for the Puerto Rican people and the\nPuerto Rican economy. The Constitution does not require that\nextreme outcome.[ 1 ] *  *  * The Constitution affords Congress substantial\ndiscretion over how to structure federal tax and benefits programs\nfor residents of the Territories. Exercising that discretion,\nCongress may extend Supplemental Security Income benefits to\nresidents of Puerto Rico. Indeed, the Solicitor General has\ninformed the Court that the President supports such legislation as\na matter of policy. But the limited question before this Court is\nwhether, under the Constitution, Congress must extend\nSupplemental Security Income to residents of Puerto Rico to the\nsame extent as to residents of the States. The answer is no. We\ntherefore reverse the judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals\nfor the First Circuit. It is so ordered. Notes 1 The Court’s decision today\nshould not be read to imply that Congress may exclude residents of\nindividual States from benefits programs. Congress has not done so,\nand that question is not presented in this case.",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus BROWN, ACTING WARDEN v . DAVENPORT certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the sixth circuit No. 20–826. Argued October 5, 2021—Decided\nApril 21, 2022 Ervine Davenport was convicted of first-degree\nmurder following a jury trial where, at times, he sat shackled at a\ntable with a “privacy screen.” On appeal, he argued that his\nconviction should be set aside in light of Deck v. Missouri , 544 U.S.\n622 , in which this Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment’s\nDue Process Clause generally forbids shackling a criminal defendant\nat trial absent “a special need.” Id. , at 626. Finding no\n“special need” articulated in the record, the Michigan Supreme\nCourt agreed that a Deck violation had occurred and remanded\nthe case to the trial court to determine under Chapman v. California , 386 U.S.\n18 , whether the prosecution could establish that the Deck error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. On\nremand, the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing at which\njurors testified that the shackles had not affected their verdict\nand concluded that the State had carried its burden. Mr. Davenport\nappealed again, and the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the\ntrial court. The Michigan Supreme Court declined review. Mr. Davenport petitioned for federal habeas\nrelief. The District Court found relief unwarranted under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which limits\nthe power of federal courts to issue habeas relief to state\nprisoners. See 28 U. S. C. §2254(d). A divided Sixth\nCircuit panel reversed, declining to analyze the case under AEDPA.\nInstead, the court held that its review was governed only by Brecht v. Abrahamson , 507 U.S.\n619 , which held that a state prisoner seeking to challenge his\nconviction on the basis of a state court’s Chapman error\nmust show that the error had a “ ‘substantial and injurious\neffect or influence’ ” on the trial’s outcome, id. , at\n637. Persuaded that Mr. Davenport could satisfy Brecht , the\nSixth Circuit granted federal habeas relief and ordered Michigan\neither to retry or release Mr. Davenport. This Court granted\ncertiorari to resolve a circuit conflict about the proper\ninteraction between the tests found in Brecht and AEDPA. Held : When a state court has ruled\non the merits of a state prisoner’s claim, a federal court cannot\ngrant habeas relief without applying both the test this Court\noutlined in Brecht and the one Congress prescribed in AEDPA;\nthe Sixth Circuit erred in granting habeas relief to Mr. Davenport\nbased solely on its assessment that he could satisfy the Brecht standard. Pp. 6–25. (a) When Congress supplies a\nconstitutionally valid rule of decision, federal courts must follow\nit. In AEDPA, Congress instructed that a federal court “shall not .\n. . gran[t]” relief with respect to a claim that has been\nadjudicated on the merits in state court “unless” certain\nconditions are met. §2254(d). To be sure, the court below in this\ncase was required to ensure that petitioner carried his burden\nunder the terms of Brecht . But satisfying Brecht is\nonly a necessary condition to habeas relief here; AEDPA must also\nbe satisfied. The Sixth Circuit erred in holding otherwise.\nPp. 6–7. (b) Since the founding, Congress has\nauthorized federal courts to issue habeas writs to federal\ncustodians, and since the Civil War, Congress has extended that\nauthority to include issuance of writs to state custodians. All\nalong, Congress’s statutes used permissive rather than mandatory\nlanguage; federal courts enjoy the “power to” grant writs of habeas\ncorpus in certain circumstances. That structure persists today;\nfederal courts “may” grant habeas relief “as law and justice\nrequire.” 28 U. S. C. §§2241, 2243. Under the traditional understanding of habeas\ncorpus, a prisoner could not usually use the writ to challenge a\nfinal judgment of conviction issued by a court of competent\njurisdiction. But by 1953, this Court had begun to depart from that\nunderstanding. In Brown v. Allen , 344 U.S.\n443 , 458, it held that a state-court judgment “is not res\njudicata ” in federal habeas proceedings with respect to a\npetitioner’s federal constitutional claims. After Brown ,\nfederal courts struggled with an exploding caseload of habeas\npetitions from state prisoners. Eventually, this Court responded by devising\nnew rules aimed at separating the meritorious needles from the\ngrowing haystack of habeas petitions. The Court’s decision in Brecht— which reasoned that Chapman ’s harmless-error\nrule for direct appeals was inappropriate for use in federal habeas\nreview of final state-court judgments, 507 U. S., at\n633–634—was part of that effort. Brecht , like this Court’s\nother equitable doctrines restricting habeas relief, stems\nultimately from the discretion preserved by Congress’s habeas\nstatutes. Congress later introduced its own reforms in\nAEDPA, instructing that, if a state court has adjudicated the\npetitioner’s claim on the merits, a federal court “shall not” grant\nhabeas relief “unless” the state court’s decision was (1) “contrary\nto” or an “unreasonable application of” clearly established federal\nlaw, as determined by the decisions of this Court, or (2) based on\nan “unreasonable determination of the facts” presented in the\nstate-court proceeding. 28 U. S. C. §2254(d). AEDPA thus left\nintact the equitable discretion invested in federal courts by\nearlier federal habeas statutes. Pp. 7–14. (c) Mr. Davenport’s two arguments in\ndefense of the Sixth Circuit’s decision lack merit.\nPp. 14–21. (1) Mr. Davenport argues that because the\nAEDPA inquiry represents a logical subset of the Brecht test, the Sixth Circuit necessarily found that he satisfied AEDPA\nwhen he satisfied Brecht. That argument is mistaken. Proof\nof prejudice under Brecht does not equate to a successful\nshowing under AEDPA. The inquiries under Brecht and AEDPA\nare different. Where AEDPA asks whether every fair-minded\njurist would agree that an error was prejudicial, Brecht asks only whether a federal habeas court itself harbors\ngrave doubt about the petitioner’s verdict. The legal materials a\ncourt may consult when answering each test also differ. Where AEDPA\nrequires state-court decisions to be measured against this Court’s\nclearly established holdings, Brecht invites analysis based\non the whole body of law. Assuming that the Sixth Circuit’s\nanalysis was enough to satisfy Brecht , it was not enough to\nwarrant eligibility for relief under AEDPA. Pp. 14–16. (2) Mr. Davenport argues that this\nCourt’s precedents in Fry v. Pliler , 551 U.S.\n112 , and Davis v . Ayala , 576 U.S. 257, require a\nruling in his favor. But the holding in neither case helps Mr.\nDavenport, and neither case resolved the question now before the\nCourt. Instead, Mr. Davenport focuses on a brief passage from Fry , repeated in Ayala —“it certainly makes no sense\nto require formal application of both tests (AEDPA/ Chapman and Brecht ) when the latter obviously subsumes the former,”\n551 U. S., at 120—that he believes supports the theory that a court\nmay grant relief without applying AEDPA. It does not. In any event,\nthis Court has long stressed that “the language of an opinion is\nnot always to be parsed as though we were dealing with [the]\nlanguage of a statute.” Reiter v. Sonotone Corp ., 442 U.S.\n330 . The Court will not override a lawful congressional command\non the basis of curated snippets extracted from decisions with no\nreason to pass on the arguments Mr. Davenport presses here.\nPp. 17–21. (d) Even assuming that Mr. Davenport’s\nclaim can survive Brecht , he cannot satisfy AEDPA. Mr.\nDavenport argues the Michigan Court of Appeals’ disposition of his\nshackling claim is contrary to, or an unreasonable application of,\nthis Court’s decision in Holbrook v. Flynn , 475 U.S.\n560 . Holbrook rejected the defendant’s claim that he was\ndenied a fair trial due to the prejudicial effect of supplemental\ncourtroom security on the jury. Id ., at 562. The language in Holbrook Mr. Davenport highlights casts doubt only on\nattempts to assess trial prejudice based on speculative testimony\nby prospective jurors. Nothing in Holbrook is inconsistent\nwith the Michigan Court of Appeals’ reliance on post-trial\ntestimony from actual jurors concerning the effect on deliberations\nof security measures at Mr. Davenport’s trial. Nor did the Michigan\ncourt unreasonably apply Chapman when it found that the\nprosecution had established Mr. Davenport’s shackling was harmless\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. This Court cannot say that every fairminded jurist applying Chapman must reach a different\nconclusion. Similarly, the Court cannot say that every fairminded\ncourt would have both identified and adopted Mr. Davenport’s\nforfeited theory that his shackling might have influenced the jury\ntoward a first-degree, rather than second-degree, murder\nconviction.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 20–826 _________________ MIKE BROWN, ACTING WARDEN, PETITIONER v. ERVINE DAVENPORT on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit [April 21, 2022] Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. After a state court determines that an error at\ntrial did not prejudice a criminal defendant, may a federal court\ngrant habeas relief based solely on its independent assessment of\nthe error’s prejudicial effect under Brecht v. Abrahamson , 507 U.S.\n619 (1993)? Or must a federal court also evaluate the state\ncourt’s decision under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA)? The Sixth Circuit ruled that an\nindividual who satisfies Brecht alone is entitled to habeas\nrelief. This was mistaken. When a state court has ruled on the\nmerits of a state prisoner’s claim, a federal court cannot grant\nrelief without first applying both the test this Court outlined in Brecht and the one Congress prescribed in AEDPA. I A One evening in 2007, Annette White attended a\ngathering with Ervine Davenport. On the drive home, Mr. Davenport\nkilled Ms. White. At trial, the only questions concerned why and\nhow. Mr. Davenport claimed self-defense and testified to that\neffect. On his account, Ms. White grew angry during the trip and\ntried to grab the steering wheel from him while he was driving.\nThen she pulled out a box cutter and cut his arm. Mr. Davenport\nresponded by extending one arm and pinning Ms. White against the\npassenger side of the car, with his hand under her chin.\nEventually, she stopped struggling. On discovering that Ms. White\nwas no longer breathing, Mr. Davenport panicked and left her body\nin a field. The prosecution offered a very different version\nof events. It stressed that Ms. White was 5’2” tall, 103 pounds,\nand had a broken wrist, while Mr. Davenport was 6’5” tall and\nweighed nearly 300 pounds. The prosecution presented evidence that\nMr. Davenport had bragged to others before the killing that, if he\nhad a problem with someone, he would choke the person. Days before\nMs. White’s death, Mr. Davenport had done just that—strangling\nanother woman until she lost consciousness and urinated on herself.\nNor, on the prosecution’s account, were Mr. Davenport’s actions\nafter Ms. White’s death consistent with his claim of self-defense.\nInstead of contacting the police, he not only abandoned his\nvictim’s body. He also fled the scene and later visited Ms. White’s\nhome where he stole electronics and food. He told a witness, too,\nthat he “had to off ” Ms. White. The prosecution offered additional proof. When\npolice questioned Mr. Davenport, he gave differing accounts and\ninitially denied any involvement in Ms. White’s death. While\nauthorities did locate a box cutter in the car, they did not find\nit inside the cab of the vehicle but in the trunk and untainted by\nblood. Also, a forensic pathologist testified that Ms. White died\nof manual strangulation. The pathologist explained that a victim of\nstrangulation may lose consciousness after 30 seconds, but that\ndeath does not occur until the victim is without air for at least\nfour to five minutes. After Mr. Davenport testified that he merely\nextended his arm across Ms. White’s neck to keep her from cutting\nhim, the forensic pathologist offered his view that this account\nwas not plausible. Ms. White’s injuries, found on both sides of her\nneck, were consistent with strangulation—but inconsistent with the\napplication of broad force across the front of her neck. After a 7-day trial, a jury convicted Mr.\nDavenport of first-degree murder. B On direct appeal in state court, Mr. Davenport\nsought to have his conviction set aside in light of Deck v. Missouri , 544 U.S.\n622 (2005). In Deck , this Court held that the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s Due Process Clause generally forbids shackling a\ncriminal defendant at trial absent “a special need.” Id. , at\n626. Mr. Davenport noted that during his trial (but not his\ntestimony) officials shackled one of his hands, his waist, and his\nankles. Those shackles may not have been visible to many in the\ncourtroom because of a “privacy screen” around the table where Mr.\nDavenport sat. But the trial court did not articulate on the record\nany special need for its security measures. Ultimately, the Michigan Supreme Court agreed\nthat the trial court’s actions violated Deck . At the same\ntime, the court sought to apply Chapman v. California , 386 U.S.\n18 (1967). In Chapman , this Court held that a preserved\nclaim of constitutional error identified on direct appeal does not\nrequire reversal of a conviction if the prosecution can establish\nthat the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. ,\nat 24. To answer Chapman ’s question, the Michigan Supreme\nCourt remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to\ndetermine whether “the jury saw the defendant’s shackles” and, if\nso, “whether the prosecution can demonstrate beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the shackling error did not contribute to the verdict\nagainst the defendant.” People v. Davenport , 488\nMich. 1054, 794 N.W.2d 616 (2011). On remand, the trial court conducted an\nevidentiary hearing in which it heard from all 12 jurors. Five\nremembered seeing Mr. Davenport’s restraints; the remaining seven\ndid not. All 12 testified that Mr. Davenport’s shackles did not\nenter into their deliberations or influence their unanimous\nverdict. Based on this evidence, the trial court found that the\nState had carried its burden to show harmlessness beyond a\nreasonable doubt. Again, Mr. Davenport appealed. This time,\nMichigan’s appellate courts declined to disturb the judgment. For\nits part, the Michigan Court of Appeals held that “the prosecution\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt that the shackling error did not\naffect the verdict.” People v. Davenport , 2012 WL\n6217134, *3 (Dec. 13, 2012) ( per curiam ). In doing so,\nthe court relied on both the jurors’ testimony and that “the\nevidence at trial overwhelmingly established defendant’s guilt and\nbelied his contention that he killed the 103-pound victim in\nself-defense, a theory that was explicitly disputed by expert\nmedical testimony.” Id. , at *2, n. 2. The Michigan\nSupreme Court denied Mr. Davenport’s request for discretionary\nreview. People v. Davenport , 494 Mich. 875, 832\nN.W.2d 389, 390 (2013). C Mr. Davenport next sought relief in federal\ndistrict court, filing a habeas petition in the Western District of\nMichigan. Under AEDPA, however, a federal court may disturb a final\nstate-court conviction in only narrow circumstances. As relevant\nhere, the statute provides that, when a state court has already\nruled on the merits of the habeas petitioner’s claim, he must show\nthat decision was either (1) “contrary to” or an “unreasonable\napplication of ” clearly established federal law, as\ndetermined by the decisions of this Court, or (2) based on an\n“unreasonable determination of the facts” presented in the\nstate-court proceeding. 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d). The District Court found relief unwarranted\nunder this standard. The Michigan state courts had ruled on the\nmerits of Mr. Davenport’s claim of error. In doing so, they\ncorrectly identified this Court’s controlling harmless-error rule\nfrom Chapman . And their conclusions involved neither an\nunreasonable application of Chapman nor an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts. To the contrary, the District Court\nagreed with a Magistrate Judge’s assessment that the state-court\nrecord contained no evidence “that the jurors were influenced” by\nhis restraints and “overwhelming evidence of [Mr. Davenport’s]\nguilt.” Davenport v. MacLaren , 2016 WL 11262506, *4\n(WD Mich., Nov. 7, 2016); see also Davenport v. MacLaren , 2017 WL 4296808, *1–*2 (WD Mich., Sept. 26, 2017)\n(citing 28 U. S. C. § 2254(d)(1)). D After that loss, Mr. Davenport appealed to the\nSixth Circuit, where a divided panel reversed. Davenport v. MacLaren , 964 F.3d 448 (2020). Unlike the District Court, the Sixth Circuit\ndeclined to analyze the case under AEDPA. Instead, it held, only\nthis Court’s decision in Brecht v. Abrahamson governed its review. Handed down before Congress adopted AEDPA, Brecht sought to adapt Chapman ’s harmless-error rule,\ndeveloped for cases on direct appellate review, for use in federal\nhabeas proceedings. Brecht , 507 U. S., at 633–635.\nCiting the need to afford appropriate respect to final state-court\ndecisions that have already endured direct appeal, including\npotential review in this Court, Brecht effectively inverted Chapman ’s burden. 507 U. S., at 635. Rather than\nrequire the prosecution to prove that a constitutional trial error\nis harmless, Brecht held that a state prisoner seeking to\nchallenge his conviction in collateral federal proceedings must\nshow that the error had a “ ‘substantial and injurious effect\nor influence’ ” on the outcome of his trial. Id. , at\n637. Persuaded that Mr. Davenport could satisfy his burden under Brecht , the panel majority ordered Michigan to retry or\nrelease him promptly. 964 F. 3d, at 464–468. Judge Readler dissented. He argued that Brecht and AEDPA set forth independent tests, and that both\nmust be satisfied before habeas relief becomes permissible. In\nJudge Readler’s view, too, the District Court correctly rejected\nMr. Davenport’s petition under AEDPA because the state courts\nhearing his case had not acted contrary to, or unreasonably\napplied, this Court’s decisions. 964 F. 3d, at 469, 478. The Sixth Circuit denied rehearing en banc by a\nvote of 8 to 7. Davenport v. MacLaren , 975 F.3d 537\n(2020). Judges Griffin and Thapar issued dissenting opinions. They\nexpressed agreement with Judge Readler and observed that the panel\nmajority’s decision conflicted with those of other circuits where\npetitioners are required to satisfy both Brecht and AEDPA\nbefore becoming eligible for habeas relief. 975 F. 3d, at 552\n(Thapar, J., dissenting) (citing decisions from the Third, Seventh,\nTenth, and Eleventh Circuits). We granted Michigan’s petition for\ncertiorari to resolve the conflict in the federal courts of appeals\nabout the proper interaction between these two tests. 593\nU. S. ___ (2021). II When Congress supplies a constitutionally\nvalid rule of decision, federal courts must follow it. In AEDPA,\nCongress announced such a rule. It instructed that a federal court\n“ shall not . . . gran [ t ]” relief\nwith respect to a claim that has been adjudicated on the merits in\nstate court “ unless ” the state court’s decision was (1)\n“contrary to” or an “unreasonable application of ” clearly\nestablished federal law, as determined by the decisions of this\nCourt, or (2) based on an “unreasonable determination of the facts”\npresented in the state-court proceeding. § 2254(d) (emphasis\nadded). The upshot of these directions for our case is\nstraightforward. No one questions that a state court’s\nharmless-error determination qualifies as an adjudication on the\nmerits under AEDPA. See Davis v. Ayala , 576 U.S. 257,\n269 (2015); Fry v. Pliler , 551\nU.S. 112 , 119 (2007); Early v. Packer , 537 U.S.\n3 , 10–11 (2002) ( per curiam ). No one disputes that such\na decision exists here. Nor does Mr. Davenport pursue any claim to\nrelief under § 2254(d)(2). From this, it follows that he must\nsatisfy § 2254(d)(1) to secure federal habeas relief. To be\nsure, where Brecht is implicated a federal court must also\nensure a habeas petitioner has carried his burden under its terms\nbefore granting relief. But in cases like ours satisfying Brecht is only a necessary, not a sufficient, condition to\nrelief. AEDPA too must be satisfied. The Sixth Circuit erred in\nholding otherwise. A Some background helps explain this\narrangement. From the founding, Congress authorized federal courts\nto issue habeas writs to federal custodians. § 14, 1Stat.\n81–82. After the Civil War, Congress extended this authority,\nallowing federal courts to issue habeas writs to state custodians\nas well. See Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, § 1, 14Stat. 385.\nBut these statutes used permissive rather than mandatory language;\nfederal courts had the “power to” grant writs of habeas corpus in\ncertain circumstances. That same structure lives on in contemporary\nstatutes, which provide that federal courts “may” grant habeas\nrelief “as law and justice require.” 28 U. S. C.\n§§ 2241, 2243; Wright v. West , 505 U.S.\n277 , 285 (1992) (plurality opinion). Over the centuries, a number of writs of habeas\ncorpus evolved at common law to serve a number of different\nfunctions. See Ex parte Bollman , 4 Cranch 75, 97–98\n(1807); 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England\n129–131 (1768). But the most notable among these writs was that of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum , often called the “Great\nWrit.” Id. , at 131. When English monarchs jailed their\nsubjects summarily and indefinitely, common-law courts employed the\nwrit as a way to compel the crown to explain its actions—and, if\nnecessary, ensure adequate process, such as a trial, before\nallowing any further detention. See Petition of Right, 3 Car. 1,\nch.1, ¶¶ 5, 8 (1628). The Great Writ was, in this way, no less than\n“the instrument by which due process could be insisted upon.” Hamdi v. Rumsfeld , 542 U.S.\n507 , 555 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting). At the same time, even this writ had its limits.\nUsually, a prisoner could not use it to challenge a final judgment\nof conviction issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. See, e.g. , Opinion on the Writ of Habeas Corpus , Wilm. 77,\n88, 97 Eng. Rep. 29, 36 (K. B. 1758). If the point of the writ\nwas to ensure due process attended an individual’s confinement, a\ntrial was generally considered proof he had received just that.\nSee, e.g. , Bushell’s Case , Vaugh. 135, 142–143, 124\nEng. Rep. 1006, 1009–1010 (C. P. 1670). This traditional understanding extended from\nEngland to this country and persisted through much of our history.\nAsked to apply the Nation’s first habeas statute to a duly\nconvicted prisoner, Chief Justice Marshall invoked the common-law\nrule that a judgment of conviction after trial was “conclusive on\nall the world.” Ex parte Watkins , 3 Pet. 193, 202–203\n(1830). Acknowledging that Congress had authorized the Court to\n“inquire into the sufficiency of ” the cause of the\npetitioner’s detention, Marshall asked rhetorically, “is not that\njudgment in itself sufficient cause?” Id. , at 202\n(emphasis added); see also Ex parte Parks , 93 U.S.\n18 , 21–22 (1876); P. Bator, Finality in Criminal Law and\nFederal Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners, 76 Harv. L. Rev.\n441, 465–469 (1963) (Bator). If the answer was nearly always yes, an\nimportant exception existed in both English and American law: A\nhabeas court could grant relief if the court of conviction lacked\njurisdiction over the defendant or his offense. See Watkins ,\n3 Pet., at 202–203; Bator 471–472. A perceived “error in the\njudgment or proceedings, under and by virtue of which the party is\nimprisoned, constitute[d] no ground for” relief. Ex parte\nSiebold , 100\nU.S. 371 , 375 (1880). Instead, a habeas court could “examin[e]\nonly the power and authority of the court to act, not the\ncorrectness of its conclusions.” Harlan v. McGourin , 218 U.S.\n442 , 448 (1910). To be sure, the line between mere errors and\njurisdictional defects was not always a “luminous beacon” and it\nevolved over time. Bator 470; Edwards v. Vannoy , 593\nU. S. ___, ___ (2021) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (slip op., at\n5). But this Court generally sought to police the doctrine’s\nboundaries in cases involving federal and state prisoners\nalike.[ 1 ] By 1953, however, federal habeas practice began\nto take on a very different shape. That year in Brown v. Allen this Court held that a state-court judgment “is not res judicata ” in federal habeas proceedings with respect to\na petitioner’s federal constitutional claims. 344 U.S.\n443 , 458 (1953). A state court may reject the petitioner’s\nclaims after a fair hearing. No appellate court, including this\none, may see fit to reverse that final judgment. Yet still, Brown suggested, a federal district court approaching the\nsame case years later should be free to decide de novo whether the state-court proceedings “resulted in a satisfactory\nconclusion” and to issue habeas relief if that conclusion is found\nwanting. Id. , at 463; see also Wright , 505\nU. S., at 287–288 (plurality opinion). The traditional\ndistinction between jurisdictional defects and mere errors in\nadjudication no longer restrained federal habeas courts. Full-blown\nconstitutional error correction became the order of the day. This shift did not go unnoticed. Concurring only\nin the result, Justice Jackson contended that the Court’s decision\n“trivializ[ed] . . . the writ” and was inconsistent with\nthe presumption of finality that traditionally attached to criminal\nconvictions. Brown , 344 U. S., at 536, 543. He warned,\ntoo, that the Court’s ruling threatened “haystack[s]” of new habeas\npetitions—and that federal courts would struggle to identify the\nmeritorious “needle[s]” among them. Id. , at 537. Over the\nensuing years, that prediction proved prescient: Federal courts\nstruggled with an exploding caseload of habeas petitions from state\nprisoners. See, e.g. , Schneckloth v. Bustamonte , 412 U.S.\n218 , 274, n. 37 (1973) (Powell, J., concurring) (“In 1971\n. . . state prisoners alone filed 7,949 petitions for\nhabeas in federal district courts, over 14 times the number filed\nwhen Mr. Justice Jackson voiced his misgivings”); B. Garrett\n& L. Kovarsky, Federal Habeas Corpus 135–136 (2013)\n(documenting the rise of habeas filings by state\nprisoners).[ 2 ] B Eventually, this Court responded to the\npost- Brown habeas boom by devising new rules aimed at\nseparating the meritorious needles from the growing haystack. The\nhabeas statutes themselves provided the starting place for these\nefforts. Recall that Congress invested federal courts with\ndiscretion when it comes to supplying habeas relief—providing that\nthey “may” (not must) grant writs of habeas corpus, and that they\nshould do so only as “law and justice require.”\n28 U. S. C. §§ 2241, 2243. This language, the\nCourt recognized, serves as “authorization to adjust the scope of\nthe writ in accordance with equitable and prudential\nconsiderations.” Danforth v. Minnesota , 552 U.S.\n264 , 278 (2008); see also Withrow v. Williams , 507 U.S.\n680 , 716 (1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part). Foremost among those considerations is the States’\n“powerful and legitimate interest in punishing the guilty.” Calderon v. Thompson , 523 U.S.\n538 , 556 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). Granting\nhabeas relief to a state prisoner “intrudes on state sovereignty to\na degree matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.” Harrington v. Richter , 562 U.S.\n86 , 103 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Exercising its equitable discretion, and\ninformed by these concerns, the Court began to develop doctrines\n“aimed at returning the Great Writ closer to its historic office.” Edwards , 593 U. S., at ___ (Gorsuch, J., concurring)\n(slip op., at 8). The Court established procedural-default\nstandards to prevent petitioners from evading independent and\nadequate state-law grounds sustaining their convictions. Wainwright v. Sykes , 433 U.S.\n72 , 86–87 (1977). The Court held that some claims are not\ncognizable in federal habeas if state courts provide a mechanism\nfor review. Stone v. Powell , 428\nU.S. 465 , 494–495 (1976). The Court also applied new rules to\nprevent cycles of repetitive filings. McCleskey v. Zant , 499 U.S.\n467 , 486–493 (1991). Brecht was part of this effort. In Chapman , this Court held that, when a defendant demonstrates\non direct appeal that a constitutional error occurred at his trial,\nhis conviction cannot stand unless the government proves the\nerror’s harmlessness “beyond a reasonable doubt.” 386 U. S.,\nat 24. In Brecht , the Court resolved that this same standard\nwas inappropriate for use in federal habeas review of final\nstate-court judgments. 507 U. S., at 633–634. Instead, the\nCourt reasoned, a state prisoner should not receive federal “habeas\nrelief based on trial error unless” he can show the error had a\n“substantial and injurious effect or influence” on the verdict. Id. , at 637 (internal quotation marks omitted). In reaching\nits judgment, the Court stressed that undoing a final state-court\njudgment is an “extraordinary remedy,” reserved for only\n“ ‘extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice\nsystem’ ” and different in kind from providing relief on\ndirect appeal. Id. , at 633–634. To allow a federal habeas\ncourt to set aside a conviction based on nothing more than\n“speculation that the defendant was prejudiced by trial error”\nwould be to give short shrift to the State’s “sovereign interes[t]”\nin its final judgment. Calderon v. Coleman , 525 U.S.\n141, 146 (1998) ( per curiam ). Much as the Court had “filled\nthe gaps of the habeas statute with respect to other matters,” it\nfound it “necessary to do so” again, in a by-now familiar exercise\nof its equitable discretion. Brecht , 507 U. S., at\n633. C Three years after Brecht , and\napparently finding the Court’s equitable doctrines insufficient,\nCongress introduced its own reforms in AEDPA. In many ways, the statute represented a sea\nchange in federal habeas law. As we have seen, Congress instructed\nthat, if a state court has adjudicated the petitioner’s claim on\nthe merits, a federal court “shall not” grant habeas relief\n“unless” certain conditions are satisfied. § 2254(d). Some of\nthese conditions were new to the law at the time of their adoption;\nall are demanding. See Richter , 562 U. S., at 102. Still, Congress did not wash away everything\nthat came before. While AEDPA announced certain new conditions to\nrelief, it did not guarantee relief upon their satisfaction.\nInstead, Congress left intact the equitable discretion\ntraditionally invested in federal courts by preexisting habeas\nstatutes. So even a petitioner who prevails under AEDPA must still\ntoday persuade a federal habeas court that “law and justice\nrequire” relief. § 2243. See Fry , 551 U. S., at\n119; Horn v. Banks , 536 U.S.\n266 , 272 (2002) ( per curiam ). And whatever else those\ninquiries involve, they continue to require federal habeas courts\nto apply this Court’s precedents governing the appropriate exercise\nof equitable discretion—including Brecht . See Banks ,\n536 U. S., at 272; Johnson v. Acevedo , 572 F.3d\n398, 404 (CA7 2009); see also Edwards , 593 U. S., at\n___, n. 5 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (slip op., at 9,\nn. 5). Today, then, a federal court must deny relief to a state habeas petitioner who fails to satisfy either\nthis Court’s equitable precedents or AEDPA. But to grant relief, a court must find that the petitioner has cleared both\ntests. The Sixth Circuit erred when it held Mr. Davenport to just\none of these burdens. It granted relief after finding for him on Brecht . But it failed to ask the further question whether he\nsatisfied AEDPA. In doing so, the court disregarded Congress’s\ninstruction that habeas relief “shall not be granted” unless\nAEDPA’s terms are satisfied. § 2254(d). III Mr. Davenport advances two arguments—one\nlogical, one doctrinal—in defense of the Sixth Circuit’s decision.\nWe consider them in turn. A Mr",

WISCONSIN ELECTIONS COMMISSION, et al. on application for stay and injunctive\nrelief [March 23, 2022] Per Curiam. Because of population shifts revealed by the\n2020 decennial census, Wisconsin’s State Assembly and Senate\ndistricts are no longer equally apportioned. The Wisconsin\nLegislature passed new maps to fix the problem, but the Governor\nvetoed them. At an impasse, the legislature and the Governor turned\nto the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which had already agreed to hear an\noriginal action brought by a group of voters seeking to remedy the\nmalapportionment. Rather than attempt to draw new maps itself, the\ncourt invited the parties and intervenors—including the legislature\nand the Governor—to propose maps that complied with the State\nConstitution, the Federal Constitution, and the Voting Rights Act\nof 1965 (VRA), 79Stat. 437, as amended, 52 U. S. C.\n§10301 et seq ., and that otherwise minimized changes from\nthe current maps. On March 3, the court issued a decision\nselecting the Assembly and Senate maps that the Governor had\nproposed. Johnson v. Wisconsin Elections Comm’n , 2022\nWI 14, ___ Wis. 2d ___, ___ N. W. 2d ___. (Because\nthe State Constitution requires three Assembly districts to be\nnested within each Senate district, the court analyzed and selected\nthe maps as a unit. Id. , ¶26.) The Governor’s Assembly map\nintentionally created seven majority-black districts—one more than\nthe current map.[ 1 ] The\nGovernor argued that the addition of a seventh majority-black\ndistrict was necessary for compliance with the VRA. In adopting the\nGovernor’s map, the court explained: “[W]e cannot say for certain\non this record that seven majority-Black assembly districts are\nrequired by the VRA.” Id. , ¶47. It nevertheless concluded\nthat the Governor’s map complied with the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment because there were “good reasons” to\nthink that the VRA “may” require the additional majority-black\ndistrict. Id. , ¶50. The legislature and the voters who initiated the\nstate-court proceeding now seek relief from that decision. They\nargue that the court selected race-based maps without sufficient\njustification, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. They\nask this Court either to grant an emergency stay or to construe\ntheir application as a petition for certiorari and reverse the\ndecision below. We agree that the court committed legal error in\nits application of decisions of this Court regarding the\nrelationship between the constitutional guarantee of equal\nprotection and the VRA. We accordingly construe the application for\nstay presented to Justice Barrett and by her referred to the Court\nas a petition for certiorari, grant the petition, reverse the\nimposition of the Governor’s State Assembly and Senate maps, and\nremand to the Wisconsin Supreme Court for proceedings not\ninconsistent with this opinion. Summarily correcting the error\ngives the court sufficient time to adopt maps consistent with the\ntimetable for Wisconsin’s August 9th primary election. *  *  * Under the Equal Protection Clause, districting\nmaps that sort voters on the basis of race “ ‘are by their\nvery nature odious.’ ” Shaw v. Reno , 509 U.S.\n630 , 643 (1993). Such laws “cannot be upheld unless they are\nnarrowly tailored to achieving a compelling state interest.” Miller v. Johnson , 515 U.S.\n900 , 904 (1995). We have assumed that complying with the VRA is\na compelling interest. Cooper v. Harris , 581\nU. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 2). And we have held that\nif race is the predominant factor motivating the placement of\nvoters in or out of a particular district, the State bears the\nburden of showing that the design of that district withstands\nstrict scrutiny. Ibid. Thus, our precedents hold that a\nState can satisfy strict scrutiny if it proves that its race-based\nsorting of voters is narrowly tailored to comply with the VRA. Ibid. A State violates §2 of the VRA “if, based on the\ntotality of circumstances, it is shown that the political processes\nleading to nomination or election in the State or political\nsubdivision are not equally open to participation by members of [a\nminority group] in that its members have less opportunity than\nother members of the electorate to participate in the political\nprocess and to elect representatives of their choice.” 52\nU. S. C. §10301(b). We have construed §2 to prohibit the\ndistribution of minority voters into districts in a way that\ndilutes their voting power. See Thornburg v. Gingles , 478 U.S.\n30 , 46–51 (1986). In Gingles , we provided a framework\nfor demonstrating a violation of that sort. First, three\n“preconditions” must be shown: (1) The minority group must be\nsufficiently large and compact to constitute a majority in a\nreasonably configured district, (2) the minority group must be\npolitically cohesive, and (3) a majority group must vote\nsufficiently as a bloc to enable it to usually defeat the minority\ngroup’s preferred candidate. Id. , at 50–51. If the preconditions are established, a court\nconsiders the totality of circumstances to determine “whether the\npolitical process is equally open to minority voters.” Id. ,\nat 79; see also Johnson v. De Grandy , 512 U.S.\n997 , 1011–1012 (1994) (satisfying the Gingles preconditions is necessary but not sufficient to show a §2\nviolation; “courts must also examine other evidence in the totality\nof circumstances”). We have identified as relevant to the totality\nanalysis several factors enumerated in the Senate Report on the\n1982 amendments to the VRA, as well as “whether the number of\ndistricts in which the minority group forms an effective majority\nis roughly proportional to its share of the population in the\nrelevant area.” League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry , 548 U.S.\n399 , 426 (2006) ( LULAC ). We said in Cooper that when a State\ninvokes §2 to justify race-based districting, “it must show (to\nmeet the ‘narrow tailoring’ requirement) that it had ‘a strong\nbasis in evidence’ for concluding that the statute required its\naction.” 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3). The Wisconsin\nSupreme Court concluded that the Governor’s intentional addition of\na seventh majority-black district triggered the Equal Protection\nClause and that Cooper ’s strict-scrutiny test must\naccordingly be satisfied. Accepting those conclusions, we hold that\nthe court erred in its efforts to apply Cooper ’s\nunderstanding of what the Equal Protection Clause requires. It is not clear whether the court viewed the\nGovernor or itself as the state mapmaker who must satisfy strict\nscrutiny, but the court’s application of Cooper was flawed\neither way. If the former, the Governor failed to carry his burden.\nHis main explanation for drawing the seventh majority-black\ndistrict was that there is now a sufficiently large and compact\npopulation of black residents to fill it, Brief for\nIntervenor-Respondent Evers in Johnson v. Wisconsin\nElections Comm’n , No. 2021AP1450–OA (Wis. Sup. Ct., Dec.\n15, 2021), p. 14—apparently embracing just the sort of\nuncritical majority-minority district maximization that we have\nexpressly rejected. De Grandy , 512 U. S., at 1017\n(“Failure to maximize cannot be the measure of §2”). He provided\nalmost no other evidence or analysis supporting his claim that the\nVRA required the seven majority-black districts that he drew. See\n2022 WI 14, ¶¶90–91, 103–107 (Ziegler, C. J., dissenting).\nStrict scrutiny requires much more. See Abbott v. Perez , 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 40)\n(“[W]here we have accepted a State’s ‘good reasons’ for using race\nin drawing district lines, the State made a strong showing of a\npre-enactment analysis with justifiable conclusions”). If the\nWisconsin Supreme Court was reviewing whether the Governor\nsatisfied strict scrutiny, it erred by adopting his maps. If, on the other hand, the court sought to\nshoulder strict scrutiny’s burden itself, it fared little better. First , it misunderstood Cooper ’s inquiry. The court\nbelieved that it had to conclude only that the VRA might support race-based districting—not that the statute required it.\nSee 2022 WI 14, ¶¶47, 50 (“[W]e cannot say for certain on this\nrecord that seven majority-Black assembly districts are required by\nthe VRA,” but “we see good reasons to conclude a seventh\nmajority-Black assembly district may be required” (emphasis\nadded)). Our precedent instructs otherwise. Thus in Cooper we explained, for example, that “race-based districting is narrowly\ntailored . . . if a State had ‘good reasons’ for thinking\nthat the Act demanded such steps.” 581 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 12) (emphasis added). And we concluded that\n“experience gave the State no reason to think that the VRA required ” it to move voters based on race. Id. , at\n___ (slip op., at 14) (emphasis added). That principle grew out of\nthe more general proposition that “the institution that makes the\nracial distinction must have had a ‘strong basis in evidence’ to\nconclude that remedial action was necessary , ‘ before it embarks on an affirmative-action program.’ ” Shaw v. Hunt , 517 U.S.\n899 , 910 (1996) (some emphasis added). To be sure, we said in Cooper that States\nhave “ ‘breathing room’ ” to make reasonable mistakes; we\nwill not fault a State just because its “compliance measures\n. . . may prove, in perfect hindsight, not to have been\nneeded.” 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3). But that “leeway”\ndoes not allow a State to adopt a racial gerrymander that the State\ndoes not, at the time of imposition, “judg[e] necessary under a\nproper interpretation of the VRA.” Id. , at ___ (slip op., at\n17). Second , the court’s analysis of Gingles ’ preconditions fell short of our standards. As we\nexplained in Cooper , “[t]o have a strong basis in evidence\nto conclude that §2 demands . . . race-based steps, the\nState must carefully evaluate whether a plaintiff could establish\nthe Gingles preconditions . . . in a new district\ncreated without those measures.” 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 15). Rather than carefully evaluating evidence at the district\nlevel, the court improperly relied on generalizations to reach the\nconclusion that the preconditions were satisfied. See id. ,\nat ___, n. 5 (slip op., at 16, n. 5) (a “generalized\nconclusion fails to meaningfully . . . address the\nrelevant local question” whether the preconditions would be\nsatisfied as to each district). The court’s entire discussion of the first\nprecondition was to say that “it is undisputed” and “the parties’\nsubmissions demonstrate” that seven sufficiently large and compact\nmajority-black districts could be drawn. 2022 WI 14, ¶43.\nSimilarly, its discussion of the second precondition consisted of\nnothing but the statement that “[e]xperts from multiple parties\nanalyzed voting trends and concluded political cohesion existed; no\nparty disagreed.” Id. , ¶44. And while the court did cite one\nspecific expert report for the third precondition—calculating,\nbased on eight previous races, how often white voters in the\nMilwaukee area defeat the preferred candidate of black voters—it\nmade virtually no effort to parse that data at the district level\nor respond to criticisms of the expert’s analysis. Id. , ¶45;\nsee id. , ¶¶108–111 (Ziegler, C. J.,\ndissenting).[ 2 ] Third , the court improperly reduced Gingles ’ totality-of-circumstances analysis to a single\nfactor. The court acknowledged the Senate factors but concluded\nthat they had no role to play in its analysis. 2022 WI 14, ¶46, and\nn. 28. Instead, it focused exclusively on proportionality. See id. , ¶¶46–50. We rejected just that approach in De\nGrandy , explaining that “[n]o single statistic provides courts\nwith a shortcut to determine whether a set of single-member\ndistricts unlawfully dilutes minority voting strength.” 512\nU. S., at 1020–1021; see also id. , at 1026 (O’Connor,\nJ., concurring) (“The Court . . . makes clear that\nproportionality is never dispositive. Lack of proportionality can\nnever by itself prove dilution, for courts must always carefully\nand searchingly review the totality of the circumstances”). The question that our VRA precedents ask and the\ncourt failed to answer is whether a race-neutral alternative that\ndid not add a seventh majority-black district would deny black\nvoters equal political opportunity. Answering that question\nrequires an “ ‘ “intensely local appraisal” ’ of the\nchallenged district.” LULAC , 548 U. S., at 437. When\nthe Wisconsin Supreme Court endeavored to undertake a full\nstrict-scrutiny analysis, it did not do so properly under our\nprecedents, and its judgment cannot stand. *  *  * The judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin\nis reversed as to the selection of the Governor’s State Assembly\nand Senate maps, and the case is remanded for further proceedings\nnot inconsistent with this opinion. On remand, the court is free to\ntake additional evidence if it prefers to reconsider the Governor’s\nmaps rather than choose from among the other submissions. Any new\nanalysis, however, must comply with our equal protection\njurisprudence. It is so ordered. Notes 1 The Governor’s map\naccomplished this addition by reducing the black voting-age\npopulation in the other six majority-black districts. The black\nvoting-age populations in the Governor’s seven districts all\ncluster between 50.1% and 51.4%, compared to the current six\ndistricts’ range of 51% to 62%. See 2022 WI 14, ¶87 (Ziegler,\nC. J., dissenting). 2 That sole piece of cited\nrecord evidence came from an intervenor who argued that the\nGovernor’s map violated the VRA. See 2022 WI 14, ¶¶91, 112\n(Ziegler, C. J., dissenting); Response Brief for\nIntervenor-Petitioner Black Leaders Organizing for Communities\net al. in Johnson v. Wisconsin Elections Comm’n ,\nNo. 2021AP1450–OA (Wis. Sup. Ct., Dec. 30, 2021),\npp. 7–20. The court did not acknowledge or respond to that\nargument.",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus ALLEN, ALABAMA SECRETARY OF STATE, et al. v . MILLIGAN et al. appeal from the united states district court\nfor the northern district of alabama No. 21–1086. Argued October 4, 2022—Decided\nJune 8, 2023[ 1 ] The issue presented is whether the districting\nplan adopted by the State of Alabama for its 2022 congressional\nelections likely violated §2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52\nU. S. C. §10301. As originally enacted in 1965, §2 of the\nAct tracked the language of the Fifteenth Amendment, providing that\n“[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be\ndenied or abridged . . . on account of race, color, or\nprevious condition of servitude.” In City of Mobile v. Bolden , 446 U.S.\n55 , this Court held that the Fifteenth Amendment—and thus\n§2—prohibits States from acting with a “racially discriminatory\nmotivation” or an “invidious purpose” to discriminate, but it does\nnot prohibit laws that are discriminatory only in effect. Id. , at 61–65 (plurality opinion). Criticism followed, with\nmany viewing Mobile ’s intent test as not sufficiently\nprotective of voting rights. But others believed that adoption of\nan effects test would inevitably require a focus on\nproportionality, calling voting laws into question whenever a\nminority group won fewer seats in the legislature than its share of\nthe population. Congress ultimately resolved this debate in 1982,\nreaching a bipartisan compromise that amended §2 to incorporate\nboth an effects test and a robust disclaimer that “nothing” in §2\n“establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected\nin numbers equal to their proportion in the population.”\n§10301(b). In 1992, §2 litigation challenging the State\nof Alabama’s then-existing districting map resulted in the State’s\nfirst majority-black district and, subsequently, the State’s first\nblack Representative since 1877. Alabama’s congressional map has\nremained remarkably similar since that litigation. Following the\n2020 decennial census, a group of plaintiffs led by Alabama\nlegislator Bobby Singleton sued the State, arguing that the State’s\npopulation growth rendered the existing congressional map\nmalapportioned and racially gerrymandered in violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause. While litigation was proceeding, the Alabama\nLegislature’s Committee on Reapportionment drew a new districting\nmap that would reflect the distribution of the prior decade’s\npopulation growth across the State. The resulting map largely\nresembled the 2011 map on which it was based and similarly produced\nonly one district in which black voters constituted a majority.\nThat new map was signed into law as HB1. Three groups of Alabama citizens brought suit\nseeking to stop Alabama’s Secretary of State from conducting\ncongressional elections under HB1. One group ( Caster plaintiffs) challenged HB1 as invalid under §2. Another group\n( Milligan plaintiffs) brought claims under §2 and the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. And a third group\n(the Singleton plaintiffs) amended the complaint in their\nongoing litigation to challenge HB1 as a racial gerrymander under\nthe Equal Protection Clause. A three-judge District Court was\nconvened, and the Singleton and Milligan actions were\nconsolidated before that District Court for purposes of preliminary\ninjunction proceedings, while Caster proceeded before one of\nthe judges on a parallel track. After an extensive hearing, the\nDistrict Court concluded in a 227-page opinion that the question\nwhether HB1 likely violated §2 was not “close.” The Court\npreliminarily enjoined Alabama from using HB1 in forthcoming\nelections. The same relief was ordered in Caster. Held : The Court affirms the\nDistrict Court’s determination that plaintiffs demonstrated a\nreasonable likelihood of success on their claim that HB1 violates\n§2. Pp. 9–22, 25–34. (a) The District Court faithfully applied\nthis Court’s precedents in concluding that HB1 likely violates §2.\nPp. 9–15. (1) This Court first addressed the 1982\namendments to §2 in Thornburg v. Gingles , 478 U.S.\n30 , and has for the last 37 years evaluated §2 claims using the Gingles framework. Gingles described the “essence of\na §2 claim” as when “a certain electoral law, practice, or\nstructure interacts with social and historical conditions to cause\nan inequality in the opportunities enjoyed by black and white\nvoters.” Id. , at 47. That occurs where an “electoral\nstructure operates to minimize or cancel out” minority voters’\n“ability to elect their preferred candidates.” Id. , at 48.\nSuch a risk is greatest “where minority and majority voters\nconsistently prefer different candidates” and where minority voters\nare submerged in a majority voting population that “regularly\ndefeat[s]” their choices. Ibid. To prove a §2 violation under Gingles ,\nplaintiffs must satisfy three “preconditions.” Id. , at 50.\nFirst, the “minority group must be sufficiently large and\n[geographically] compact to constitute a majority in a reasonably\nconfigured district.” Wisconsin Legislature v. Wisconsin\nElections Comm’n , 595 U. S. ___, ___ ( per curiam ).\n“Second, the minority group must be able to show that it is\npolitically cohesive.” Gingles , 478 U. S., at 51. And\nthird, “the minority must be able to demonstrate that the white\nmajority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . .\nto defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.” Ibid. A\nplaintiff who demonstrates the three preconditions must then show,\nunder the “totality of circumstances,” that the challenged\npolitical process is not “equally open” to minority voters. Id. , at 45–46. The totality of circumstances inquiry\nrecognizes that application of the Gingles factors is fact\ndependent and requires courts to conduct “an intensely local\nappraisal” of the electoral mechanism at issue, as well as a\n“searching practical evaluation of the past and present reality.” Id. , at 79. Congress has not disturbed the Court’s\nunderstanding of §2 as Gingles construed it nearly 40 years\nago. Pp. 9–11. (2) The extensive record in these cases\nsupports the District Court’s conclusion that plaintiffs’ §2 claim\nwas likely to succeed under Gingles . As to the first Gingles precondition, the District Court correctly found\nthat black voters could constitute a majority in a second district\nthat was “reasonably configured.” The plaintiffs adduced eleven\nillustrative districting maps that Alabama could enact, at least\none of which contained two majority-black districts that comported\nwith traditional districting criteria. With respect to the\ncompactness criteria, for example, the District Court explained\nthat the maps submitted by one expert “perform[ed] generally better\non average than” did HB1, and contained no “bizarre shapes, or any\nother obvious irregularities.” Plaintiffs’ maps contained equal\npopulations, were contiguous, and respected existing political\nsubdivisions. Indeed, some of plaintiffs’ proposed maps split the\nsame (or even fewer) county lines than the State’s. The Court finds unpersuasive the State’s\nargument that plaintiffs’ maps were not reasonably configured\nbecause they failed to keep together the Gulf Coast region. Even if\nthat region is a traditional community of interest, the District\nCourt found the evidence insufficient to sustain Alabama’s argument\nthat no legitimate reason could exist to split it. Moreover, the\nDistrict Court found that plaintiffs’ maps were reasonably\nconfigured because they joined together a different community of\ninterest called the Black Belt—a community with a high proportion\nof similarly situated black voters who share a lineal connection to\n“the many enslaved people brought there to work in the antebellum\nperiod.” As to the second and third Gingles preconditions, the District Court determined that there was “no\nserious dispute that Black voters are politically cohesive, nor\nthat the challenged districts’ white majority votes sufficiently as\na bloc to usually defeat Black voters’ preferred candidate.” The\ncourt noted that, “on average, Black voters supported their\ncandidates of choice with 92.3% of the vote” while “white voters\nsupported Black-preferred candidates with 15.4% of the vote.” Even\nAlabama’s expert conceded “that the candidates preferred by white\nvoters in the areas that he looked at regularly defeat the\ncandidates preferred by Black voters.” Finally, the District Court\nconcluded that plaintiffs had carried their burden at the totality\nof circumstances stage given the racial polarization of elections\nin Alabama, where “Black Alabamians enjoy virtually zero success in\nstatewide elections” and where “Alabama’s extensive history of\nrepugnant racial and voting-related discrimination is undeniable\nand well documented.” The Court sees no reason to disturb the\nDistrict Court’s careful factual findings, which are subject to\nclear error review and have gone unchallenged by Alabama in any\nevent. Pp. 11–15. (b) The Court declines to remake its §2\njurisprudence in line with Alabama’s “race-neutral benchmark”\ntheory. (1) The Court rejects the State’s\ncontention that adopting the race-neutral benchmark as the point of\ncomparison in §2 cases would best match the text of the VRA.\nSection 2 requires political processes in a State to be “equally\nopen” such that minority voters do not “have less opportunity than\nother members of the electorate to participate in the political\nprocess and to elect representatives of their choice.” §10301(b).\nUnder the Court’s precedents, a district is not equally open when\nminority voters face—unlike their majority peers—bloc voting along\nracial lines, arising against the backdrop of substantial racial\ndiscrimination within the State, that renders a minority vote\nunequal to a vote by a nonminority voter. Alabama would ignore this\nprecedent in favor of a rationale that a State’s map cannot\n“abridge[ ]” a person’s right to vote “on account of race” if\nthe map resembles a sufficient number of race-neutral alternatives.\nBut this Court’s cases have consistently focused, for purposes of\nlitigation, on the specific illustrative maps that a plaintiff\nadduces. Deviation from that map shows it is possible that\nthe State’s map has a disparate effect on account of race. The\nremainder of the Gingles test helps determine whether that\npossibility is reality by looking to polarized voting preferences\nand the frequency of racially discriminatory actions taken by the\nState. The Court declines to adopt Alabama’s\ninterpretation of §2, which would “revise and reformulate the Gingles threshold inquiry that has been the baseline of [the\nCourt’s] §2 jurisprudence” for decades. Bartlett v. Strickland , 556 U.S.\n1 , 16 (plurality opinion). Pp. 15–18. (2) Alabama argues that absent a\nbenchmark, the Gingles framework ends up requiring the\nracial proportionality in districting that §2(b) forbids. The\nCourt’s decisions implementing §2 demonstrate, however, that when\nproperly applied, the Gingles framework itself imposes\nmeaningful constraints on proportionality. See Shaw v. Reno , 509 U.S.\n630 , 633–634; Miller v. Johnson , 515 U.S.\n900 , 906; Bush v . Vera, 517\nU.S. 952 , 957 (plurality opinion). In Shaw v. Reno , for example, the Court considered the permissibility\nof a second majority-minority district in North Carolina, which at\nthe time had 12 seats in the U. S. House of Representatives\nand a 20% black voting age population. 509 U. S., at 633–634.\nThough North Carolina believed §2 required a second\nmajority-minority district, the Court found North Carolina’s\napproach an impermissible racial gerrymander because the State had\n“concentrated a dispersed minority population in a single district\nby disregarding traditional districting principles such as\ncompactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions.” Id. , at 647. The Court’s decisions in Bush and Shaw similarly declined to require additional\nmajority-minority districts under §2 where those districts did not\nsatisfy traditional districting principles. The Court recognizes that reapportionment\nremains primarily the duty and responsibility of the States, not\nthe federal courts. Section 2 thus never requires adoption of\ndistricts that violate traditional redistricting principles and\ninstead limits judicial intervention to “those instances of\nintensive racial politics” where the “excessive role [of race] in\nthe electoral process . . . den[ies] minority voters\nequal opportunity to participate.” S. Rep. No. 97–417, pp. 33–34.\nPp. 18–22. (c) To apply its race-neutral benchmark\nin practice, Alabama would require plaintiffs to make at least\nthree showings. First, Alabama would require §2 plaintiffs to show\nthat the illustrative maps adduced for the first Gingles precondition are not based on race. Alabama would next graft onto\n§2 a requirement that plaintiffs demonstrate, at the totality of\ncircumstances stage, that the State’s enacted plan contains fewer\nmajority-minority districts than what an “average” race-neutral\nplan would contain. And finally, Alabama would have plaintiffs\nprove that any deviation between the State’s plan and a\nrace-neutral plan is explainable “only” by race. The Court declines\nto adopt any of these novel requirements. Here, Alabama contends that because HB1\nsufficiently “resembles” the “race-neutral” maps created by the\nState’s experts—all of which lack two majority-black districts—HB1\ndoes not violate §2. Alabama’s reliance on the maps created by its\nexperts Dr. Duchin and Dr. Imai is misplaced because those maps do\nnot accurately represent the districting process in Alabama.\nRegardless, the map-comparison test that Alabama proposes is flawed\nin its fundamentals. Neither the text of §2 nor the fraught debate\nthat produced it suggests that “equal access” to the fundamental\nright of voting turns on technically complicated computer\nsimulations. Further, while Alabama has repeatedly emphasized that\nHB1 cannot have violated §2 because none of plaintiffs’ two million\nodd maps contained more than one majority-minority district, that\n(albeit very big) number is close to irrelevant in practice, where\nexperts estimate the possible number of Alabama districting maps\nnumbers is at least in the trillion trillions. Alabama would also require plaintiffs to\ndemonstrate that any deviations between the State’s enacted plan\nand race-neutral alternatives “can be explained only by\nracial discrimination.” Brief for Alabama 44 (emphasis added). But\nthe Court’s precedents and the legislative compromise struck in the\n1982 amendments clearly rejected treating discriminatory intent as\na requirement for liability under §2. Pp. 22, 25–30. (d) The Court disagrees with Alabama’s\nassertions that the Court should stop applying §2 in cases like\nthese because the text of §2 does not apply to single-member\nredistricting and because §2 is unconstitutional as the District\nCourt applied it here. Alabama’s understanding of §2 would require\nabandoning four decades of the Court’s §2 precedents. The Court has\nunanimously held that §2 and the Gingles framework apply to\nclaims challenging single-member districts. Growe v. Emison , 507 U.S.\n25 , 40. As Congress is undoubtedly aware of the Court’s\nconstruction of §2 to apply to districting challenges, statutory stare decisis counsels staying the course until and unless\nCongress acts. In any event, the statutory text supports the\nconclusion that §2 applies to single-member districts. Indeed, the\ncontentious debates in Congress about proportionality would have\nmade little sense if §2’s coverage was as limited as Alabama\ncontends. The Court similarly rejects Alabama’s argument\nthat §2 as applied to redistricting is unconstitutional under the\nFifteenth Amendment. The Court held over 40 years ago “that, even\nif §1 of the [Fifteenth] Amendment prohibits only purposeful\ndiscrimination,” City of Rome v. United States , 446 U.S.\n156 , 173, the VRA’s “ban on electoral changes that are\ndiscriminatory in effect is an appropriate method of promoting the\npurposes of the Fifteenth Amendment,” id., at 177. Alabama’s\ncontention that the Fifteenth Amendment does not authorize\nrace-based redistricting as a remedy for §2 violations similarly\nfails. The Court is not persuaded by Alabama’s arguments that §2 as\ninterpreted in Gingles exceeds the remedial authority of\nCongress. The Court’s opinion does not diminish or\ndisregard the concern that §2 may impermissibly elevate race in the\nallocation of political power within the States. Instead, the Court\nsimply holds that a faithful application of precedent and a fair\nreading of the record do not bear those concerns out here. Pp.\n30–34. Nos. 21–1086, 582 F. Supp. 3d 924, and\n21–1087, affirmed. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, except as to Part III–B–1.

MARCUS CASTER, et al. on writ of certiorari before judgment to the\nunited states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit [June 8, 2023] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, except as to Part III–B–1.[ 1 ]* In January 2022, a three-judge District Court\nsitting in Alabama preliminarily enjoined the State from using the\ndistricting plan it had recently adopted for the 2022 congressional\nelections, finding that the plan likely violated Section 2 of the\nVoting Rights Act, 52 U. S. C. §10301. This Court stayed\nthe District Court’s order pending further review. 595 U. S.\n___ (2022). After conducting that review, we now affirm. I A Shortly after the Civil War, Congress passed\nand the States ratified the Fifteenth Amendment, providing that\n“[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be\ndenied or abridged . . . on account of race, color, or\nprevious condition of servitude.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 15, §1.\nIn the century that followed, however, the Amendment proved little\nmore than a parchment promise. Jim Crow laws like literacy tests,\npoll taxes, and “good-morals” requirements abounded, South Carolina v. Katzenbach , 383 U.S.\n301 , 312–313 (1966), “render[ing] the right to vote illusory\nfor blacks,” Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder , 557 U.S.\n193 , 220–221 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part). Congress stood up to little of it; “[t]he\nfirst century of congressional enforcement of the [Fifteenth]\nAmendment . . . can only be regarded as a failure.” Id. , at 197 (majority opinion). That changed in 1965. Spurred by the Civil\nRights movement, Congress enacted and President Johnson signed into\nlaw the Voting Rights Act. 79Stat. 437, as amended, 52\nU. S. C. §10301 et seq. The Act “create[d]\nstringent new remedies for voting discrimination,” attempting to\nforever “banish the blight of racial discrimination in voting.” Katzenbach , 383 U. S., at 308. By 1981, in only sixteen\nyears’ time, many considered the VRA “the most successful civil\nrights statute in the history of the Nation.” S. Rep. No. 97–417,\np. 111 (1982) (Senate Report). These cases concern Section 2 of that Act. In\nits original form, “§2 closely tracked the language of the\n[Fifteenth] Amendment” and, as a result, had little independent\nforce. Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee , 594\nU. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 3).[ 2 ] Our leading case on §2 at the time was City\nof Mobile v. Bolden , which involved a claim by black\nvoters that the City’s at-large election system effectively\nexcluded them from participating in the election of city\ncommissioners. 446 U.S.\n55 (1980). The commission had three seats, black voters\ncomprised one-third of the City’s population, but no\nblack-preferred candidate had ever won election. The Court ruled against the plaintiffs. The\nFifteenth Amendment—and thus §2—prohibits States from acting with a\n“racially discriminatory motivation” or an “invidious purpose” to\ndiscriminate. Id. , at 61–65 (plurality opinion). But it does\nnot prohibit laws that are discriminatory only in effect. Ibid. The Mobile plaintiffs could “register and vote\nwithout hindrance”—“their freedom to vote ha[d] not been denied or\nabridged by anyone.” Id. , at 65. The fact that they happened\nto lose frequently was beside the point. Nothing the City had done\n“purposeful[ly] exclu[ded]” them “from participati[ng] in the\nelection process.” Id. , at 64. Almost immediately after it was decided, Mobile “produced an avalanche of criticism, both in the\nmedia and within the civil rights community.” T. Boyd & S.\nMarkman, The 1982 Amendments to the Voting Rights Act: A\nLegislative History, 40 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 1347, 1355 (1983)\n(Boyd & Markman). The New York Times wrote that the decision\nrepresented “the biggest step backwards in civil rights to come\nfrom the Nixon Court.” N. Y. Times, Apr. 23, 1980, p. A22. And\nthe Washington Post described Mobile as a “major defeat for\nblacks and other minorities fighting electoral schemes that exclude\nthem from office.” Washington Post, Apr. 23, 1980, p. A5. By\nfocusing on discriminatory intent and ignoring disparate effect,\ncritics argued, the Court had abrogated “the standard used by the\ncourts to determine whether [racial] discrimination existed\n. . . : Whether such discrimination existed.” It’s\nResults That Count, Philadelphia Inquirer, Mar. 3, 1982,\np. 8–A. But Mobile had its defenders, too. In\ntheir view, abandoning the intent test in favor of an effects test\nwould inevitably require a focus on proportionality —wherever\na minority group won fewer seats in the legislature than its share\nof the population, the charge could be made that the State law had\na discriminatory effect. That, after all, was the type of claim\nbrought in Mobile . But mandating racial proportionality in\nelections was regarded by many as intolerable. Doing so, wrote\nSenator Orrin Hatch in the Washington Star, would be “strongly\nresented by the American public.” Washington Star, Sept. 30, 1980,\np. A–9. The Wall Street Journal offered similar criticism. An\neffects test would generate “more, not less, racial and ethnic\npolarization.” Wall Street Journal, Jan. 19, 1982, p. 28. This sharp debate arrived at Congress’s doorstep\nin 1981. The question whether to broaden §2 or keep it as is, said\nHatch—by then Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee before which §2\nwould be debated—“involve[d] one of the most substantial\nconstitutional issues ever to come before this body.” 2 Hearings\nbefore the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Senate Committee\non the Judiciary, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 1, p. 1\n(1982). Proceedings in Congress mirrored the\ndisagreement that had developed around the country. In April 1981,\nCongressman Peter W. Rodino, Jr.—longtime chairman of the House\nJudiciary Committee—introduced a bill to amend the VRA, proposing\nthat the words “to deny or abridge” in §2 be replaced with the\nphrase “ in a manner which results in a denial or\nabridgement.” H. R. 3112, 97th Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (as\nintroduced) (emphasis added). This was the effects test that Mobile ’s detractors sought. But those wary of proportionality were not far\nbehind. Senator Hatch argued that the effects test “was\nintelligible only to the extent that it approximated a standard of\nproportional representation by race.” Boyd & Markman 1392. The\nAttorney General had the same concern. The effects test “would be\ntriggered whenever election results did not mirror the population\nmix of a particular community,” he wrote, producing “essentially a\nquota system for electoral politics.” N. Y. Times, Mar. 27,\n1982, p. 23. The impasse was not resolved until late April\n1982, when Senator Bob Dole proposed a compromise. Boyd &\nMarkman 1414. Section 2 would include the effects test that many\ndesired but also a robust disclaimer against proportionality.\nSeeking to navigate any tension between the two, the Dole Amendment\nborrowed language from a Fourteenth Amendment case of ours, White v. Regester , 412 U.S.\n755 (1973), which many in Congress believed would allow courts\nto consider effects but avoid proportionality. The standard for\nliability in voting cases, White explained, was whether “the\npolitical processes leading to nomination and election were not\nequally open to participation by the group in question—[in] that\nits members had less opportunity than did other residents in the\ndistrict to participate in the political processes and to elect\nlegislators of their choice.” Id. , at 766. The Dole compromise won bipartisan support and,\non June 18, the Senate passed the 1982 amendments by an\noverwhelming margin, 85–8. Eleven days later, President Reagan\nsigned the Act into law. The amended §2 reads as follows: “(a) No voting qualification or prerequisite\nto voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or\napplied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which\nresults in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of\nthe United States to vote on account of race or color\n. . . as provided in subsection (b). “(b) A violation of subsection (a) is\nestablished if, based on the totality of circumstances, it is shown\nthat the political processes leading to nomination or election in\nthe State or political subdivision are not equally open to\nparticipation by members of a class of citizens . . . in\nthat its members have less opportunity than other members of the\nelectorate to participate in the political process and to elect\nrepresentatives of their choice. The extent to which members of a\nprotected class have been elected to office in the State or\npolitical subdivision is one circumstance which may be considered: Provided , That nothing in this section establishes a right\nto have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to\ntheir proportion in the population.” 52 U. S. C.\n§10301. B For the first 115 years following\nReconstruction, the State of Alabama elected no black\nRepresentatives to Congress. See Singleton v. Merrill , 582 F. Supp. 3d 924, 947 (ND Ala. 2022)\n( per curiam ). In 1992, several plaintiffs sued\nthe State, alleging that it had been impermissibly diluting the\nvotes of black Alabamians in violation of §2. See Wesch v. Hunt , 785 F. Supp. 1491 , 1493 (SD Ala.). The lawsuit produced a\nmajority-black district in Alabama for the first time in decades. Id. , at 1499. And that fall, Birmingham lawyer Earl Hillard\nbecame the first black Representative from Alabama since 1877. 582\nF. Supp. 3d, at 947. Alabama’s congressional map has “remained\nremarkably similar” after Wesch . Brief for Appellants in\nNo. 21–1086 etc., p. 9 (Brief for Alabama). The map\ncontains seven congressional districts, each with a single\nrepresentative. See Supp. App. 205–211; 582 F. Supp. 3d, at\n951. District 1 encompasses the Gulf Coast region in the southwest;\nDistrict 2—known as the Wiregrass region—occupies the southeast;\nDistrict 3 covers the eastern-central part of the State; Districts\n4 and 5 stretch width-wise across the north, with the latter\nlayered atop the former; District 6 is right in the State’s middle;\nand District 7 spans the central west. Id. , at 951. In 2020, the decennial census revealed that\nAlabama’s population had grown by 5.1%. See 1 App. 86. A group of\nplaintiffs led by Alabama legislator Bobby Singleton sued the\nState, arguing that the existing congressional map was\nmalapportioned and racially gerrymandered in violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause. 582 F. Supp. 3d, at 938–939. While\nlitigation was proceeding, the Alabama Legislature’s Committee on\nReapportionment began creating a new districting map. Ibid. Although the prior decade’s population growth did not change the\nnumber of seats that Alabama would receive in the House, the growth\nhad been unevenly distributed across the State, and the existing\nmap was thus out of date. To solve the problem, the State turned to\nexperienced mapmaker Randy Hinaman, who had created several\ndistricting maps that Alabama used over the past 30 years. Id. , at 947–948. The starting point for Hinaman was the\nthen-existing 2011 congressional map, itself a product of the 2001\nmap that Hinaman had also created. Civ. No. 21–1530 (ND Ala.), ECF\nDoc. 70–2, pp. 40, 93–94; see also 582 F. Supp. 3d, at\n950. Hinaman worked to adjust the 2011 map in accordance with the\nredistricting guidelines set by the legislature’s Reapportionment\nCommittee. Id. , at 948–950; 1 App. 275. Those guidelines\nprioritized population equality, contiguity, compactness, and\navoiding dilution of minority voting strength. 582 F. Supp.\n3d, at 1035–1036. They also encouraged, as a secondary matter,\navoiding incumbent pairings, respecting communities of interest,\nminimizing the number of counties in each district, and preserving\ncores of existing districts. Id. , at 1036–1037. The resulting map Hinaman drew largely resembled\nthe 2011 map, again producing only one district in which black\nvoters constituted a majority of the voting age population. Supp.\nApp. 205–211. The Alabama Legislature enacted Hinaman’s map under\nthe name HB1. 582 F. Supp. 3d, at 935, 950–951. Governor Ivey\nsigned HB1 into law on November 4, 2021. Id. , at 950. C Three groups of plaintiffs brought suit\nseeking to stop Alabama’s Secretary of State from conducting\ncongressional elections under HB1. The first group was led by Dr.\nMarcus Caster, a resident of Washington County, who challenged HB1\nas invalid under §2. Id. , at 934–935, 980. The second group,\nled by Montgomery County resident Evan Milligan, brought claims\nunder §2 and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Id. , at 939–940, 966. Finally, the Singleton plaintiffs, who had previously sued to enjoin\nAlabama’s 2011 congressional map, amended their complaint to\nchallenge HB1 as an impermissible racial gerrymander under the\nEqual Protection Clause. Id. , at 938–939. A three-judge District Court was convened,\ncomprised of Circuit Judge Marcus and District Judges Manasco and\nMoorer. The Singleton and Milligan actions were\nconsolidated before the three-judge Court for purposes of\npreliminary injunction proceedings, while Caster proceeded\nbefore Judge Manasco on a parallel track. 582 F. Supp. 3d, at\n934–935. A preliminary injunction hearing began on January 4, 2022,\nand concluded on January 12. Id. , at 943. In that time, the\nthree-judge District Court received live testimony from 17\nwitnesses, reviewed more than 1000 pages of briefing and upwards of\n350 exhibits, and considered arguments from the 43 different\nlawyers who had appeared in the litigation. Id. , at 935–936.\nAfter reviewing that extensive record, the Court concluded in a\n227-page opinion that the question whether HB1 likely violated §2\nwas not “a close one.” It did. Id. , at 1026. The Court thus\npreliminarily enjoined Alabama from using HB1 in forthcoming\nelections. Id. , at 936.[ 3 ] Four days later, on January 28, Alabama moved in\nthis Court for a stay of the District Court’s injunction. This\nCourt granted a stay and scheduled the cases for argument, noting\nprobable jurisdiction in Milligan and granting certiorari\nbefore judgment in Caster . 595 U. S. ___ (2022). II The District Court found that plaintiffs\ndemonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success on their claim that\nHB1 violates §2. We affirm that determination. A For the past forty years, we have evaluated\nclaims brought under §2 using the three-part framework developed in\nour decision Thornburg v. Gingles , 478 U.S.\n30 (1986). Gingles concerned a challenge to North\nCarolina’s multimember districting scheme, which allegedly diluted\nthe vote of its black citizens. Id. , at 34–36. The case\npresented the first opportunity since the 1982 amendments to\naddress how the new §2 would operate. Gingles beg",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus NATIONAL PORK PRODUCERS COUNCIL et al. v . ROSS, SECRETARY OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND\nAGRICULTURE, et al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit No. 21–468. Argued October 11, 2022—Decided\nMay 11, 2023 This case involves a challenge to a California\nlaw known as Proposition 12, which as relevant here forbids the\nin-state sale of whole pork meat that comes from breeding pigs (or\ntheir immediate offspring) that are “confined in a cruel manner.”\nCal. Health & Safety Code Ann. §25990(b)(2). Confinement is\n“cruel” if it prevents a pig from “lying down, standing up, fully\nextending [its] limbs, or turning around freely.”\n§25991(e)(1) . Prior to the vote on Proposition 12,\nproponents suggested the law would benefit animal welfare and\nconsumer health, and opponents claimed that existing farming\npractices did better than Proposition 12 protecting animal welfare\n(for example, by preventing pig-on-pig aggression) and ensuring\nconsumer health (by avoiding contamination). Shortly after\nProposition 12’s adoption, two organizations—the National Pork\nProducers Council and the American Farm Bureau Federation\n(petitioners)—filed this lawsuit on behalf of their members who\nraise and process pigs alleging that Proposition 12 violates the\nU. S. Constitution by impermissibly burdening interstate\ncommerce. Petitioners estimated that the cost of compliance with\nProposition 12 will increase production costs and will fall on both\nCalifornia and out-of-state producers. But because California\nimports almost all the pork it consumes, most of Proposition 12’s\ncompliance costs will be borne by out-of-state firms. The district\ncourt held that petitioners’ complaint failed to state a claim as a\nmatter of law and dismissed the case. The Ninth Circuit\naffirmed. Held : The judgment of the Ninth\nCircuit is affirmed. 6 4th 1021, affirmed. Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the\nCourt, except as to Parts IV–B, IV–C, and IV–D, rejecting\npetitioners’ theories that would place Proposition 12 in violation\nof the dormant Commerce Clause even though petitioners do not\nallege the law purposefully discriminates against out-of-state\neconomic interests. Pp 5–17, 27–29. (a) The Constitution vests Congress with\nthe power to “regulate Commerce . . . among the\nseveral States.” Art. I, §8, cl. 3. Although Congress may seek\nto exercise this power to regulate the interstate trade of pork,\nand many pork producers have urged Congress to do so, Congress has\nyet to adopt any statute that might displace Proposition 12 or laws\nregulating pork production in other States. Petitioners’ litigation\ntheory thus rests on the dormant Commerce Clause theory,\npursuant to which the Commerce Clause not only vests Congress with\nthe power to regulate interstate trade, but also “contain[s] a\nfurther, negative command,” one effectively forbidding the\nenforcement of “certain state [economic regulations] even when\nCongress has failed to legislate on the subject.” Oklahoma Tax\nComm’n v. Jefferson Lines , Inc. , 514 U.S.\n175 , 179. This Court has held that state laws offend this\ndormant aspect of the Commerce Clause when they seek to “build\nup . . . domestic commerce” through “burdens upon\nthe industry and business of other States.” Guy v. Baltimore , 100 U.S.\n434 , 443. At the same time, though, the Court has reiterated\nthat, absent purposeful discrimination, “a State may exclude from\nits territory, or prohibit the sale therein of any articles which,\nin its judgment, fairly exercised, are prejudicial to” the\ninterests of its citizens. Ibid. The antidiscrimination principle lies at the\n“very core” of the Court’s dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Camps Newfound/Owatonna , Inc. v. Town of\nHarrison , 520 U.S.\n564 , 581. This Court has said that the Commerce Clause\nprohibits the enforcement of state laws “driven by . . .\n‘economic protectionism — that is, regulatory measures\ndesigned to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening\nout-of-state competitors.’ ” Department of Revenue of\nKy. v. Davis , 553 U.S.\n328 , 337–338 (quoting New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach , 486 U.S.\n269 , 273–274). Petitioners here disavow any\ndiscrimination-based claim, conceding that Proposition 12 imposes\nthe same burdens on in-state pork producers that it imposes on\nout-of-state pork producers. Pp 5–8. (b) Given petitioners’ concession that\nProposition 12 does not implicate the antidiscrimination principle,\npetitioners first invoke what they call the “extraterritoriality\ndoctrine.” They contend that the Court’s dormant Commerce Clause\ncases suggest an additional and “almost per se ” rule\nforbidding enforcement of state laws that have the “practical\neffect of controlling commerce outside the State,” even when those\nlaws do not purposely discriminate against out-of-state interests.\nPetitioners further insist that Proposition 12 offends this “almost per se ” rule because the law will impose substantial\nnew costs on out-of-state pork producers who wish to sell their\nproducts in California. Petitioners contend the rule they propose\nfollows ineluctably from three cases: Healy v. Beer\nInstitute , 491 U.S.\n324 ; Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State\nLiquor Authority , 476 U.S.\n573 ; and Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig , Inc. , 294 U.S.\n511 . But a close look at those cases reveals that each typifies\nthe familiar concern with preventing purposeful discrimination\nagainst out-of-state economic interests. In Baldwin , a New\nYork law that barred out-of-state dairy farmers from selling their\nmilk in the State for less than the minimum price New York law\nguaranteed in-state producers “plainly discriminate[d]” against\nout-of-staters by “erecting an economic barrier protecting a major\nlocal industry against competition from without the State.” Dean\nMilk Co. v. Madison , 340 U.S.\n349 , 354 (discussing Baldwin ). In Brown-Forman , a\nNew York law that required liquor distillers to affirm that their\nin-state prices were no higher than their out-of-state prices\nimpermissibly sought to force out-of-state distillers to\n“surrender” whatever cost advantages they enjoyed against their\nin-state rivals, which amounted to economic protectionism. 476\nU. S., at 580. The Court reached a similar conclusion in Healy , which involved a Connecticut law that required\nout-of-state beer merchants to affirm that their in-state prices\nwere no higher than those they charged in neighboring States. 491\nU. S., at 328–330. As the Court later explained, “[t]he\nessential vice in laws” like Connecticut’s is that they “hoard”\ncommerce “for the benefit of ” in-state merchants and\ndiscourage consumers from crossing state lines to make their\npurchases from nearby out-of-state vendors. C & A\nCarbone , Inc. v. Clarkstown , 511 U.S.\n383 , 391–392. Petitioners insist that Baldwin , Brown-Forman , and Healy taken together suggest an\n“almost per se ” rule against state laws with\n“extraterritorial effects.” While petitioners point to language in\nthese cases pertaining to the “practical effect” of the challenged\nlaws on out-of-state commerce and prices, “the language of an\nopinion is not always to be parsed as though we were dealing with\nlanguage of a statute.” Reiter v. Sonotone Corp. , 442 U.S.\n330 , 341. The language highlighted by petitioners in Baldwin , Brown-Forman , and Healy appeared in a\nparticular context and did particular work. A close look at those\ncases reveals nothing like the “almost per se ” rule against\nlaws that have the “practical effect” of “controlling”\nextraterritorial commerce that petitioners posit, and indeed\npetitioners’ reading would cast a shadow over laws long understood\nto represent valid exercises of the States’ constitutionally\nreserved powers. Baldwin , Brown-Forman , and Healy did not mean to do so much. In rejecting petitioners’\n“almost per se ” theory the Court does not mean to trivialize\nthe role territory and sovereign boundaries play in the federal\nsystem; the Constitution takes great care to provide rules for\nfixing and changing state borders. Art. IV, §3, cl. 1. Courts\nmust sometimes referee disputes about where one State’s authority\nends and another’s begins—both inside and outside the commercial\ncontext. Indeed, the antidiscrimination principle found in the\nCourt’s dormant Commerce Clause cases may well represent one more\neffort to mediate competing claims of sovereign authority under our\nhorizontal separation of powers. But none of this means, as\npetitioners suppose, that any question about the ability of\na State to project its power extraterritorially must yield to an\n“almost per se ” rule under the dormant Commerce Clause. This\nCourt has never before claimed so much “ground for judicial\nsupremacy under the banner of the dormant Commerce Clause.” United Haulers Assn. , Inc. v. Oneida-Herkimer\nSolid Waste Management Authority , 550 U.S.\n330 , 346–347. Pp 8–14. (c) Petitioners next point to Pike v. Bruce Church , Inc ., 397 U.S.\n137 , which they assert requires a court to at least assess\n“ ‘the burden imposed on interstate commerce’ ” by a\nstate law and prevent its enforcement if the law’s burdens are\n“ ‘clearly excessive in relation to the putative local\nbenefits.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 44. Petitioners provide a\nlitany of reasons why they believe the benefits Proposition 12\nsecures for Californians do not outweigh the costs it imposes on\nout-of-state economic interests. Petitioners overstate the extent to which Pike and its progeny depart from the antidiscrimination rule\nthat lies at the core of the Court’s dormant Commerce Clause\njurisprudence. As this Court has previously explained, “no clear\nline” separates the Pike line of cases from core\nantidiscrimination precedents. General Motors Corp. v. Tracy , 519 U.S.\n278 , 298, n. 12. If some cases focus on whether a state\nlaw discriminates on its face, the Pike line serves as an\nimportant reminder that a law’s practical effects may also disclose\nthe presence of a discriminatory purpose. Pike itself\nconcerned an Arizona order requiring cantaloupes grown in state to\nbe processed and packed in state. 397 U. S., at 138–140. The\nCourt held that Arizona’s order violated the dormant Commerce\nClause, stressing that even if that order could be fairly\ncharacterized as facially neutral, it “requir[ed] business\noperations to be performed in [state] that could more efficiently\nbe performed elsewhere.” Id. , at 145. The “practical\neffect[s]” of the order in operation thus revealed a discriminatory\npurpose—an effort to insulate in-state processing and packaging\nbusinesses from out-of-state competition. Id. , at 140. While\nthis Court has left the “courtroom door open” to challenges\npremised on “even nondiscriminatory burdens,” Davis , 553 U.\nS., at 353, and while “a small number of our cases have invalidated\nstate laws . . . that appear to have been genuinely\nnondiscriminatory,” Tracy , 519 U. S., at 298, n. 12,\npetitioners’ claim about Proposition 12 falls well outside Pike ’s heartland. Pp 15–18. (d) The Framers equipped Congress with\nconsiderable power to regulate interstate commerce and preempt\ncontrary state laws. See U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 3;\nArt. IV, §2. While this Court has inferred an additional\njudicially enforceable rule against certain state laws adopted even\nagainst the backdrop of congressional silence, the Court’s cases\nalso suggest extreme caution is warranted in its exercise.\nDisavowing reliance on this Court’s core dormant Commerce Clause\nteachings focused on discriminatory state legislation, petitioners\ninvite the Court to endorse new theories of implied judicial power.\nThey would have the Court recognize an “almost per se ” rule against the enforcement of state laws that have\n“extraterritorial effects”—even though it has long recognized that\nvirtually all state laws create ripple effects beyond their\nborders. Alternatively, they would have the Court prevent a State\nfrom regulating the sale of an ordinary consumer good within its\nown borders on nondiscriminatory terms—even though the Pike line of cases they invoke has never before yielded such a result.\nLike the courts that faced this case below, this Court declines\nboth incautious invitations. Pp 27–29. Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Thomas and\nJustice Barrett, concluded in Part IV–B that, accepting\npetitioners’ allegations, the Pike balancing task that they\npropose in this case is one no court is equipped to undertake. Some\nout-of-state producers who choose to comply with Proposition 12 may\nincur new costs, while the law serves moral and health interests of\nsome magnitude for in-state residents. In a functioning democracy,\nthose sorts of policy choices—balancing competing, incommensurable\ngoods—belong to the people and their elected representatives. Pp\n18–21. Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Thomas,\nJustice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan, concluded in Part IV–C that\nthe allegations in the complaint were insufficient as a matter of\nlaw to demonstrate a substantial burden on interstate commerce, a\nshowing Pike requires before a court may assess the\nlaw’s competing benefits or weigh the two sides against each other,\nand that the facts pleaded merely allege harm to some producers’\nfavored “methods of operation” which the Court found insufficient\nto state a claim in Exxon Corp. v. Governor of\nMaryland , 437 U.S.\n117 , 127. Pp 21–25. Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Thomas and\nJustice Barrett, concluded in Part IV–D that petitioners have not\nasked the Court to treat putative harms to out-of-state animal\nwelfare or other noneconomic interests as freestanding harms\ncognizable under the dormant Commerce Clause, and in any event that\nthe Court’s decisions authorizing claims alleging “burdens on\ncommerce,” Davis , 553 U. S., at 353, do not provide\njudges “a roving license” to reassess the wisdom of state\nlegislation in light of any conceivable out-of-state interest,\neconomic or otherwise. United Haulers , 550 U. S., at\n343. Pp 25–27. Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justice Kagan,\nconcluded that the judgment should be affirmed, not because courts\nare incapable of balancing economic burdens against noneconomic\nbenefits as Pike requires or because of any other\nfundamental reworking of that doctrine, but because petitioners\nfail to plausibly allege a substantial burden on interstate\ncommerce as required by Pike . Pp 1–3. Justice Barrett concluded that the judgment\nshould be affirmed because Pike balancing requires both the\nbenefits and burdens of a State law to be judicially cognizable and\ncomparable, see Department of Revenue of Ky. v. Davis , 553 U.S.\n328 , 354–355, but the benefits and burdens of Proposition 12\nare incommensurable; that said, the complaint plausibly alleges a\nsubstantial burden on interstate commerce because Proposition 12’s\ncosts are pervasive, burdensome, and will be felt primarily (but\nnot exclusively) outside California. Pp 1–2.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 21–468 _________________ NATIONAL PORK PRODUCERS COUNCIL, et al.,\nPETITIONERS v. KAREN ROSS, in her official capacity as\nSECRETARY OF THE CALI- FORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD & AGRICULTURE,\net al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit [May 11, 2023] Justice Gorsuch announced the judgment of the\nCourt and delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Parts\nIV–B, IV–C, and IV–D. What goods belong in our stores? Usually,\nconsumer demand and local laws supply some of the answer. Recently,\nCalifornia adopted just such a law banning the in-state sale of\ncertain pork products derived from breeding pigs confined in stalls\nso small they cannot lie down, stand up, or turn around. In\nresponse, two groups of out-of-state pork producers filed this\nlawsuit, arguing that the law unconstitutionally interferes with\ntheir preferred way of doing business in violation of this Court’s\ndormant Commerce Clause precedents. Both the district court and\ncourt of appeals dismissed the producers’ complaint for failing to\nstate a claim. We affirm. Companies that choose to sell\nproducts in various States must normally comply with the laws of\nthose various States. Assuredly, under this Court’s dormant\nCommerce Clause decisions, no State may use its laws to\ndiscriminate purposefully against out-of-state economic interests.\nBut the pork producers do not suggest that California’s law offends\nthis principle. Instead, they invite us to fashion two new and more\naggressive constitutional restrictions on the ability of States to\nregulate goods sold within their borders. We decline that\ninvitation. While the Constitution addresses many weighty issues,\nthe type of pork chops California merchants may sell is not on that\nlist. I Modern American grocery stores offer a\ndizzying array of choice. Often, consumers may choose among eggs\nthat are large, medium, or small; eggs that are white, brown, or\nsome other color; eggs from cage-free chickens or ones raised\nconsistent with organic farming standards. When it comes to meat\nand fish, the options are no less plentiful. Products may be\nmarketed as free range, wild caught, or graded by quality (prime,\nchoice, select, and beyond). The pork products at issue here, too,\nsometimes come with “antibiotic-free” and “crate-free” labels.\nUSDA, Report to Congress: Livestock Mandatory Reporting 18 (2018),\nhttps://www.ams.usda.gov/sites/default/files/\nmedia/LMR2018ReporttoCongress.pdf. Much of this product\ndifferentiation reflects consumer demand, informed by individual\ntaste, health, or moral considerations. Informed by similar concerns, States (and their\npredecessors) have long enacted laws aimed at protecting animal\nwelfare. As far back as 1641, the Massachusetts Bay Colony\nprohibited “Tirranny or Crueltie towards any bruite Creature.” Body\nof Liberties §92, in A Bibliographical Sketch of the Laws of the\nMassachusetts Colony 52–53 (1890). Today, Massachusetts prohibits\nthe sale of pork products from breeding pigs (or their offspring)\nif the breeding pig has been confined “in a manner that prevents\n[it] from lying down, standing up, fully extending [its] limbs or\nturning around freely.” Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 129, App. §§1–3,\n1–5 (Cum. Supp. 2023). Nor is that State alone. Florida’s\nConstitution prohibits “any person [from] confin[ing] a pig during\npregnancy . . . in such a way that she is prevented\nfrom turning around freely.” Art. X, §21(a). Arizona, Maine,\nMichigan, Oregon, and Rhode Island, too, have laws regulating\nanimal confinement practices within their borders. See Ariz. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §13–2910.07(A) (2018); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 7,\n§§4020(1)–(2) (2018); Mich. Comp. Laws §287.746(2) (West Cum. Supp.\n2022); Ore. Rev. Stat. §§600.150(1)–(2) (2021); R. I. Gen.\nLaws §4–1.1–3 (Supp. 2022). This case involves a challenge to a California\nlaw known as Proposition 12. In November 2018 and with the support\nof about 63% of participating voters, California adopted a ballot\ninitiative that revised the State’s existing standards for the\nin-state sale of eggs and announced new standards for the in-state\nsale of pork and veal products. App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a–46a. As\nrelevant here, Proposition 12 forbids the in-state sale of whole\npork meat that comes from breeding pigs (or their immediate\noffspring) that are “confined in a cruel manner.” Cal. Health &\nSafety Code Ann. §25990(b)(2) (West Cum. Supp. 2023). Subject to\ncertain exceptions, the law deems confinement “cruel” if it\nprevents a pig from “lying down, standing up, fully extending [its]\nlimbs, or turning around freely.” §25991(e)(1) . Since\nProposition 12’s adoption, the State has begun developing “proposed\nregulations” that would permit compliance “certification[s]” to be\nissued “by non-governmental third parties, many used for myriad\nprograms ( e.g. , ‘organic’) already.” Brief for Intervenor\nRespondents 30, n. 8. A spirited debate preceded the vote on\nProposition 12. Proponents observed that, in some farming\noperations, pregnant pigs remain “[e]ncased” for 16 weeks in\n“fit-to-size” metal crates. M. Scully, A Brief for the Pigs: The\nCase of National Pork Producers Council v. Ross ,\nNational Review, July 11, 2022,\nhttps://www.nationalreview.com/2022/\n07/a-brief-for-the-pigs-the-case-of-national-pork-producers-council-v-ross/.\nThese animals may receive their only opportunity for exercise when\nthey are moved to a separate barn to give birth and later returned\nfor another 16 weeks of pregnancy confinement—with the cycle\nrepeating until the pigs are slaughtered. Ibid. Proponents\nhoped that Proposition 12 would go a long way toward eliminating\npork sourced in this manner “from the California marketplace.” A.\nPadilla, Cal. Secretary of State, California General\nElection—Official Voter Information Guide 70 (Nov. 6, 2018) (Voter\nGuide), https://vig.cdn.sos.ca.gov/2018/general/pdf/\ncomplete-vig.pdf. Proponents also suggested that the law would have\nhealth benefits for consumers because “packing animals in tiny,\nfilthy cages increases the risk of food poisoning.” Ibid. ;\nsee App. to Pet. for Cert. 201a–202a. Opponents pressed their case in strong terms\ntoo. They argued that existing farming practices did a better job\nof protecting animal welfare (for example, by preventing pig-on-pig\naggression) and ensuring consumer health (by avoiding\ncontamination) than Proposition 12 would. Id ., at 185a–187a;\nsee also Voter Guide 70–71. They also warned voters that\nProposition 12 would require some farmers and processors to incur\nnew costs. Id ., at 69. Ones that might be “passed through”\nto California consumers. Ibid. Shortly after Proposition 12’s adoption, two\norganizations—the National Pork Producers Council and the American\nFarm Bureau Federation (collectively, petitioners)—filed this\nlawsuit on behalf of their members who raise and process pigs. App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 154a–155a. Petitioners alleged that Proposition\n12 violates the U. S. Constitution by impermissibly burdening\ninterstate commerce. Id. , at 230a–232a. In support of that legal claim, petitioners\npleaded a number of facts. They acknowledged that, in response to\nconsumer demand and the laws of other States, 28% of their industry\nhas already converted to some form of group housing for pregnant\npigs. Id. , at 186a. But, petitioners cautioned, even some\nfarmers who already raise group-housed pigs will have to modify\ntheir practices if they wish to comply with Proposition 12. Id. , at 208a–209a. Much of pork production today is\nvertically integrated, too, with farmers selling pigs to large\nprocessing firms that turn them into different “cuts of meat” and\ndistribute the “different parts  . . . all over to\ncompletely different end users.” Id. , at 334a–335a. Revising\nthis system to segregate and trace Proposition 12-compliant pork,\npetitioners alleged, will require certain processing firms to make\nsubstantial new capital investments. Id. , at 205a–206a.\nUltimately, petitioners estimated that “compliance with Proposition\n12 will increase production costs” by “9.2% . . . at\nthe farm level.” Id. , at 214a. These compliance costs will\nfall on California and out-of-state producers alike. Ibid .\nBut because California imports almost all the pork it consumes,\npetitioners emphasized, “the majority” of Proposition 12’s\ncompliance costs will be initially borne by out-of-state firms. Ibid . After considerable motions practice, the\ndistrict court held that petitioners’ complaint failed to state a\nclaim as a matter of law and dismissed the case. 456 F. Supp.\n3d 1201 (SD Cal. 2020). With Judge Ikuta writing for a unanimous\npanel, the Ninth Circuit affirmed. 6 F. 4th 1021 (2021).\nFollowing that ruling, petitioners sought certiorari and we agreed\nto consider the complaint’s legal sufficiency for ourselves. 596\nU. S. ___ (2022). II The Constitution vests Congress with the power\nto “regulate Commerce . . . among the several\nStates.” Art. I, §8, cl. 3. Everyone agrees that Congress may\nseek to exercise this power to regulate the interstate trade of\npork, much as it has done with various other products. Everyone\nagrees, too, that congressional enactments may preempt conflicting\nstate laws. See Art. VI, cl. 2. But everyone also agrees that\nwe have nothing like that here. Despite the persistent efforts of\ncertain pork producers, Congress has yet to adopt any statute that\nmight displace Proposition 12 or laws regulating pork production in\nother States. See, e.g. , H. R. 272, 116th Cong., 1st\nSess., §2 (2019); H. R. 4879, 115th Cong., 2d Sess., §2(a)\n(2018); H. R. 3599, 115th Cong., 1st Sess., §2(a) (2017);\nH. R. 687, 114th Cong., 1st Sess., §2(a) (2015). That has led petitioners to resort to\nlitigation, pinning their hopes on what has come to be called the dormant Commerce Clause. Reading between the Constitution’s\nlines, petitioners observe, this Court has held that the Commerce\nClause not only vests Congress with the power to regulate\ninterstate trade; the Clause also “contain[s] a further, negative\ncommand,” one effectively forbidding the enforcement of “certain\nstate [economic regulations] even when Congress has failed to\nlegislate on the subject.” Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v. Jefferson Lines , Inc. , 514 U.S.\n175 , 179 (1995). This view of the Commerce Clause developed\ngradually. In Gibbons v. Ogden , Chief Justice\nMarshall recognized that the States’ constitutionally reserved\npowers enable them to regulate commerce in their own jurisdictions\nin ways sure to have “a remote and considerable influence on\ncommerce” in other States. 9 Wheat. 1, 203 (1824). By way of\nexample, he cited “[i]nspection laws, quarantine laws, [and] health\nlaws of every description.” Ibid. At the same time, however,\nChief Justice Marshall saw “great force in th[e] argument” that the\nCommerce Clause might impliedly bar certain types of state economic\nregulation. Id. , at 209. Decades later, in Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for\nRelief of Distressed Pilots , this Court again recognized that\nthe power vested in Congress to regulate interstate commerce leaves\nthe States substantial leeway to adopt their own commercial codes.\n12 How. 299, 317–321 (1852). But once more, the Court hinted that\nthe Constitution may come with some restrictions on what “may be\nregulated by the States” even “in the absence of all congressional\nlegislation.” Id. , at 320. Eventually, the Court cashed out these warnings,\nholding that state laws offend the Commerce Clause when they seek\nto “build up . . . domestic commerce” through\n“burdens upon the industry and business of other States,”\nregardless of whether Congress has spoken. Guy v. Baltimore , 100 U.S.\n434 , 443 (1880). At the same time, though, the Court reiterated\nthat, absent discrimination, “a State may exclude from its\nterritory, or prohibit the sale therein of any articles which, in\nits judgment, fairly exercised, are prejudicial to” the interests\nof its citizens. Ibid. Today, this antidiscrimination principle lies at\nthe “very core” of our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Camps Newfound/Owatonna , Inc. v. Town of\nHarrison , 520 U.S.\n564 , 581 (1997). In its “modern” cases, this Court has said\nthat the Commerce Clause prohibits the enforcement of state laws\n“driven by . . . ‘economic protectionism — that is,\nregulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests\nby burdening out-of-state competitors.’ ” Department of\nRevenue of Ky. v. Davis , 553 U.S.\n328 , 337–338 (2008) (quoting New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach , 486 U.S.\n269 , 273–274 (1988)); see also Tennessee Wine and Spirits\nRetailers Assn. v. Thomas , 588 U. S. ___, ___\n(2019) (slip op., at 9) (observing that this Court’s cases operate\nprincipally to “safeguard against state protectionism”); Northwest Airlines , Inc. v. County of Kent , 510 U.S.\n355 , 373, n. 18 (1994) (describing “a violation of the\ndormant Commerce Clause” as “discrimination against interstate\ncommerce”). Admittedly, some “Members of the Court have\nauthored vigorous and thoughtful critiques of this interpretation”\nof the Commerce Clause. Tennessee Wine , 588 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 7) (citing cases). They have not necessarily\nquarreled with the antidiscrimination principle. But they have\nsuggested that it may be more appropriately housed elsewhere in the\nConstitution. Perhaps in the Import–Export Clause, which prohibits\nStates from “lay[ing] any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports”\nwithout permission from Congress. Art. I, §10, cl. 2; see Camps Newfound/Owatonna , 520 U. S., at 621–637 (Thomas,\nJ., dissenting). Perhaps in the Privileges and Immunities Clause,\nwhich entitles “[t]he Citizens of each State” to “all Privileges\nand Immunities of Citizens in the several States.” Art. IV,\n§2; see Tyler Pipe Industries , Inc. v. Washington\nState Dept. of Revenue , 483 U.S.\n232 , 265 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting\nin part). Or perhaps the principle inheres in the very structure of\nthe Constitution, which “was framed upon the theory that the\npeoples of the several [S]tates must sink or swim together.” American Trucking Assns. , Inc. v. Michigan Pub.\nServ. Comm’n , 545 U.S.\n429 , 433 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Whatever one thinks about these critiques, we\nhave no need to engage with any of them to resolve this case. Even\nunder our received dormant Commerce Clause case law, petitioners\nbegin in a tough spot. They do not allege that California’s law\nseeks to advantage in-state firms or disadvantage out-of-state\nrivals. In fact, petitioners disavow any\ndiscrimination-based claim, conceding that Proposition 12 imposes\nthe same burdens on in-state pork producers that it imposes on\nout-of-state ones. As petitioners put it, “the dormant Commerce\nClause . . . bar on protectionist state statutes\nthat discriminate against interstate commerce . . .\nis not in issue here.” Brief for Petitioners 2, n. 2. III Having conceded that California’s law does not\nimplicate the antidiscrimination principle at the core of this\nCourt’s dormant Commerce Clause cases, petitioners are left to\npursue two more ambitious theories. In the first, petitioners\ninvoke what they call “extraterritoriality doctrine.” Id .,\nat 19. They contend that our dormant Commerce Clause cases suggest\nan additional and “almost per se ” rule forbidding\nenforcement of state laws that have the “practical effect of\ncontrolling commerce outside the State,” even when those laws do\nnot purposely discriminate against out-of-state economic interests. Ibid. Petitioners further insist that Proposition 12 offends\nthis “almost per se ” rule because the law will impose\nsubstantial new costs on out-of-state pork producers who wish to\nsell their products in California. A This argument falters out of the gate. Put\naside what problems may attend the minor (factual) premise of this\nargument. Focus just on the major (legal) premise. Petitioners say\nthe “almost per se ” rule they propose follows\nineluctably from three cases— Healy v. Beer Institute , 491 U.S.\n324 (1989); Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York\nState Liquor Authority , 476 U.S.\n573 (1986); and Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig , Inc. , 294 U.S.\n511 (1935). A close look at those cases, however, reveals\nnothing like the rule petitioners posit. Instead, each typifies the\nfamiliar concern with preventing purposeful discrimination against\nout-of-state economic interests. Start with Baldwin . There, this Court\nrefused to enforce New York laws that barred out-of-state dairy\nfarmers from selling their milk in the State “unless the price paid\nto” them matched the minimum price New York law guaranteed in-state\nproducers. Id ., at 519. In that way, the challenged laws\ndeliberately robbed out-of-state dairy farmers of the opportunity\nto charge lower prices in ",

SOUTH CAROLINA STATE CONFERENCE OF THE\nNAACP et al. appeal from the united states district court\nfor the district of south carolina No. 22-807. Argued October 11, 2023—Decided\nMay 23, 2024 The Constitution entrusts state legislatures\nwith the primary responsibility for drawing congressional\ndistricts, and legislative redistricting is an inescapably\npolitical enterprise. Claims that a map is unconstitutional because\nit was drawn to achieve a partisan end are not justiciable in\nfederal court. By contrast, if a legislature gives race a\npredominant role in redistricting decisions, the resulting map is\nsubjected to strict scrutiny and may be held unconstitutional.\nThese doctrinal lines collide when race and partisan preference are\nhighly correlated. This Court has endorsed two related propositions\nwhen navigating this tension. First, a party challenging a map's\nconstitutionality must disentangle race and politics to show that\nrace was the legislature's “predominant” motivating factor. Miller v. Johnson , 515 U.S.\n900 , 916. Second, the Court starts with a presumption that the\nlegislature acted in good faith. To disentangle race from other\npermissible considerations, plaintiffs may employ some combination\nof direct and circumstantial evidence. Cooper v. Harris , 581 U.S. 285, 291. Where race and politics are\nhighly correlated, a map that has been gerrymandered to achieve a\npartisan end can look very similar to a racially gerrymandered map.\nThus, in Easley v. Cromartie , 532\nU.S. 234 , the Court held that the plaintiffs failed to meet the\nhigh bar for a racial-gerrymandering claim when they failed to\nproduce an alternative map showing that a rational legislature\nsincerely driven by its professed partisan goals would have drawn a\ndifferent map with greater racial balance. Id., at 258.\nWithout an alternative map, the Court also found it difficult for\nplaintiffs to defeat the starting presumption that the legislature\nacted in good faith. Following the 2020 Census, South Carolina was\ntasked with redrawing its congressional district maps because of\npopulation shifts in two of its seven districts—Districts 1 and 6.\nThe State Senate subcommittee responsible for drawing the new map\nissued a statement explaining that the process would be guided by\ntraditional districting principles along with the goal of creating\na stronger Republican tilt in District 1. To draw the new maps, the\nSenate turned to Will Roberts, a nonpartisan staffer with\nexperience in drawing reapportionment plans. Roberts' plan (the\nEnacted Plan) achieved the legislature's political goal by\nincreasing District 1's projected Republican vote share by 1.36% to\n54.39%. The plan also raised the black voting-age population (BVAP)\nfrom 16.56% to 16.72%. The legislature adopted the plan, and the\nGovernor signed it into law. The National Association for the Advancement\nof Colored People and District 1 voter Taiwan Scott (Challengers),\nchallenged the plan, alleging that it resulted in racial\ngerrymanders in certain districts and in the dilution of the\nelectoral power of the State's black voters. The three-judge\nDistrict Court held that the State drew District 1 with a 17% BVAP\ntarget in mind in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and that\nthis putative use of race to draw District 1 unlawfully diluted the\nblack vote. Held : 1. The District Court's finding that race\npredominated in the design of District I in the Enacted Plan was\nclearly erroneous. Pp. 12-35. (a) Because the State's principal legal\nargument—that the District Court did not properly disentangle race\nfrom politics—is an attack on the factual basis of the District\nCourt's findings, this case can be disposed on clear-error grounds.\nThe District Court clearly erred because the Challengers did not\nsatisfy the demanding burden of showing that the “legislature\nsubordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles . . .\nto racial considerations.” Miller , 515 U. S., at 916. The\nChallengers provided no direct evidence of a racial gerrymander,\nand their circumstantial evidence is very weak. Instead the\nChallengers relied on deeply flawed expert reports. And the\nChallengers did not offer a single alternative map to show that the\nlegislature's partisan goal could be achieved while raising the\nBVAP in District 1. Pp. 12-13. (b) The District Court's factual findings in\nthis case are reviewed for clear error. Because the racial\npredominance test has a very substantial legal component that must\ntake account of the Court's prior relevant decisions, special care\nmust be exercised in reviewing the relevant findings of fact. Pp.\n13-14. (c) The District Court's heavy reliance on\nfour pieces of evidence was seriously misguided in light of the\nappropriate legal standard and repeated instructions that a court\nin a case such as this must rule out the possibility that politics\ndrove the districting process. None of the facts on which the\nDistrict Court relied to infer a racial motive is sufficient to\nsupport an inference that can overcome the presumption of\nlegislative good faith. First, the District Court concluded that\nthe legislature deliberately sought to maintain a particular BVAP\nbecause the maps that produced the sought-after partisan goal all\nhad roughly the same BVAP. But the mere fact that District 1's BVAP\nremained around 17%, despite all the changes made during the\nredistricting process, proves very little. The tight correlation\nbetween the legislature's partisan aim and District 1's BVAP is\nsubstantiated by the District Court's own findings. The Challengers\ncould not point to a single map in the record that would satisfy\nthe legislature's political aim with a BVAP above 17%. The District\nCourt disregarded the presumption of legislative good faith by\ndrawing an inference that the State acted in bad faith based on the\nracial consequences of a political gerrymander in a jurisdiction in\nwhich race and partisan preference are very closely related.\nSecond, the District Court inferred a racial motive from the fact\nthat the Enacted Plan moved more voters out of District 1 than were\nneeded to comply with the one person, one vote rule, and that the\nEnacted Plan split a few counties. But the high priority that the\nlegislature gave to its partisan aim can explain these decisions.\nThird, the District Court clearly erred when it concluded that the\nlegislature's real aim was racial based on the movement of certain\npredominantly black Charleston precincts from District 1 to\nDistrict 6. Again, the legislature's partisan goal can easily\nexplain this decision. Fourth, the District Court placed excessive\nweight on the fact that several legislative staffers admitted to\nviewing racial data at some point during the redistricting process.\nThe District Court cited no evidence that could not also support\nthe inference that politics drove the mapmaking process and\nprovided no explanation why a mapmaker who wanted to produce a\nversion of District 1 that would be safely Republican would use\ndata about voters' race rather than their political preferences.\nPp. 14-19. (d) The four expert reports relied upon by the\nChallengers are flawed because they ignored traditional districting\ncriteria such as geographical constraints and the legislature's\npartisan interests. Allen v. Milligan , 599 U.S. 1,\n34. The report of Dr. Kosuke Imai made no effort to disentangle\nrace from politics. It also failed to consider “core district\nretention,” a term referring to “the proportion of districts that\nremain when a State transitions from one districting plan to\nanother.” Id. , at 21. The report of Dr. Jordan Ragusa did\nattempt to disentangle race from politics, but its analysis has two\nserious defects. First, each of his three models failed to control\nfor contiguity or compactness. Second, he used an inferior method\nof measuring a precinct's partisan leanings by counting absolute\nvotes rather than a party's relative share of the vote. The report\nof Dr. Baodong Liu purported to show that race rather than politics\nexplains District 1's design, but Dr. Liu's methodology was plainly\nflawed. Like Dr. Ragusa, Dr. Liu failed to account for contiguity\nand compactness. And while this defect alone is sufficient to\npreclude reliance, Dr. Liu also used inferior data to measure a\ndistrict's partisan tilt— i.e., data from the 2018 off-cycle\ngubernatorial primaries. Finally, the report of Dr. Moon Duchin,\nlike that of Dr. Imai, did not account for partisanship or core\nretention and was based on an assessment of the map as a whole\nrather than District 1 in particular. Thus, her report has no\nprobative force with respect to the Challengers'\nracial-gerrymandering claim regarding District 1's boundaries. Pp.\n19-29. (e) The District Court also critically erred\nby failing to draw an adverse inference against the Challengers for\nnot providing an adequate alternate map. By showing that a rational\nlegislature, driven only by its professed mapmaking criteria, could\nhave produced a different map with “greater racial balance,” Cromartie , 532 U. S., at 258, an alternative map can perform\nthe critical task of distinguishing between racial and political\nmotivations when race and partisanship are closely entwined.\nMoreover, an alternative map is easy to produce. The District Court\nmistakenly held that an alternative map is relevant only for the\npurpose of showing that a remedy is plausible. A plaintiff's\nfailure to submit an alternative map should be interpreted by\ncourts as an implicit concession that the plaintiff cannot draw a\nmap that undermines the legislature's defense. Pp. 30-31. 2. Because the same findings of fact and\nreasoning that guided the court's racial-gerrymandering analysis\nalso guided the analysis of the Challengers' independent\nvote-dilution claim, that conclusion also cannot stand. The\nDistrict Court also erred in conflating the two claims. A plaintiff\npressing a vote-dilution claim cannot prevail simply by showing\nthat race played a predominant role in the districting process, but\nrather must show that the State “enacted a particular voting scheme\nas a purposeful device to minimize or cancel out the voting\npotential of racial or ethnic minorities.” Miller , 515 U.\nS., at 911. In other words, the plaintiff must show that the\nState's districting plan “has the purpose and effect” of diluting\nthe minority vote. Shaw v. Reno , 509 U.S.\n630 , 649. In light of these two errors in the District Court's\nanalysis, a remand is appropriate. Pp. 34-35. Reversed in part and remanded in part.

ALEXANDER, in his official capacity\nas PRESIDENT OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA SENATE, et al., APPELLANTS v. THE SOUTH CAROLINA STATE CONFERENCE OF THE NAACP, et\nal. on appeal from the united states district\ncourt for the district of south carolina [May 23, 2024] Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. I The Constitution entrusts state legislatures\nwith the primary responsibility for drawing congressional\ndistricts, and redistricting is an inescapably political\nenterprise. Legislators are almost always aware of the political\nramifications of the maps they adopt, and claims that a map is\nunconstitutional because it was drawn to achieve a partisan end are\nnot justiciable in federal court. Thus, as far as the Federal\nConstitution is concerned, a legislature may pursue partisan ends\nwhen it engages in redistricting. By contrast, if a legislature\ngives race a predominant role in redistricting decisions, the\nresulting map is subjected to strict scrutiny and may be held\nunconstitutional. These doctrinal lines collide when race and\npartisan preference are highly correlated. We have navigated this\ntension by endorsing two related propositions. First, a party\nchallenging a map's constitutionality must disentangle race and\npolitics if it wishes to prove that the legislature was motivated\nby race as opposed to partisanship. Second, in assessing a\nlegislature's work, we start with a presumption that the\nlegislature acted in good faith. In this case, which features a challenge to\nSouth Carolina's redistricting efforts in the wake of the 2020\ncensus, the three-judge District Court paid only lip service to\nthese propositions. That misguided approach infected the District\nCourt's findings of fact, which were clearly erroneous under the\nappropriate legal standard. We therefore reverse the trial court in\npart and remand for further proceedings. II A Redistricting constitutes a traditional domain\nof state legislative authority. See Moore v. Harper ,\n600 U.S. 1 (2023); see also U. S. Const., Art. I, §4, cl. 1. The\nFourteenth Amendment introduces one constraint by prohibiting a\nState from engaging in a racial gerrymander unless it can satisfy\nstrict scrutiny. But given “the complex interplay of forces that\nenter a legislature's redistricting calculus,” we have repeatedly\nemphasized that federal courts must “exercise extraordinary caution\nin adjudicating claims that a State has drawn district lines on the\nbasis of race.” Miller v. Johnson , 515 U.S.\n900 , 915-916 (1995). Such caution is necessary because\n“[f]ederal-court review of districting legislation represents a\nserious intrusion on the most vital of local functions.” Id. , at 915. To untangle race from other permissible\nconsiderations, we require the plaintiff to show that race was the\n“predominant factor motivating the legislature's decision to place\na significant number of voters within or without a particular\ndistrict.” Id. , at 916. To make that showing, a plaintiff must prove\nthat the State “subordinated” race-neutral districting criteria\nsuch as compactness, contiguity, and core preservation to “racial\nconsiderations.” Ibid. Racial considerations predominate\nwhen “[r]ace was the criterion that, in the State's view, could not\nbe compromised” in the drawing of district lines.[ 1 ] Shaw v. Hunt , 517 U.S.\n899 , 907 (1996). We have recognized that, “[a]s a practical\nmatter,” challengers will often need to show that the State's\nchosen map conflicts with traditional redistricting criteria. Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections , 580\nU.S. 178, 190 (2017). That is because it may otherwise “be\ndifficult for challengers to find other evidence sufficient to show\nthat race was the overriding factor causing neutral considerations\nto be cast aside.” Ibid. This showing can be made through some\ncombination of direct and circumstantial evidence. See Cooper v. Harris , 581 U.S. 285, 291 (2017). Direct\nevidence often comes in the form of a relevant state actor's\nexpress acknowledgment that race played a role in the drawing of\ndistrict lines. Such concessions are not uncommon because States\noften admit to considering race for the purpose of satisfying our\nprecedent interpreting the Voting Rights Act of 1965. See, e.g.,\nAlabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U.S.\n254, 259-260 (2015). Direct evidence can also be smoked out over\nthe course of litigation. In Cooper , for instance, we\noffered the hypothetical example of a plaintiff finding “scores of\nleaked e-mails from state officials instructing their mapmaker to\npack as many black voters as possible into a district.” 581 U. S.,\nat 318. In such instances, if the State cannot satisfy strict\nscrutiny, direct evidence of this sort amounts to a confession of\nerror. Proving racial predominance with circumstantial\nevidence alone is much more difficult. Although we have never\ninvalidated an electoral map in a case in which the plaintiff\nfailed to adduce any direct evidence, we have, at least in theory,\nkept the door open for those rare instances in which a district's\nshape is “so bizarre on its face that it discloses a racial design”\nabsent any alternative explanation. Miller , 515 U. S., at\n914; see also Shaw v. Reno , 509\nU.S. 630 , 643-645 (1993) ( Shaw I ). A circumstantial-evidence-only case is\nespecially difficult when the State raises a\npartisan-gerrymandering defense. That is because partisan and\nracial gerrymanders “are capable of yielding similar oddities in a\ndistrict's boundaries” when there is a high correlation between\nrace and partisan preference. Cooper , 581 U. S., at 308. And\nthat is the situation in this case, as the 2020 Presidential\nelection illustrated. Exit polls found that at least 90% of black\nvoters voted for the Democratic candidate in South Carolina and\nthroughout the Nation.[ 2 ] When\npartisanship and race correlate, it naturally follows that a map\nthat has been gerrymandered to achieve a partisan end can look very\nsimilar to a racially gerrymandered map. For that reason, “[o]ur\nprior decisions have made clear that a jurisdiction may engage in\nconstitutional political gerrymandering, even if it so happens that\nthe most loyal Democrats happen to be black Democrats and even if\nthe State were conscious of that fact.” Hunt v. Cromartie , 526 U.S.\n541 , 551 (1999) ( Cromartie I ); see also Rucho v. Common Cause , 588 U.S. 684, 721 (2019) (concluding that\nfederal judges lack the license to evaluate partisan-gerrymandering\nclaims). We have noted that a State's partisan-gerrymandering\ndefense therefore raises “special challenges” for plaintiffs. Cooper , 581 U. S., at 308. To prevail, a plaintiff must\n“disentangle race from politics” by proving “that the former drove a district's lines.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\nThat means, among other things, ruling out the competing\nexplanation that political considerations dominated the\nlegislature's redistricting efforts. If either politics or race\ncould explain a district's contours, the plaintiff has not cleared\nits bar. Our decision in Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.S.\n234 (2001) ( Cromartie II ), illustrates the difficulties\nthat plaintiffs must overcome in this context. There, the\nplaintiffs' case hinged on circumstantial evidence of a racial\ngerrymander such as expert testimony and discrepancies between the\nrelevant district lines and traditional districting criteria. Id. , at 240-241; see also Cooper , 581 U. S., at 321\n(describing the direct evidence in Cromartie II as\n“extremely weak”). After the State asserted a\npartisan-gerrymandering defense, we faulted the plaintiffs for\nfailing to show “that the legislature could have achieved its\nlegitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are\ncomparably consistent with traditional districting principles.” Cromartie II , 532 U. S., at 258. In other words, the\nplaintiffs failed to meet the high bar for a racial-gerrymandering\nclaim by failing to produce, among other things, an alternative map\nshowing that a rational legislature sincerely driven by its\nprofessed partisan goals would have drawn a different map with\ngreater racial balance. Since our decision in Cromartie II ,\nany plaintiff with a strong case has had every incentive to produce\nsuch an alternative map. Without an alternative map, it is difficult for\nplaintiffs to defeat our starting presumption that the legislature\nacted in good faith. This presumption of legislative good faith\ndirects district courts to draw the inference that cuts in the\nlegislature's favor when confronted with evidence that could\nplausibly support multiple conclusions. See, e.g., Abbott v. Perez , 585 U.S. 579, 610-612 (2018). This approach ensures\nthat “race for its own sake, and not other districting principles,\nwas the legislature's dominant and controlling rationale in drawing\nits district lines.” Miller , 515 U. S., at 913; see also Cromartie I , 526 U. S., at 546 (noting that strict scrutiny\nis warranted when a map is “unexplainable on grounds other than\nrace” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Three additional reasons justify this\npresumption. First, this presumption reflects the Federal\nJudiciary's due respect for the judgment of state legislators, who\nare similarly bound by an oath to follow the Constitution. Second,\nwhen a federal court finds that race drove a legislature's\ndistricting decisions, it is declaring that the legislature engaged\nin “offensive and demeaning” conduct, Miller , 515 U. S., at\n912, that “bears an uncomfortable resemblance to political\napartheid,” Shaw I , 509 U. S., at 647. We should not be\nquick to hurl such accusations at the political branches. Third, we\nmust be wary of plaintiffs who seek to transform federal courts\ninto “weapons of political warfare” that will deliver victories\nthat eluded them “in the political arena.” Cooper , 581 U.\nS., at 335 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment in part and\ndissenting in part). The presumption of good faith furthers each of\nthese constitutional interests. It also explains why we have held\nthat the plaintiff 's evidentiary burden in these cases is\nespecially stringent. See Cromartie II , 532 U. S., at\n241. If a plaintiff can demonstrate that race drove\nthe mapping of district lines, then the burden shifts to the State\nto prove that the map can overcome the daunting requirements of\nstrict scrutiny. Under this standard, we begin by asking whether\nthe State's decision to sort voters on the basis of race furthers a\ncompelling governmental interest. Cooper , 581 U. S., at 292.\nWe then determine whether the State's use of race is “narrowly\ntailored”— i.e. , “necessary”—to achieve that interest. This\nstandard is extraordinarily onerous because the Fourteenth\nAmendment was designed to eradicate race-based state action. Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and\nFellows of Harvard College , 600 U.S. 181, 206 (2023). B South Carolina has seven congressional\ndistricts, and this case concerns two of them, Districts 1 and 6.\nDistrict 1 covers the State's southeast region, while District 6\ncovers its southwest and central regions. South Carolina's prior\nmap, which was enacted in 2011, split several counties between\nDistricts 1 and 6, including Beaufort, Berkeley, Charleston,\nColleton, and Dorchester Counties. See Figure 1, infra , at\n11. The Department of Justice precleared the 2011 map, and a\nthree-judge District Court upheld it against racial-gerrymandering\nand intentional vote-dilution claims after finding that the\nlegislature “demonstrate[d] that [it] adhered to traditional\nrace-neutral principles.” Backus v. South Carolina ,\n857 F. Supp. 2d 553, 560 (SC), summarily aff 'd, 568 U.S. 801\n(2012). The relevant part of that map is shown in Figure 1, infra , at 11. Over the next decade, the 2011 map consistently\nyielded a 6-to-1 Republican-Democratic delegation—with one\nexception. In 2018, the Democratic candidate, with 50.7% of the\nvotes, narrowly won District 1, which had previously elected\nRepublican candidates.[ 3 ] But\nin 2020, when the Republican Presidential candidate handily won the\nState, the Republican congressional candidate retook District 1 by\na slender margin, winning 50.6% of the votes.[ 4 ] South Carolina had to redraw its map after the\n2020 census because two of the State's seven districts saw major\npopulation shifts. District 1 was overpopulated by 87,689 residents\nwhile District 6 was underpopulated by 84,741 residents. South\nCarolina therefore had to add voters to District 6 while\nsubtracting voters from District 1 in order to comply with the\nprinciple of one person, one vote. The remaining districts also had\nto be modified in order to bring the whole map into compliance with\nthat requirement. In September 2021, the Senate subcommittee\ntasked with drawing the new map issued guidance explaining that\ntraditional districting principles, such as respect for contiguity\nand incumbent protection, would guide the mapmaking process along\nwith the strict equal-population requirement. At the same time, the\nRepublican-controlled legislature also made it clear that it would\naim to create a stronger Republican tilt in District 1. Senate\nMajority Leader Shane Massey, for instance, testified at trial that\npartisanship was “one of the most important factors” in the process\nand that the Republican Party was “not going to pass a plan that\nsacrificed [District 1].” J. S. A. 265a. As he put it, the\nlegislature's adoption of any map that improved the Democrats'\nchance of reclaiming District 1 would constitute “political\nmalpractice.” Id., at 276a. Contemporaneous evidence\nconfirms that leaders in the legislature sought to “create a\nstronger Republican tilt” in District 1 while “honoring” other\nrace-neutral, traditional districting criteria. 649 F. Supp. 3d\n177, 187 (SC 2023); J. S. A. 333a-334a. To draw its maps, the Senate turned to Will\nRoberts, a nonpartisan staffer with 20 years of experience in state\ngovernment. Roberts had “worked with the three-judge panel in Backus ” and had routinely prepared “reapportionment plans\nfor counties, cities[,] and school boards across the state.” 649 F.\nSupp. 3d, at 188. During the trial of this case, one of the judges\npraised Roberts' expertise and honesty on the record.[ 5 ] Under the Senate's open-door policy,\nRoberts drew maps upon request for Republican and Democratic\nSenators alike. In making these maps, Roberts relied on political\ndata from the 2020 Presidential election along with traditional\ndistricting criteria and input from various lawmakers, including\nRepresentative Jim Clyburn, whose recommendations would have\npreserved the strong Democratic tilt in his district (District 6)\nand included a version of District 1 with a black voting-age\npopulation (BVAP) of 15.48%. J. S. A. 127a. The eventual map (Enacted Plan), see Figure 2, infra , at 12, differed from the 2011 map in three important\nrespects that reflected the legislature's priorities. First, the\nEnacted Plan unified Beaufort and Berkeley Counties within District\n1. This move enhanced the Republican advantage in District 1\nbecause the moved-in portions of those counties leaned Republican.\nSecond, to further increase the Republican lead in District 1,\nRoberts also put more of Dorchester County in District 1. These\nchanges exacerbated the population imbalance between District 1 and\nDistrict 6. Third, to cure this problem, Roberts moved a series of\nprecincts in Charleston from District 1 to District 6. In keeping\nwith the legislature's partisan objectives, the precincts moved out\nof District 1 had a 58.8% Democratic vote share. By design, the legislature divided Charleston\nbetween Districts 1 and 6. This split was seen as in Charleston's\nbest interests because it meant that the county would have two\nRepresentatives in the House—one Democrat, Representative Clyburn,\nwho has represented District 6 since 1993 and has held important\nHouse leadership positions, and one Republican representing\nDistrict 1. Republican Senator Chip Campsen, who spearheaded the\nmapmaking process, testified that Charleston benefits from\nbipartisan congressional representation on “bread-and-butter\nthings” like port maintenance and “influence with the incumbent\nadministration.” Id., at 338a. As he explained, “I am\ntickled to death that Jim Clyburn represents Charleston County,” id ., at 371a, because “Clyburn has more influence with the\nBiden Administration perhaps than anyone in the nation,” id ., at 338a. To achieve all these objectives, Roberts moved\nroughly 193,000 residents between the districts with a net\nmigration of 87,690 people into District 6. Id ., at 439a,\n443a. The Enacted Map achieved the legislature's\npolitical goal by increasing District 1's projected Republican vote\nshare by 1.36% to 54.39%. The version of District 1 in the Enacted\nPlan also had a slightly higher BVAP, rising from 16.56% to 16.72%.\nThe legislature voted to adopt the Enacted Plan, and the Governor\nsigned it into law in January 2022. While the Enacted Map was still in the making,\nthe plaintiff-appellees in this case—the National Association for\nthe Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Taiwan Scott, a voter\nin District 1 (collectively, the Challengers)—sued to contest the\n2011 map on the ground that, in light of the 2020 census, it\nviolated the one person, one vote requirement. After South Carolina\npassed the Enacted Plan, the Challengers amended their complaint to\nattack that map instead. The Challengers alleged that Districts 1,\n2, and 5 were racially gerrymandered and that these districts\ndiluted the electoral power of the State's black voters. A\nthree-judge District Court rejected these claims with respect to\nDistricts 2 and 5. But the court held that South Carolina drew\nDistrict 1 with a 17% BVAP “target” in mind and that this violated\nthe Equal Protection Clause. For similar reasons, the court also\nfound that the State's putative use of race to draw District 1\nunlawfully diluted the black vote. The court permanently enjoined\nSouth Carolina from conducting elections in District 1 until it\napproved a new map. The State appealed to this Court, and we noted\nprobable jurisdiction. 598 U. S. ___ (2023). III The State contends that the District Court\ncommitted both legal error and clear factual error in concluding\nthat race played a predominant role in the legislature's design of\nDistrict 1. The State's principal legal argument is that the\nDistrict Court did not properly disentangle race from politics.\nBecause this argument, at bottom, attacks the factual basis of the\nDistrict Court's findings, we dispose of this case on clear-error\ngrounds. Under our case law, the Challengers bore the\nburden of showing that the “legislature subordinated traditional\nrace-neutral districting principles . . . to racial\nconsiderations.” Miller , 515 U. S., at 916. In this case,\nthe District Court clearly erred because the Challengers did not\nmeet this “demanding” standard. Id. , at 928 (O'Connor, J.,\nconcurring). They provided no direct evidence of a racial\ngerrymander, and their circumstantial evidence is very weak.\nInstead, the Challengers relied on deeply flawed expert reports.\nAnd while these experts produced tens of thousands of maps with\ndifferently configured districts, they did not offer a single map\nthat achieved the legislature's partisan goal while including a\nhigher BVAP in District 1. Faced with this record, we must reverse\nthe District Court on the racial-gerrymandering claim. We divide our analysis into four parts. First,\nwe set out the appropriate legal standard for reviewing a district\ncourt's factual findings in racial-gerrymandering cases. Second, we\nexplain why the District Court's factual findings are clearly\nflawed with respect to the Challengers' circumstantial evidence.\nThird, we examine the four expert reports that the Challengers\npresented below. And finally, we explain that the District Court\nerred by not drawing an adverse inference from the Challengers'\nfailure to submit an alternative map that would have allowed the\nState to achieve its districting goals while maintaining a higher\nBVAP in District 1. A We review the District Court's factual\nfindings for clear error. That means we may not set those findings\naside unless, after examining the entire record, we are “left with\nthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\ncommitted.” Cooper , 581 U. S., at 309 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). This is a demanding test, but it is not a rubber\nstamp. Moreover, in a case like this, there is a\nspecial danger that a misunderstanding of what the law requires may\ninfect what is labeled a finding of fact. “[I]f [a] trial court\nbases its findings upon a mistaken impression of applicable legal\nprinciples, the reviewing court is not bound by the clearly\nerroneous standard.” Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives\nLaboratories, Inc. , 456 U.S.\n844 , 855, n. 15 (1982); see also Abbott , 585 U. S., at\n607. Here, the standard of proof that the three-judge court was\nrequired to apply, i.e. , the racial-predominance test, has a\nvery substantial legal component that must take account of our\nprior relevant decisions.[ 6 ]\nAnd the",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus MULDROW v. CITY OF ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI,\net al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the eighth circuit No. 22–193. Argued December 6, 2023—Decided\nApril 17, 2024 Sergeant Jatonya Clayborn Muldrow maintains\nthat her employer, the St. Louis Police Department,\ntransferred her from one job to another because she is a woman.\nFrom 2008 through 2017, Muldrow worked as a plainclothes officer in\nthe Department’s specialized Intelligence Division. In 2017, the\nnew Intelligence Division commander asked to transfer Muldrow out\nof the unit so he could replace her with a male police officer.\nAgainst Muldrow’s wishes, the Department approved the request and\nreassigned Muldrow to a uniformed job elsewhere in the Department.\nWhile Muldrow’s rank and pay remained the same in the new position,\nher responsibilities, perks, and schedule did not. After the\ntransfer, Muldrow no longer worked with high-ranking officials on\nthe departmental priorities lodged in the Intelligence Division,\ninstead supervising the day-to-day activities of neighborhood\npatrol officers. She also lost access to an unmarked take-home\nvehicle and had a less regular schedule involving weekend\nshifts. Muldrow brought this Title VII suit to\nchallenge the transfer. She alleged that the City, in ousting her\nfrom the Intelligence Division, had “discriminate[d] against” her\nbased on sex “with respect to” the “terms [or] conditions” of her\nemployment. 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1). The District\nCourt granted the City summary judgment. The Eighth Circuit\naffirmed, holding that Muldrow had to—but could not—show that the\ntransfer caused her a “materially significant disadvantage.” 30 F.\n4th 680, 688. Muldrow’s lawsuit could not proceed, the court said,\nbecause the transfer “did not result in a diminution to her title,\nsalary, or benefits” and had caused “only minor changes in working\nconditions.” Held : An employee challenging a job\ntransfer under Title VII must show that the transfer brought about\nsome harm with respect to an identifiable term or condition of\nemployment, but that harm need not be significant. Pp. 5–11. (a) Title VII makes it unlawful for an\nemployer “to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,\nor otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to\nhis compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\nbecause of such individual’s . . . sex.” §2000e–2(a)(1).\nBoth parties agree that Muldrow’s transfer implicated “terms” and\n“conditions” of Muldrow’s employment. The applicable statutory\nlanguage thus prohibits “discriminat[ing] against” an individual\n“with respect to” the “terms [or] conditions” of employment because\nof that individual’s sex. That language requires Muldrow to show that\nher transfer brought about some “disadvantageous” change in an\nemployment term or condition. Oncale v. Sundowner\nOffshore Services, Inc. , 523 U.S.\n75 , 80. The words “discriminate against,” the Court has\nexplained, refer to “differences in treatment that injure”\nemployees. Bostock v. Clayton County , 590 U.S. 644,\n681. In the typical transfer case, that worse treatment must be\n“with respect to” employment “terms [or] conditions.”\n§2000e–2(a)(1). The “terms [or] conditions” phrase is not used “in\nthe narrow contractual sense”; it covers more than the “economic or\ntangible.” Oncale , 523 U. S., at 78; Meritor Savings\nBank, FSB v. Vinson , 477 U.S.\n57 , 64. Still, the phrase circumscribes the injuries that can\ngive rise to a suit like this one. To make out a Title VII\ndiscrimination claim, a transferee must show some harm respecting\nan identifiable term or condition of employment. What the transferee does not have to show is\nthat the harm incurred was “significant” or otherwise exceeded some\nheightened bar. “Discriminate against” means treat worse, here\nbased on sex. See, e.g. , Bostock , 590 U. S., at\n657. Neither that phrase nor any other establishes an elevated\nthreshold of harm. To demand “significance” is to add words to the\nstatute Congress enacted. It is to impose a new requirement on a\nTitle VII claimant, so that the law as applied demands something\nmore than the law as written. That difference can make a real\ndifference for complaining transferees. By asking whether the harm\nto the transferee is significant, appellate courts have disregarded\nvaried kinds of disadvantage. Pp. 5–7. (b) The City’s three main arguments—based on\nstatutory text, precedent, and policy—do not justify the use of a\n“significance” standard. The Court rejects the City’s textual claim,\nwhich invokes the ejusdem generis canon—the idea that a\ngeneral phrase following an enumeration of things should be read to\nencompass only things of the same basic kind. Applying that canon\nto the text of Title VII’s anti-discrimination provision, the City\nclaims that because refusing to hire or discharging a person causes\na significant disadvantage, the “otherwise to discriminate against”\nphrase can apply only to things causing an equal level of harm. But\nthe statutory text itself provides a different shared trait: Each\nkind of prohibited discrimination occurs by way of an employment\naction—whether pertaining to hiring, or firing, or compensating, or\n(as here) altering terms or conditions through a transfer. That is\na more than sufficient basis to unite the provision’s several parts\nand avoid ejusdem generis problems. Contrary to the City’s view, there is also no\nreason to import a significant-harm requirement from this Court’s\ndecision in Burlington N. & S. F. R. Co. v. White , 548 U.S.\n53 . The Court there held that Title VII’s anti-retaliation\nprovision—which prohibits an employer from taking action against an\nemployee for bringing or aiding a Title VII charge—applies only\nwhen the retaliatory action is “materially adverse,” meaning that\nit causes “significant” harm. Id. , at 68. White adopted that standard for reasons peculiar to the retaliation\ncontext. The test was meant to capture those employer actions\nserious enough to “dissuade[ ] a reasonable worker from making\nor supporting a charge of discrimination.” Ibid. An action\ncausing less serious harm will not deter Title VII enforcement and\nso falls outside the purposes of the ban on retaliation. But that\nreasoning does not apply to the anti-discrimination provision,\nwhich flatly “prevent[s] injury to individuals based on” protected\nstatus, id., at 63, without distinguishing between\nsignificant and less significant harms. Finally, there is reason to doubt the City’s\nprediction that employees will flood courts with litigation in the\nabsence of a significant-injury requirement. Courts retain multiple\nways to dispose of meritless Title VII claims challenging transfer\ndecisions. But even supposing the City’s worst predictions come\ntrue, that would be the result of the statute Congress drafted.\nThis Court will not add words to the statute to achieve what the\nCity thinks a desirable result. Pp. 8–10. (c) The courts below applied the wrong\nstandard to Muldrow’s suit. Muldrow need show only some injury\nrespecting her employment terms or conditions. Her allegations, if\nproperly preserved and supported, meet that test with room to\nspare. The Court recognizes, however, that the decisions below may\nhave rested in part on issues of forfeiture and proof. The Court\nleaves such matters for the courts below to address on remand under\nthe proper Title VII standard. Pp. 10–11. 30 F. 4th 680, vacated and remanded. Kagan, J., delivered the opinion of the Court,\nin which Roberts, C. J., and Sotomayor, Gorsuch, Barrett, and\nJackson, JJ., joined. Thomas, J., Alito, J., and Kavanaugh, J.,\neach filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 22–193 _________________ Jatonya Clayborn Muldrow, PETITIONER v. City of St. Louis, Missouri, et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the eighth circuit [April 17, 2024] Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. Sergeant Jatonya Clayborn Muldrow maintains that\nher employer, the St. Louis Police Department, transferred her from\none job to another because she is a woman. She sued the City of St.\nLouis under Title VII, alleging that she had suffered sex\ndiscrimination with respect to the “terms [or] conditions” of her\nemployment. 42 U. S. C. §2000e–2(a)(1). The courts below\nrejected the claim on the ground that the transfer did not cause\nMuldrow a “significant” employment disadvantage. Other courts have\nused similar standards in addressing Title VII suits arising from\njob transfers. Today, we disapprove that approach. Although an\nemployee must show some harm from a forced transfer to prevail in a\nTitle VII suit, she need not show that the injury satisfies a\nsignificance test. Title VII’s text nowhere establishes that high\nbar. I From 2008 through 2017, Sergeant Muldrow\nworked as a plainclothes officer in the St. Louis Police\nDepartment’s specialized Intelligence Division. During her tenure\nthere, she investigated public corruption and human trafficking\ncases, oversaw the Gang Unit, and served as head of the Gun Crimes\nUnit. By virtue of her Division position, Muldrow was also\ndeputized as a Task Force Officer with the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation—a status granting her, among other things, FBI\ncredentials, an unmarked take-home vehicle, and the authority to\npursue investigations outside St. Louis. In 2017, the outgoing\ncommander of the Intelligence Division told her newly appointed\nsuccessor that Muldrow was a “workhorse”—still more, that “if there\nwas one sergeant he could count on in the Division,” it was\nMuldrow. 2020 WL 5505113, *1 (ED Mo., Sept. 11, 2020). But the new Intelligence Division commander,\nCaptain Michael Deeba, instead asked the Department to transfer\nMuldrow out of the unit. Deeba wanted to replace Muldrow—whom he\nsometimes called “Mrs.” rather than the customary “Sergeant”—with a\nmale police officer. See id., at *1–*2. That officer, Deeba\nlater testified, seemed a better fit for the Division’s “very\ndangerous” work. Id ., at *2; App. 139. The Department\napproved the transfer against Muldrow’s wishes. It reassigned her\nto a uniformed job in the Department’s Fifth District. While Muldrow’s rank and pay remained the same\nin the new position, her responsibilities, perks, and schedule did\nnot. Instead of working with high-ranking officials on the\ndepartmental priorities lodged in the Intelligence Division,\nMuldrow now supervised the day-to-day activities of neighborhood\npatrol officers. Her new duties included approving their arrests,\nreviewing their reports, and handling other administrative matters;\nshe also did some patrol work herself. Because she no longer served\nin the Intelligence Division, she lost her FBI status and the car\nthat came with it. And the change of jobs made Muldrow’s workweek\nless regular. She had worked a traditional Monday-through-Friday\nweek in the Intelligence Division. Now she was placed on a\n“rotating schedule” that often involved weekend shifts. 2020 WL\n5505113, *2. Muldrow brought this Title VII suit to challenge\nthe transfer. Her complaint alleged that the City, in ousting her\nfrom the Intelligence Division, had “discriminate[d] against” her\nbased on sex “with respect to” the “terms [or] conditions” of her\nemployment. §2000e–2(a)(1). In later deposition testimony, Muldrow\nset out her view of what the transfer had cost her. She had been\nmoved out of a “premier position [in] the Police Department” into a\nless “prestigious” and more “administrative” uniformed role. App.\n105, 114, 120. She had fewer “opportunities” to work on “important\ninvestigations,” as well as to “network” with commanding officers. Id ., at 104. And she lost material benefits—her weekday work\nschedule and take-home car. Or as she summarized the situation: “I\nwent from straight days, weekends off with a take-home car and more\nvisibility and responsibility within the Department to a rotating\nschedule with few weekends off, assigned to . . .\nuniformed patrol,” with “responsibilities being limited to that of\nadministrative work” and “supervising officers on patrol.” Id ., at 120. Title VII, Muldrow asserted in her suit,\nprevented the City from making those changes to her employment\nbecause of her sex. The District Court, viewing the matter\ndifferently, granted the City summary judgment. Under Circuit\nprecedent, the court explained, Muldrow needed to show that her\ntransfer effected a “significant” change in working conditions\nproducing “material employment disadvantage.” 2020 WL 5505113,\n*8–*9. And Muldrow, the court held, could not meet that\nheightened-injury standard. “[S]he experienced no change in salary\nor rank.” Id., at *9. Her loss of “the networking\n[opportunities] available in Intelligence” was immaterial because\nshe had not provided evidence that it had harmed her “career\nprospects.” Id., at *8. And given her continued “supervisory\nrole,” she had not “suffered a significant alteration to her work\nresponsibilities.” Id., at *9. Finally, the District Court\nconcluded that the switch to a rotating schedule (including weekend\nwork) and the loss of a take-home vehicle could not fill the gap.\nAlthough mentioning those changes “in her statement of facts,”\nMuldrow had not relied on them in “her argument against summary\njudgment.” Ibid. , n. 20. And anyway, the court stated,\nthey “appear to be minor alterations of employment, rather than\nmaterial harms.” Ibid. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit\naffirmed. It agreed that Muldrow had to—but could not—show that the\ntransfer caused a “materially significant disadvantage.” 30 F. 4th\n680, 688 (2022). Like the District Court, the Eighth Circuit\nemphasized that the transfer “did not result in a diminution to her\ntitle, salary, or benefits.” Id., at 688–689. And the\nCircuit, too, maintained that the change in her job\nresponsibilities was “insufficient” to support a Title VII claim. Id., at 689. In the Fifth District, the court reasoned,\nMuldrow still had a “supervisory role” and participated in\ninvestigating serious crimes. Id., at 688. So the court\nthought Muldrow’s view of the new job—“more administrative and less\nprestigious”—was unsupported by record evidence and not\n“persuasive.” Ibid. The court did not address Muldrow’s new\nschedule or her loss of a car, apparently thinking those matters\neither forfeited or too slight to mention. Overall, the court held,\nMuldrow’s claim could not proceed because she had experienced “only\nminor changes in working conditions.” Ibid. We granted certiorari, 600 U. S. ___\n(2023), to resolve a Circuit split over whether an employee\nchallenging a transfer under Title VII must meet a heightened\nthreshold of harm—be it dubbed significant, serious, or something\nsimilar.[ 1 ] We now vacate the\njudgment below because the text of Title VII imposes no such\nrequirement. II A Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer\n“to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or\notherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to\nhis compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or\nnational origin.” §2000e–2(a)(1). Muldrow’s suit, as described\nabove, alleges that she was transferred to a lesser position\nbecause she is a woman. That transfer, as both parties agree,\nimplicated “terms” and “conditions” of Muldrow’s employment,\nchanging nothing less than the what, where, and when of her police\nwork. See Brief for Muldrow 19; Brief for City 1, 45–46. So the\nstatutory language applicable to this case prohibits\n“discriminat[ing] against” an individual “with respect to” the\n“terms [or] conditions” of employment because of that individual’s\nsex. That language requires Muldrow to show that the\ntransfer brought about some “disadvantageous” change in an\nemployment term or condition. Oncale v. Sundowner\nOffshore Services, Inc. , 523 U.S.\n75 , 80 (1998). The words “discriminate against,” we have\nexplained, refer to “differences in treatment that injure”\nemployees. Bostock v. Clayton County , 590 U.S. 644,\n681 (2020). Or otherwise said, the statute targets practices that\n“treat[ ] a person worse” because of sex or other protected\ntrait. Id., at 658. And in the typical transfer case, that\n“worse” treatment must pertain to—must be “with respect\nto”—employment “terms [or] conditions.” §2000e–2(a)(1). The “terms\n[or] conditions” phrase, we have made clear, is not used “in the\nnarrow contractual sense”; it covers more than the “economic or\ntangible.” Oncale , 523 U. S., at 78; Meritor Savings\nBank, FSB v. Vinson , 477 U.S.\n57 , 64 (1986). Still, the phrase circumscribes the injuries\nthat can give rise to a suit like this one. To make out a Title VII\ndiscrimination claim, a transferee must show some harm respecting\nan identifiable term or condition of employment. What the transferee does not have to show,\naccording to the relevant text, is that the harm incurred was\n“significant.” 30 F. 4th, at 688. Or serious, or substantial, or\nany similar adjective suggesting that the disadvantage to the\nemployee must exceed a heightened bar. See supra, at 4, and\n4–5, n. 1. “Discriminate against” means treat worse, here\nbased on sex. See, e.g. , Bostock , 590 U. S., at\n657–658, 681. But neither that phrase nor any other says anything\nabout how much worse. There is nothing in the provision to\ndistinguish, as the courts below did, between transfers causing\nsignificant disadvantages and transfers causing not-so-significant\nones. And there is nothing to otherwise establish an elevated\nthreshold of harm. To demand “significance” is to add words—and\nsignificant words, as it were—to the statute Congress enacted. It\nis to impose a new requirement on a Title VII claimant, so that the\nlaw as applied demands something more of her than the law as\nwritten. And that difference can make a real difference\nfor complaining transferees. Many forced transfers leave workers\nworse off respecting employment terms or conditions. (After all, a\ntransfer is not usually forced when it leaves the employee better\noff.) But now add another question—whether the harm is significant.\nAs appellate decisions reveal, the answers can lie in the eye of\nthe beholder—and can disregard varied kinds of disadvantage. Take\njust a few examples from the caselaw. An engineering technician is\nassigned to work at a new job site—specifically, a 14-by-22-foot\nwind tunnel; a court rules that the transfer does not have a\n“significant detrimental effect.” Boone v. Goldin , 178 F.3d 253 , 256 (CA4 1999). A shipping worker is required to\ntake a position involving only nighttime work; a court decides that\nthe assignment does not “constitute a significant change in\nemployment.” Daniels v. United Parcel Serv., Inc. ,\n701 F.3d 620, 635 (CA10 2012). And a school principal is forced\ninto a non-school-based administrative role supervising fewer\nemployees; a court again finds the change in job duties not\n“significant.” Cole v. Wake Cty. Bd. of Educ. , 834\nFed. Appx. 820, 821 (CA4 2021) ( per curiam ). All those\nemployees suffered some injury in employment terms or conditions\n(allegedly because of race or sex). Their claims were rejected\nsolely because courts rewrote Title VII, compelling workers to make\na showing that the statutory text does not require.[ 2 ] B The City, in defense of that added\nrequirement, makes three main arguments—one about the text, one\nabout our precedent, and one about policy. None justifies the use\nof a “significance” standard. The textual claim invokes the ejusdem\ngeneris canon—the idea that a general phrase following an\nenumeration of things should be read to encompass only things of\nthe same basic kind. Recall the prohibition at issue here: An\nemployer may not, based on sex, “fail or refuse to hire” or\n“discharge” any person or “otherwise . . . discriminate\nagainst [her] with respect to [her] compensation, terms,\nconditions, or privileges of employment.” §2000e–2(a)(1); see supra , at 5. Refusing to hire or discharging a person, the\nCity notes, causes a significant disadvantage; so the subsequent\n“otherwise” phrase, the City claims, can apply only to things\ncausing an equal level of harm. See Brief for City 16, 25–27. But\nthe City fails to explain why the presence of significant\ndisadvantage must be part of the list’s common denominator. The\ntext itself provides a different shared trait. Each kind of\nprohibited discrimination occurs by way of an employment\naction—whether pertaining to hiring, or firing, or compensating, or\n(as here) altering terms or conditions through a transfer. That is\na more than sufficient basis to unite the provision’s several parts\nand avoid ejusdem generis problems. There is no need for\ncourts to introduce a significant-harm requirement. The City’s argument from precedent fares no\nbetter. It relies on Burlington Northern & Santa Fe\nRailway Co. v. White , 548 U.S.\n53 (2006), which addressed Title VII’s separate\nanti-retaliation provision. Under that section, an employer may not\ntake action against an employee for bringing or aiding a Title VII\ncharge. See §2000e–3(a). The Court held that the provision applies\nonly when the retaliatory action is “materially adverse,” meaning\nthat it causes “significant” harm. Id ., at 68. The City\nthinks we should import the same standard into the\nanti-discrimination provision at issue. See Brief for City 18–19.\nBut that would create a mismatch. White adopted the standard\nfor reasons peculiar to the retaliation context. The test was meant\nto capture those (and only those) employer actions serious enough\nto “dissuade[ ] a reasonable worker from making or supporting\na charge of discrimination.” 548 U. S., at 68. If an action\ncauses less serious harm, the Court reasoned, it will not deter\nTitle VII enforcement; and if it will not deter Title VII\nenforcement, it falls outside the purposes of the ban on\nretaliation. See id. , at 63, 68. But no such (frankly\nextra-textual) reasoning is applicable to the discrimination bar.\nWhether an action causes significant enough harm to deter any\nemployee conduct is there beside the point. White itself\nnoted the difference: The anti-discrimination provision, we\nexplained, simply “seeks a workplace where individuals are not\ndiscriminated against” because of traits like race and sex. Id., at 63. The provision thus flatly “prevent[s] injury to\nindividuals based on” status, ibid. , without distinguishing\nbetween significant and less significant harms. Finally, the City’s policy objections cannot\noverride Title VII’s text. In the City’s view, a significant-injury\nrequirement is needed to prevent transferred employees from\n“swamp[ing] courts and employers” with insubstantial lawsuits\nrequiring “burdensome discovery and trials.” Brief for City 45, 49\n(capitalization and boldface omitted). But there is reason to doubt\nthat the floodgates will open in the way feared. As we have\nexplained, the anti-discrimination provision at issue requires that\nthe employee show some injury. See supra , at 5–6. It\nrequires that the injury asserted concern the terms or conditions\nof her employment. See ibid. Perhaps most notably, it\nrequires that the employer have acted for discriminatory\nreasons—“because of ” sex or race or other protected trait.\n§2000e–2(a)(1). And in addressing that issue, a court may consider\nwhether a less harmful act is, in a given context, less suggestive\nof intentional discrimination. So courts retain multiple ways to\ndispose of meritless Title VII claims challenging transfer\ndecisions. But even supposing the City’s worst predictions come\ntrue, that would be the result of the statute Congress drafted. As\nwe noted in another Title VII decision, we will not “add words to\nthe law” to achieve what some employers might think “a desirable\nresult.” EEOC v. Abercrombie & Fitch Stores,\nInc. , 575 U.S.\n768 , 774 (2015). Had Congress wanted to limit liability for job\ntransfers to those causing a significant disadvantage, it could\nhave done so. By contrast, this Court does not get to make that\njudgment. III In light of everything said above, the Court\nof Appeals’ treatment of Muldrow’s suit cannot survive. The court\nrequired Muldrow to show that the allegedly discriminatory transfer\nout of the Intelligence Division produced a significant employment\ndisadvantage. See supra , at 4. As we have explained, that is\nthe wrong standard. Muldrow need show only some injury respecting\nher employment terms or conditions. The transfer must have left her\nworse off, but need not have left her significantly so. And\nMuldrow’s allegations, if properly preserved and supported, meet\nthat test with room to spare. Recall her principal allegations. She\nwas moved from a plainclothes job in a prestigious specialized\ndivision giving her substantial responsibility over priority\ninvestigations and frequent opportunity to work with police\ncommanders. She was moved to a uniformed job supervising one\ndistrict’s patrol officers, in which she was less involved in\nhigh-visibility matters and primarily performed administrative\nwork. Her schedule became less regular, often requiring her to work\nweekends; and she lost her take-home car. If those allegations are\nproved, she was left worse off several times over. It does not\nmatter, as the courts below thought (and Justice Thomas echoes),\nthat her rank and pay remained the same, or that she still could\nadvance to other jobs. See supra, at 3–4; post, at 2.\nTitle VII prohibits making a transfer, based on sex, with the\nconsequences Muldrow described. We recognize, however, that the decisions below\nmay have rested in part on issues of forfeiture and proof. The\nDistrict Court noted, for example, that Muldrow had failed to\ndiscuss in her argument against summary judgment the changes in her\nwork schedule and vehicle access; and perhaps following that lead,\nthe Court of Appeals did not address those harms. See supra ,\nat 3–4. In addition, both courts suggested that some of the\nallegations Muldrow made about the nature of the work she did in\nher old and new jobs lacked adequate evidentiary support. See ibid . We leave such matters for the courts below to address.\nAll we require is that they use the proper Title VII standard, and\nnot demand that Muldrow demonstrate her transfer caused\n“significant” harm. We accordingly vacate the judgment of the Court\nof Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and remand the case for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Notes 1 Compare, e . g ., 30 F. 4th 680, 688 (CA8 2022) (case below)\n(“materially significant disadvantage”); Caraballo-Caraballo v. Correctional Admin. , 892 F.3d 53, 61 (CA1 2018)\n(“materially changes” employment conditions in a manner “more\ndisruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job\nresponsibilities”); Williams v. R. H. Donnelley,\nCorp. , 368 F.3d 123 , 128 (CA2 2004) (“materially significant\ndisadvantage”); James v. Booz-Allen & Hamilton,\nInc. , 368 F.3d 371 , 376 (CA4 2004) (“significant detrimental\neffect”); O’Neal v. Chicago , 392 F.3d 909 , 911 (CA7 2004) (“materially adverse”); Sanchez v. Denver Public Schools , 164 F.3d 527 , 532 (CA10 1998) (“significant change”); and Webb-Edwards v. Orange Cty. Sheriff ’s Office ,\n525 F.3d 1013, 1033 (CA11 2008) (“serious and material change”),\nwith Chambers v. District of Columbia , 35 F. 4th\n870, 872, 876–877 (CADC 2022) (en banc) (overruling precedent that\ndemanded an “objectively tangible harm” and rejecting a “material\nadversity” requirement). 2 Justice Thomas’s\nconcurring opinion appears to disagree in two respects. He\ninitially disputes that courts have applied a heightened-harm\nrequirement in demanding that a plaintiff show something like\n“materially significant disadvantage.” See post, at 1\n(opinion concurring in judgment). And as a corollary, he denies\nthat courts will have to change their treatment of Title VII claims\nonce they start to apply the simple injury standard set out in this\nopinion. See post, at 2–3. In light of those views, we\nunderscore two points. First, this decision changes the legal\nstandard used in any circuit that has previously required\n“significant,” “material,” or “serious” injury. It lowers the bar\nTitle VII plaintiffs must meet. Second, because it does so, many\ncases will come out differently. The decisions described above are\nexamples, intended to illustrate how claims that failed under a\nsignificance standard should now succeed. And as we will discuss,\nthe decision below is another such example, putting to one side\ncase-specific issues of forfeiture and proof. See infra , at\n10–11.",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION et al. v. FIKRE certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit No. 22–1178. Argued January 8, 2024—Decided\nMarch 19, 2024 Respondent Yonas Fikre, a U. S. citizen\nand Sudanese emigree, brought suit alleging that the government\nplaced him on the No Fly List unlawfully. In his complaint, Mr.\nFikre alleged that he traveled from his home in Portland, Oregon to\nSudan in 2009 to pursue business opportunities there. At a visit to\nthe U. S. embassy, two FBI agents informed Mr. Fikre that he\ncould not return to the United States because the government had\nplaced him on the No Fly List. The agents questioned him\nextensively about the Portland mosque he attended, and they offered\nto take steps to remove him from the No Fly List if he agreed to\nbecome an FBI informant and to report on other members of his\nreligious community. Mr. Fikre refused. He then traveled to the\nUnited Arab Emirates, where he alleges authorities interrogated and\ndetained him for 106 days at the behest of the FBI. Unable to fly\nback to the United States, he ended up in Sweden, where he remained\nuntil February 2015. While there, he filed this suit, alleging that\nthe government had violated his rights to procedural due process by\nfailing to provide either meaningful notice of his addition to the\nNo Fly List or any appropriate way to secure redress. He further\nalleged that the government had placed him on the list for\nconstitutionally impermissible reasons related to his race,\nnational origin, and religious beliefs. Mr. Fikre sought, among\nother things, an injunction prohibiting the government from keeping\nhim on the No Fly List and a declaratory judgment confirming the\ngovernment had violated his rights. In May 2016, the government\nnotified Mr. Fikre that he had been removed from the No Fly List\nand sought dismissal of his suit in district court, arguing that\nits administrative action had rendered the case moot. The district\ncourt agreed with the government, but the Ninth Circuit reversed,\nholding that a party seeking to moot a case based on its own\nvoluntary cessation of challenged conduct must show that the\nconduct cannot “reasonably be expected to recur.” 904 F.3d 1033,\n1039. On remand, the government submitted a declaration asserting\nthat, based on the currently available information, Mr. Fikre would\nnot be placed on the No Fly List in the future, and the district\ncourt again dismissed Mr. Fikre’s claim as moot. The Ninth Circuit\nonce again reversed, holding that the government had failed to meet\nits burden because the declaration did not disclose the conduct\nthat landed Mr. Fikre on the No Fly List and did not ensure that he\nwould not be placed back on the list for engaging in the same or\nsimilar conduct in the future. 35 F. 4th 762, 770–772. Held : The government has failed to\ndemonstrate that this case is moot. A court with jurisdiction has a\n“virtually unflagging obligation” to hear and resolve questions\nproperly before it. Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States , 424 U.S.\n800 , 817 (1976). But the converse is also true as a federal\ncourt must dismiss a case that is moot. Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc. , 568 U.S.\n85 , 91 (2013). The limited authority vested in federal courts\nby Article III of the U. S. Constitution to decide cases and\ncontroversies means that federal courts may no more pronounce on\npast actions that have no “continuing effect” in the world than\nthey may neglect their obligation to hear and resolve questions\nproperly before them. Spencer v. Kemna , 523 U.S.\n1 , 18. This does not imply that a defendant may “automatically\nmoot a case” by the simple expedient of suspending its challenged\nconduct after it is sued. Instead, a defendant’s “voluntary\ncessation of a challenged practice” will moot a case only if the\ndefendant can show that the practice cannot “reasonably be expected\nto recur.” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw\nEnvironmental Services (TOC), Inc. , 528\nU.S. 167 , 189. This standard holds for governmental defendants\nno less than for private ones. Applying these principles to the\nuncontested factual allegations here, this case is not moot. While\nthe government’s representation that it will not relist Mr. Fikre\nmay mean that his past conduct is not enough to warrant relisting,\nthat does not speak to whether the government might relist him if\nhe engages in the same or similar conduct in the future. The\ngovernment contends that because Mr. Fikre has been delisted since\n2016 and has presumably interacted freely with his co-religionists\nduring that time, it is unlikely he will face relisting in the\nfuture. This too is insufficient to warrant dismissal. A\ndefendant’s speculation about a plaintiff’s actions cannot make up\nfor a lack of assurance about its own. The burden here is on the\ndefendant to establish that it cannot reasonably be expected to\nresume its challenged conduct, see West Virginia v. EPA , 597 U.S. 697, 719, and nothing the government offers\nhere satisfies that formidable standard. The government claims the\nNinth Circuit erred by requiring it to repudiate its past conduct\nto prove mootness, but what matters is not whether a defendant\nrepudiates its past actions, but what the defendant can prove about\nits future conduct. Coming as this case does in a preliminary\nposture, the Court’s judgment is a necessarily provisional one. As\nthe complaint’s allegations are tested, different facts may emerge\nthat may call for a different result. But adhering to traditional\nmootness principles, the government has so far failed to meet its\nburden. Pp. 5–10. 35 F. 4th 762, affirmed. Gorsuch, J., delivered the opinion for a\nunanimous Court. Alito, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which\nKavanaugh, J., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 22–1178 _________________ FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, et al.,\nPETITIONERS v. YONAS FIKRE on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit [March 19, 2024] Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. Yonas Fikre, a U. S. citizen, brought suit\nalleging that the government placed him on the No Fly List\nunlawfully. Later, the government removed him from the list. The\nonly question we are asked to decide is whether the government’s\naction suffices to render Mr. Fikre’s claims moot. I A In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001,\nterrorist attacks, the federal government rapidly expanded its No\nFly List. By 2016, the government forbade approximately 81,000\nindividuals from flying into, out of, within, or over the United\nStates. Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 5. Many of the details surrounding the No Fly\nList are not publicly available. Some are classified, and it\nappears no statute or publicly promulgated regulation describes the\nstandards the government employs when adding individuals to, or\nremoving them from, the list. Id. , at 6. In his complaint, Mr. Fikre challenged his\nplacement on the No Fly List. In support of his suit, he pleaded a\nnumber of facts. Those as-yet uncontested factual allegations, the\ntruth of which we do not pass upon, aver as follows:[ 1 ] When he was a child and war broke out in his\nhome country of Eritrea, Mr. Fikre and his family moved to Sudan\nbefore eventually immigrating to the United States. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 126a, Seventh Amended Complaint ¶4; id. , at 137a,\n¶51. In time, Mr. Fikre became a U. S. citizen, and as an adult he\nlived in Portland, Oregon. Id. , at 137a–138a, ¶¶51–52. After\nworking for an American cell phone company, he decided to start his\nown business involving the distribution and retail sale of consumer\nelectronic products in his native East Africa. Id. , at 138a,\n¶52. In pursuit of this new venture, he traveled to Sudan in late\n2009 where some of his extended family still lived. Ibid . On arrival, Mr. Fikre informed U. S. officials\nof his interest in pursuing business opportunities in the country. Ibid . Eventually, he received an invitation to the\nU. S. embassy—ostensibly for a luncheon. Id. , at\n138a–139a, ¶¶53–55. But, once there, Fikre was whisked instead to a\nsmall meeting room with two FBI agents. Id. , at 139a,\n¶¶55–56. The agents told him that the government had placed him on\nthe No Fly List, so he “could not return to the United States.” Ibid. , ¶57. The agents then questioned him “extensively\nabout the events, activities, and leadership” of the Portland\nmosque he attended. Ibid. , ¶58. They asked him to serve as\nan FBI informant and report on other members of his religious\ncommunity, offering to “take steps to remove [him] from the No Fly\nList” if he agreed. Id. , at 140a, ¶59. Mr. Fikre refused and\neventually departed. Ibid. The next day, an agent told him\nover the phone that, “ ‘[w]henever you want to go home[,] you\ncome to the embassy.’ ” Id. , at 140a–141a, ¶62. Mr.\nFikre took this to mean that he “would not be removed from the No\nFly List and he could not travel to the United States unless he\nbecame” an FBI informant. Id. , at 141a, ¶62. Several weeks later, Mr. Fikre traveled to the\nUnited Arab Emirates to advance his business plans. Id. , at\n142a, ¶68. Eventually, however, authorities there “arrested,\nimprisoned, and tortured him.” 35 F. 4th 762, 766 (CA9 2022);\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 142a–143a, Seventh Amended Complaint\n¶¶69–71. They interrogated him, too, about his Portland mosque, its\nevents, leader, and fundraising activities. Id ., at 143a,\n¶72. One interrogator told Mr. Fikre that the FBI had solicited his\ninterrogation and detention. Id ., at 147a, ¶88. After\nholding him for 106 days, authorities arranged to have Mr. Fikre\nflown to Sweden where he had a relative. Id. , at 147a, ¶86,\n148a, ¶90. He remained there until February 2015, when the Swedish\ngovernment returned him to Portland by private jet. Id. , at\n152a, ¶105. B While still in Sweden, Mr. Fikre filed this\nsuit. In his complaint, he alleged that the government had violated\nhis rights to procedural due process by failing to provide any\nmeaningful notice of his addition to the No Fly List, any\ninformation about the factual basis for his listing, and any\nappropriate way to secure redress. Id. , at 165a, ¶164.\nFurther, he claimed, the government had placed him on the list for\nconstitutionally impermissible reasons, including his race,\nnational origin, and religious beliefs. Id. , at 168a, ¶176.\nBy way of relief, he sought a declaratory judgment confirming that\nthe government had violated his rights, as well as an injunction\nprohibiting it from keeping him on the No Fly List. Id. , at\n169a–170a. Eventually, in May 2016, the government notified\nMr. Fikre that it had removed him from the No Fly List. No\nexplanation accompanied the decision. See Notice Regarding\nPlaintiff ’s Status in No. 3:13–cv–899 (D Ore.), ECF Doc. 98,\np. 1. But, in court, the government argued that its\nadministrative action rendered his lawsuit moot; even accepting all\nhis allegations as true, the government said, dismissal had to\nfollow as a matter of law. Supp. Memorandum Regarding\nPlaintiff ’s Removal From the No Fly List, ECF Doc. 104,\npp. 2–4. The district court agreed with the government’s\nassessment, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. 904 F.3d 1033 (2018).\nWhen a party seeks to moot a case based on its own voluntary\ncessation of challenged conduct, the Ninth Circuit held, it must\nshow that its “ ‘allegedly wrongful behavior’ ” cannot\n“ ‘reasonably be expected to recur.’ ” Id. , at\n1039. And, the court continued, the government’s “mere announcement\nthat Fikre was removed” from the No Fly List fell short of\nsatisfying this standard. Ibid. On remand, the government tried again. Once\nmore, it did not contest the truth of Mr. Fikre’s allegations\nconcerning his experiences. See Memorandum in Support of\nDefendants’ Motion To Dismiss in No. 3:13–cv–899 (D Ore.), ECF Doc.\n146, pp. 21–23. But, this time, the government relied on a\ndeclaration from Christopher R. Courtright, the Acting Deputy\nDirector for Operations of the Terrorist Screening Center. The\ndeclaration represented that Mr. Fikre “will not be placed on the\nNo Fly List in the future based on the currently available\ninformation.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 118a, ¶5. Persuaded by the\ngovernment’s latest motion, the district court again dismissed Mr.\nFikre’s claims as moot. 35 F. 4th, at 769. Again, however, the Ninth Circuit reversed. The\ngovernment’s declaration might mean that Mr. Fikre “will not be\nplaced on the No Fly List now based on what he did in the past.” Id. , at 772. But, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, the\ndeclaration does not disclose what conduct landed Mr. Fikre on the\nNo Fly List, and it does not ensure that he will “not be placed on\nthe List if . . . he . . . engag[es] in the\nsame or similar conduct” in the future. Ibid. As a result,\nthe court concluded, the government had still failed to meet its\nburden of establishing that its allegedly unlawful conduct cannot\n“ ‘reasonably be expected to recur.’ ” Id. , at\n770. Shortly after the Ninth Circuit issued its\ndecision, the Fourth Circuit held that a similar declaration was sufficient to moot another American citizen’s lawsuit\nchallenging his placement on the No Fly List. See Long v. Pekoske , 38 F. 4th 417, 427 (CA4 2022). To resolve this\nconflict in lower court authority, the government asked us to hear\nMr. Fikre’s case, and we agreed to do so. 600 U. S. ___\n(2023). II The Constitution grants federal courts\njurisdiction to decide “Cases” or “Controversies.” Art. III,\n§§1, 2. A court with jurisdiction has a “virtually unflagging\nobligation” to hear and resolve questions properly before it. Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United\nStates , 424 U.S.\n800 , 817 (1976). But the converse also holds true. Sometimes,\nevents in the world overtake those in the courtroom, and a\ncomplaining party manages to secure outside of litigation all the\nrelief he might have won in it. When that happens, a federal court\nmust dismiss the case as moot. Already, LLC v. Nike,\nInc. , 568 U.S.\n85 , 91 (2013). It must because federal judges are not\ncounselors or academics; they are not free to take up hypothetical\nquestions that pique a party’s curiosity or their own. The limited\nauthority vested in federal courts to decide cases and\ncontroversies means that they may no more pronounce on past actions\nthat do not have any “continuing effect” in the world than they may\nshirk decision on those that do. Spencer v. Kemna , 523 U.S.\n1 , 18 (1998). None of this implies that a defendant may\n“automatically moot a case” by the simple expedient of suspending\nits challenged conduct after it is sued. Already , 568\nU. S., at 91. Instead, our precedents hold, a defendant’s\n“ ‘voluntary cessation of a challenged practice’ ” will\nmoot a case only if the defendant can show that the practice cannot\n“ ‘reasonably be expected to recur.’ ” Friends of the\nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC),\nInc. , 528 U.S.\n167 , 189 (2000); see United States v. W. T. Grant\nCo. , 345 U.S.\n629 , 632–633 (1953). We have described this as a “formidable burden.” Friends of the Earth , 528 U. S., at 190. And the reason\nfor it is simple: “The Constitution deals with substance,” not\nstrategies. Cummings v. Missouri , 4 Wall. 277, 325\n(1867). Were the rule more forgiving, a defendant might suspend its\nchallenged conduct after being sued, win dismissal, and later pick\nup where it left off; it might even repeat “this cycle” as\nnecessary until it achieves all of its allegedly “unlawful ends.” Already , 568 U. S., at 91. A live case or controversy\ncannot be so easily disguised, and a federal court’s constitutional\nauthority cannot be so readily manipulated. To show that a case is\ntruly moot, a defendant must prove “ ‘no reasonable\nexpectation’ ” remains that it will “return to [its] old\nways.” W. T. Grant Co. , 345 U. S., at 632–633. That\nmuch holds for governmental defendants no less than for private\nones. See., e.g., West Virginia v. EPA , 597 U.S. 697,\n719 (2022); Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U.S. 449, 457, n. 1 (2017); Parents\nInvolved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No.\n1 , 551 U.S.\n701 , 719–720 (2007). The parties dispute none of these principles;\nthe only question we face concerns their application. Proceeding as\nthe courts below did, we accept Mr. Fikre’s uncontested factual\nallegations as true for purposes of this motion to dismiss. See supra , at 2, n.*. As the lower courts did, too, we accept as\ntrue the supplemental evidence the government offered: its\ndeclaration representing that Mr. Fikre “will not be placed on the\nNo Fly List in the future based on the currently available\ninformation.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 118a, ¶5. Viewed in that light, this case is not moot. To\nappreciate why, it is enough to consider one aspect of Mr. Fikre’s\ncomplaint. He contends that the government placed him on the No Fly\nList for constitutionally impermissible reasons, including his\nreligious beliefs. In support of his claim, Mr. Fikre alleges\n(among other things) that FBI agents interrogated him about a\nmosque in Portland he once attended and threatened to keep him on\nthe No Fly List unless he agreed to serve as an informant against\nhis co-religionists. Accepting these as-yet uncontested\nallegations, the government’s representation that it will not\nrelist Mr. Fikre based on “currently available information” may\nmean that his past actions are not enough to warrant his relisting.\nBut, as the court of appeals observed, none of that speaks to\nwhether the government might relist him if he does the same or\nsimilar things in the future—say, attend a particular mosque or\nrefuse renewed overtures to serve as an informant. Put simply, the\ngovernment’s sparse declaration falls short of demonstrating that\nit cannot reasonably be expected to do again in the future what it\nis alleged to have done in the past. Friends of the Earth ,\n528 U. S., at 190. If its declaration alone will not do, the\ngovernment asks us to consider two further things. First, it points\nto the fact that it removed Mr. Fikre from the No Fly List in 2016.\nThe government acknowledges that it took this action only after he\nfiled suit. But, it stresses, the parties have now sparred in court\nfor some years since his delisting. Second, the government surmises\nthat, during this period, Mr. Fikre “presumably has joined\nreligious organizations” and interacted freely with his\nco-religionists. Reply Brief 9. Together, the government submits,\nthese points make it unlikely he will face relisting in the\nfuture. That, too, is insufficient to warrant dismissal.\nA case does not automatically become moot when a defendant suspends\nits challenged conduct and then carries on litigating for some\nspecified period. Nor can a defendant’s speculation about a\nplaintiff ’s actions make up for a lack of assurance about its\nown. (For that matter, given what little we know at this stage in\nthe proceedings, Mr. Fikre may have done none of the things the\ngovernment presumes he has, perhaps wishing to but refraining for\nfear of finding himself relisted.) In all cases, it is the\ndefendant’s “burden to establish” that it cannot reasonably be\nexpected to resume its challenged conduct—whether the suit\nhappens to be new or long lingering, and whether the challenged\nconduct might recur immediately or later at some more propitious\nmoment. West Virginia , 597 U. S., at 719. Nothing the\ngovernment offers here satisfies that formidable standard. See Parents Involved , 551 U. S., at 719 (declining to\ndismiss a case as moot five years after the defendant voluntarily\nceased its challenged conduct); City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc. , 455 U.S.\n283 , 288–289 (1982) (similar). Aiming now in a different direction, the\ngovernment contends that the Ninth Circuit erred by conflating\nmootness with the merits. The government reads portions of that\ncourt’s decisions as suggesting that, to win dismissal, it had to\nadmit it lacked any lawful basis for including Mr. Fikre on the No\nFly List in the first place. For his part, Mr. Fikre disputes this\ncharacterization of the Ninth Circuit’s work; never, he says, did\nthat court require the government to repudiate its past conduct to\nprove mootness. Rather than resolve who has the better reading\nof another court’s decisions, it is enough to underline the reason\nfor our own. Yes, a party’s repudiation of its past conduct may\nsometimes help demonstrate that conduct is unlikely to recur. See, e.g., County of Los Angeles v. Davis , 440 U.S.\n625 , 632–633 (1979). But often a case will become moot even\nwhen a defendant “vehemently” insists on the propriety of “the\nconduct that precipitated the lawsuit.” Already , 568\nU. S., at 91. What matters is not whether a defendant\nrepudiates its past actions, but what repudiation can prove about\nits future conduct. It is on that consideration alone—the potential\nfor a defendant’s future conduct—that we rest our judgment. Necessarily, our judgment is a provisional one.\nJust because the government has not yet demonstrated that Mr.\nFikre’s case is moot does not mean it will never be able to do so.\nThis case comes to us in a preliminary posture, framed only by\nuncontested factual allegations and a terse declaration. As the\ncase unfolds, the complaint’s allegations will be tested rather\nthan taken as true, and different facts may emerge that may call\nfor a different conclusion. That is a possibility courts must be\nalive to in this (and any) case, for a federal court’s duty to\nensure itself of Article III jurisdiction may begin at the\ninception of a lawsuit, but it persists throughout the life of the\nproceedings. Spencer , 523 U. S., at 7. To be sure, litigating disputes that potentially\ntouch on matters of national security beyond the motion-to-dismiss\nstage can present evidentiary challenges for parties and courts\nalike. Careful attention must be paid to the handling of classified\nor privileged information. For our present purposes, however, it is\nenough to know both sides agree that “[a]dhering to traditional\nmootness principles is especially important in this\nnational-security context.” Reply Brief 18; see Brief for\nPetitioners 34; Brief for Respondent 45. And adhering to those\nprinciples here, “it is impossible to conclude” the government has\nso far “borne [its] burden” of proving that this dispute is moot. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Slater , 528 U.S.\n216 , 224 (2000) ( per curiam ). * The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit is Affirmed. Notes 1 Responding to Mr. Fikre’s\ncomplaint with a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, the\ngovernment did not contest his factual allegations, and the courts\nbelow thus assumed their truth. See Gibbs v. Buck , 307 U.S.\n66 , 72 (1939); 5C C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice\nand Procedure §1363, p. 107 (3d ed. 2004) (“The general rule”\nfor Rule 12(b)(1) motions challenging subject-matter jurisdiction\nis to take allegations “as true unless denied or controverted by\nthe movant”). We do the same.",

FIKRE certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the ninth circuit No. 22–1178. Argued January 8, 2024—Decided\nMarch 19, 2024 Respondent Yonas Fikre, a U. S. citizen\nand Sudanese emigree, brought suit alleging that the government\nplaced him on the No Fly List unlawfully. In his complaint, Mr.\nFikre alleged that he traveled from his home in Portland, Oregon to\nSudan in 2009 to pursue business opportunities there. At a visit to\nthe U. S. embassy, two FBI agents informed Mr. Fikre that he\ncould not return to the United States because the government had\nplaced him on the No Fly List. The agents questioned him\nextensively about the Portland mosque he attended, and they offered\nto take steps to remove him from the No Fly List if he agreed to\nbecome an FBI informant and to report on other members of his\nreligious community. Mr. Fikre refused. He then traveled to the\nUnited Arab Emirates, where he alleges authorities interrogated and\ndetained him for 106 days at the behest of the FBI. Unable to fly\nback to the United States, he ended up in Sweden, where he remained\nuntil February 2015. While there, he filed this suit, alleging that\nthe government had violated his rights to procedural due process by\nfailing to provide either meaningful notice of his addition to the\nNo Fly List or any appropriate way to secure redress. He further\nalleged that the government had placed him on the list for\nconstitutionally impermissible reasons related to his race,\nnational origin, and religious beliefs. Mr. Fikre sought, among\nother things, an injunction prohibiting the government from keeping\nhim on the No Fly List and a declaratory judgment confirming the\ngovernment had violated his rights. In May 2016, the government\nnotified Mr. Fikre that he had been removed from the No Fly List\nand sought dismissal of his suit in district court, arguing that\nits administrative action had rendered the case moot. The district\ncourt agreed with the government, but the Ninth Circuit reversed,\nholding that a party seeking to moot a case based on its own\nvoluntary cessation of challenged conduct must show that the\nconduct cannot “reasonably be expected to recur.” 904 F.3d 1033,\n1039. On remand, the government submitted a declaration asserting\nthat, based on the currently available information, Mr. Fikre would\nnot be placed on the No Fly List in the future, and the district\ncourt again dismissed Mr. Fikre’s claim as moot. The Ninth Circuit\nonce again reversed, holding that the government had failed to meet\nits burden because the declaration did not disclose the conduct\nthat landed Mr. Fikre on the No Fly List and did not ensure that he\nwould not be placed back on the list for engaging in the same or\nsimilar conduct in the future. 35 F. 4th 762, 770–772. Held : The government has failed to\ndemonstrate that this case is moot. A court with jurisdiction has a\n“virtually unflagging obligation” to hear and resolve questions\nproperly before it. Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States , 424 U.S.\n800 , 817 (1976). But the converse is also true as a federal\ncourt must dismiss a case that is moot. Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc. , 568 U.S.\n85 , 91 (2013). The limited authority vested in federal courts\nby Article III of the U. S. Constitution to decide cases and\ncontroversies means that federal courts may no more pronounce on\npast actions that have no “continuing effect” in the world than\nthey may neglect their obligation to hear and resolve questions\nproperly before them. Spencer v. Kemna , 523 U.S.\n1 , 18. This does not imply that a defendant may “automatically\nmoot a case” by the simple expedient of suspending its challenged\nconduct after it is sued. Instead, a defendant’s “voluntary\ncessation of a challenged practice” will moot a case only if the\ndefendant can show that the practice cannot “reasonably be expected\nto recur.” Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw\nEnvironmental Services (TOC), Inc. , 528\nU.S. 167 , 189. This standard holds for governmental defendants\nno less than for private ones. Applying these principles to the\nuncontested factual allegations here, this case is not moot. While\nthe government’s representation that it will not relist Mr. Fikre\nmay mean that his past conduct is not enough to warrant relisting,\nthat does not speak to whether the government might relist him if\nhe engages in the same or similar conduct in the future. The\ngovernment contends that because Mr. Fikre has been delisted since\n2016 and has presumably interacted freely with his co-religionists\nduring that time, it is unlikely he will face relisting in the\nfuture. This too is insufficient to warrant dismissal. A\ndefendant’s speculation about a plaintiff’s actions cannot make up\nfor a lack of assurance about its own. The burden here is on the\ndefendant to establish that it cannot reasonably be expected to\nresume its challenged conduct, see West Virginia v. EPA , 597 U.S. 697, 719, and nothing the government offers\nhere satisfies that formidable standard. The government claims the\nNinth Circuit erred by requiring it to repudiate its past conduct\nto prove mootness, but what matters is not whether a defendant\nrepudiates its past actions, but what the defendant can prove about\nits future conduct. Coming as this case does in a preliminary\nposture, the Court’s judgment is a necessarily provisional one. As\nthe complaint’s allegations are tested, different facts may emerge\nthat may call for a different result. But adhering to traditional\nmootness principles, the government has so far failed to meet its\nburden. Pp. 5–10. 35 F. 4th 762, affirmed. Gorsuch, J., delivered the opinion for a\nunanimous Court.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 22–1178 _________________ FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, et al.,\nPETITIONERS v. YONAS FIKRE on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the ninth circuit [March 19, 2024] Justice Gorsuch delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. Yonas Fikre, a U. S. citizen, brought suit\nalleging that the government placed him on the No Fly List\nunlawfully. Later, the government removed him from the list. The\nonly question we are asked to decide is whether the government’s\naction suffices to render Mr. Fikre’s claims moot. I A In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001,\nterrorist attacks, the federal government rapidly expanded its No\nFly List. By 2016, the government forbade approximately 81,000\nindividuals from flying into, out of, within, or over the United\nStates. Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae 5. Many of the details surrounding the No Fly\nList are not publicly available. Some are classified, and it\nappears no statute or publicly promulgated regulation describes the\nstandards the government employs when adding individuals to, or\nremoving them from, the list. Id. , at 6. In his complaint, Mr. Fikre challenged his\nplacement on the No Fly List. In support of his suit, he pleaded a\nnumber of facts. Those as-yet uncontested factual allegations, the\ntruth of which we do not pass upon, aver as follows:[ 1 ] When he was a child and war broke out in his\nhome country of Eritrea, Mr. Fikre and his family moved to Sudan\nbefore eventually immigrating to the United States. App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 126a, Seventh Amended Complaint ¶4; id. , at 137a,\n¶51. In time, Mr. Fikre became a U. S. citizen, and as an adult he\nlived in Portland, Oregon. Id. , at 137a–138a, ¶¶51–52. After\nworking for an American cell phone company, he decided to start his\nown business involving the distribution and retail sale of consumer\nelectronic products in his native East Africa. Id. , at 138a,\n¶52. In pursuit of this new venture, he traveled to Sudan in late\n2009 where some of his extended family still lived. Ibid . On arrival, Mr. Fikre informed U. S. officials\nof his interest in pursuing business opportunities in the country. Ibid . Eventually, he received an invitation to the\nU. S. embassy—ostensibly for a luncheon. Id. , at\n138a–139a, ¶¶53–55. But, once there, Fikre was whisked instead to a\nsmall meeting room with two FBI agents. Id. , at 139a,\n¶¶55–56. The agents told him that the government had placed him on\nthe No Fly List, so he “could not return to the United States.” Ibid. , ¶57. The agents then questioned him “extensively\nabout the events, activities, and leadership” of the Portland\nmosque he attended. Ibid. , ¶58. They asked him to serve as\nan FBI informant and report on other members of his religious\ncommunity, offering to “take steps to remove [him] from the No Fly\nList” if he agreed. Id. , at 140a, ¶59. Mr. Fikre refused and\neventually departed. Ibid. The next day, an agent told him\nover the phone that, “ ‘[w]henever you want to go home[,] you\ncome to the embassy.’ ” Id. , at 140a–141a, ¶62. Mr.\nFikre took this to mean that he “would not be removed from the No\nFly List and he could not travel to the United States unless he\nbecame” an FBI informant. Id. , at 141a, ¶62. Several weeks later, Mr. Fikre traveled to the\nUnited Arab Emirates to advance his business plans. Id. , at\n142a, ¶68. Eventually, however, authorities there “arrested,\nimprisoned, and tortured him.” 35 F. 4th 762, 766 (CA9 2022);\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 142a–143a, Seventh Amended Complaint\n¶¶69–71. They interrogated him, too, about his Portland mosque, its\nevents, leader, and fundraising activities. Id ., at 143a,\n¶72. One interrogator told Mr. Fikre that the FBI had solicited his\ninterrogation and detention. Id ., at 147a, ¶88. After\nholding him for 106 days, authorities arranged to have Mr. Fikre\nflown to Sweden where he had a relative. Id. , at 147a, ¶86,\n148a, ¶90. He remained there until February 2015, when the Swedish\ngovernment returned him to Portland by private jet. Id. , at\n152a, ¶105. B While still in Sweden, Mr. Fikre filed this\nsuit. In his complaint, he alleged that the government had violated\nhis rights to procedural due process by failing to provide any\nmeaningful notice of his addition to the No Fly List, any\ninformation about the factual basis for his listing, and any\nappropriate way to secure redress. Id. , at 165a, ¶164.\nFurther, he claimed, the government had placed him on the list for\nconstitutionally impermissible reasons, including his race,\nnational origin, and religious beliefs. Id. , at 168a, ¶176.\nBy way of relief, he sought a declaratory judgment confirming that\nthe government had violated his rights, as well as an injunction\nprohibiting it from keeping him on the No Fly List. Id. , at\n169a–170a. Eventually, in May 2016, the government notified\nMr. Fikre that it had removed him from the No Fly List. No\nexplanation accompanied the decision. See Notice Regarding\nPlaintiff ’s Status in No. 3:13–cv–899 (D Ore.), ECF Doc. 98,\np. 1. But, in court, the government argued that its\nadministrative action rendered his lawsuit moot; even accepting all\nhis allegations as true, the government said, dismissal had to\nfollow as a matter of law. Supp. Memorandum Regarding\nPlaintiff ’s Removal From the No Fly List, ECF Doc. 104,\npp. 2–4. The district court agreed with the government’s\nassessment, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. 904 F.3d 1033 (2018).\nWhen a party seeks to moot a case based on its own voluntary\ncessation of challenged conduct, the Ninth Circuit held, it must\nshow that its “ ‘allegedly wrongful behavior’ ” cannot\n“ ‘reasonably be expected to recur.’ ” Id. , at\n1039. And, the court continued, the government’s “mere announcement\nthat Fikre was removed” from the No Fly List fell short of\nsatisfying this standard. Ibid. On remand, the government tried again. Once\nmore, it did not contest the truth of Mr. Fikre’s allegations\nconcerning his experiences. See Memorandum in Support of\nDefendants’ Motion To Dismiss in No. 3:13–cv–899 (D Ore.), ECF Doc.\n146, pp. 21–23. But, this time, the government relied on a\ndeclaration from Christopher R. Courtright, the Acting Deputy\nDirector for Operations of the Terrorist Screening Center. The\ndeclaration represented that Mr. Fikre “will not be placed on the\nNo Fly List in the future based on the currently available\ninformation.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 118a, ¶5. Persuaded by the\ngovernment’s latest motion, the district court again dismissed Mr.\nFikre’s claims as moot. 35 F. 4th, at 769. Again, however, the Ninth Circuit reversed. The\ngovernment’s declaration might mean that Mr. Fikre “will not be\nplaced on the No Fly List now based on what he did in the past.” Id. , at 772. But, the Ninth Circuit reasoned, the\ndeclaration does not disclose what conduct landed Mr. Fikre on the\nNo Fly List, and it does not ensure that he will “not be placed on\nthe List if . . . he . . . engag[es] in the\nsame or similar conduct” in the future. Ibid. As a result,\nthe court concluded, the government had still failed to meet its\nburden of establishing that its allegedly unlawful conduct cannot\n“ ‘reasonably be expected to recur.’ ” Id. , at\n770. Shortly after the Ninth Circuit issued its\ndecision, the Fourth Circuit held that a similar declaration was sufficient to moot another American citizen’s lawsuit\nchallenging his placement on the No Fly List. See Long v. Pekoske , 38 F. 4th 417, 427 (CA4 2022). To resolve this\nconflict in lower court authority, the government asked us to hear\nMr. Fikre’s case, and we agreed to do so. 600 U. S. ___\n(2023). II The Constitution grants federal courts\njurisdiction to decide “Cases” or “Controversies.” Art. III,\n§§1, 2. A court with jurisdiction has a “virtually unflagging\nobligation” to hear and resolve questions properly before it. Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United\nStates , 424 U.S.\n800 , 817 (1976). But the converse also holds true. Sometimes,\nevents in the world overtake those in the courtroom, and a\ncomplaining party manages to secure outside of litigation all the\nrelief he might have won in it. When that happens, a federal court\nmust dismiss the case as moot. Already, LLC v. Nike,\nInc. , 568 U.S.\n85 , 91 (2013). It must because federal judges are not\ncounselors or academics; they are not free to take up hypothetical\nquestions that pique a party’s curiosity or their own. The limited\nauthority vested in federal courts to decide cases and\ncontroversies means that they may no more pronounce on past actions\nthat do not have any “continuing effect” in the world than they may\nshirk decision on those that do. Spencer v. Kemna , 523 U.S.\n1 , 18 (1998). None of this implies that a defendant may\n“automatically moot a case” by the simple expedient of suspending\nits challenged conduct after it is sued. Already , 568\nU. S., at 91. Instead, our precedents hold, a defendant’s\n“ ‘voluntary cessation of a challenged practice’ ” will\nmoot a case only if the defendant can show that the practice cannot\n“ ‘reasonably be expected to recur.’ ” Friends of the\nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC),\nInc. , 528 U.S.\n167 , 189 (2000); see United States v. W. T. Grant\nCo. , 345 U.S.\n629 , 632–633 (1953). We have described this as a “formidable burden.” Friends of the Earth , 528 U. S., at 190. And the reason\nfor it is simple: “The Constitution deals with substance,” not\nstrategies. Cummings v. Missouri , 4 Wall. 277, 325\n(1867). Were the rule more forgiving, a defendant might suspend its\nchallenged conduct after being sued, win dismissal, and later pick\nup where it left off; it might even repeat “this cycle” as\nnecessary until it achieves all of its allegedly “unlawful ends.” Already , 568 U. S., at 91. A live case or controversy\ncannot be so easily disguised, and a federal court’s constitutional\nauthority cannot be so readily manipulated. To show that a case is\ntruly moot, a defendant must prove “ ‘no reasonable\nexpectation’ ” remains that it will “return to [its] old\nways.” W. T. Grant Co. , 345 U. S., at 632–633. That\nmuch holds for governmental defendants no less than for private\nones. See., e.g., West Virginia v. EPA , 597 U.S. 697,\n719 (2022); Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U.S. 449, 457, n. 1 (2017); Parents\nInvolved in Community Schools v. Seattle School Dist. No.\n1 , 551 U.S.\n701 , 719–720 (2007). The parties dispute none of these principles;\nthe only question we face concerns their application. Proceeding as\nthe courts below did, we accept Mr. Fikre’s uncontested factual\nallegations as true for purposes of this motion to dismiss. See supra , at 2, n.*. As the lower courts did, too, we accept as\ntrue the supplemental evidence the government offered: its\ndeclaration representing that Mr. Fikre “will not be placed on the\nNo Fly List in the future based on the currently available\ninformation.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 118a, ¶5. Viewed in that light, this case is not moot. To\nappreciate why, it is enough to consider one aspect of Mr. Fikre’s\ncomplaint. He contends that the government placed him on the No Fly\nList for constitutionally impermissible reasons, including his\nreligious beliefs. In support of his claim, Mr. Fikre alleges\n(among other things) that FBI agents interrogated him about a\nmosque in Portland he once attended and threatened to keep him on\nthe No Fly List unless he agreed to serve as an informant against\nhis co-religionists. Accepting these as-yet uncontested\nallegations, the government’s representation that it will not\nrelist Mr. Fikre based on “currently available information” may\nmean that his past actions are not enough to warrant his relisting.\nBut, as the court of appeals observed, none of that speaks to\nwhether the government might relist him if he does the same or\nsimilar things in the future—say, attend a particular mosque or\nrefuse renewed overtures to serve as an informant. Put simply, the\ngovernment’s sparse declaration falls short of demonstrating that\nit cannot reasonably be expected to do again in the future what it\nis alleged to have done in the past. Friends of the Earth ,\n528 U. S., at 190. If its declaration alone will not do, the\ngovernment asks us to consider two further things. First, it points\nto the fact that it removed Mr. Fikre from the No Fly List in 2016.\nThe government acknowledges that it took this action only after he\nfiled suit. But, it stresses, the parties have now sparred in court\nfor some years since his delisting. Second, the government surmises\nthat, during this period, Mr. Fikre “presumably has joined\nreligious organizations” and interacted freely with his\nco-religionists. Reply Brief 9. Together, the government submits,\nthese points make it unlikely he will face relisting in the\nfuture. That, too, is insufficient to warrant dismissal.\nA case does not automatically become moot when a defendant suspends\nits challenged conduct and then carries on litigating for some\nspecified period. Nor can a defendant’s speculation about a\nplaintiff ’s actions make up for a lack of assurance about its\nown. (For that matter, given what little we know at this stage in\nthe proceedings, Mr. Fikre may have done none of the things the\ngovernment presumes he has, perhaps wishing to but refraining for\nfear of finding himself relisted.) In all cases, it is the\ndefendant’s “burden to establish” that it cannot reasonably be\nexpected to resume its challenged conduct—whether the suit\nhappens to be new or long lingering, and whether the challenged\nconduct might recur immediately or later at some more propitious\nmoment. West Virginia , 597 U. S., at 719. Nothing the\ngovernment offers here satisfies that formidable standard. See Parents Involved , 551 U. S., at 719 (declining to\ndismiss a case as moot five years after the defendant voluntarily\nceased its challenged conduct); City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, Inc. , 455 U.S.\n283 , 288–289 (1982) (similar). Aiming now in a different direction, the\ngovernment contends that the Ninth Circuit erred by conflating\nmootness with the merits. The government reads portions of that\ncourt’s decisions as suggesting that, to win dismissal, it had to\nadmit it lacked any lawful basis for including Mr. Fikre on the No\nFly List in the first place. For his part, Mr. Fikre disputes this\ncharacterization of the Ninth Circuit’s work; never, he says, did\nthat court require the government to repudiate its past conduct to\nprove mootness. Rather than resolve who has the better reading\nof another court’s decisions, it is enough to underline the reason\nfor our own. Yes, a party’s repudiation of its past conduct may\nsometimes help demonstrate that conduct is unlikely to recur. See, e.g., County of Los Angeles v. Davis , 440 U.S.\n625 , 632–633 (1979). But often a case will become moot even\nwhen a defendant “vehemently” insists on the propriety of “the\nconduct that precipitated the lawsuit.” Already , 568\nU. S., at 91. What matters is not whether a defendant\nrepudiates its past actions, but what repudiation can prove about\nits future conduct. It is on that consideration alone—the potential\nfor a defendant’s future conduct—that we rest our judgment. Necessarily, our judgment is a provisional one.\nJust because the government has not yet demonstrated that Mr.\nFikre’s case is moot does not mean it will never be able to do so.\nThis case comes to us in a preliminary posture, framed only by\nuncontested factual allegations and a terse declaration. As the\ncase unfolds, the complaint’s allegations will be tested rather\nthan taken as true, and different facts may emerge that may call\nfor a different conclusion. That is a possibility courts must be\nalive to in this (and any) case, for a federal court’s duty to\nensure itself of Article III jurisdiction may begin at the\ninception of a lawsuit, but it persists throughout the life of the\nproceedings. Spencer , 523 U. S., at 7. To be sure, litigating disputes that potentially\ntouch on matters of national security beyond the motion-to-dismiss\nstage can present evidentiary challenges for parties and courts\nalike. Careful attention must be paid to the handling of classified\nor privileged information. For our present purposes, however, it is\nenough to know both sides agree that “[a]dhering to traditional\nmootness principles is especially important in this\nnational-security context.” Reply Brief 18; see Brief for\nPetitioners 34; Brief for Respondent 45. And adhering to those\nprinciples here, “it is impossible to conclude” the government has\nso far “borne [its] burden” of proving that this dispute is moot. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Slater , 528 U.S.\n216 , 224 (2000) ( per curiam ). * The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit is Affirmed. Notes 1 Responding to Mr. Fikre’s\ncomplaint with a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, the\ngovernment did not contest his factual allegations, and the courts\nbelow thus assumed their truth. See Gibbs v. Buck , 307 U.S.\n66 , 72 (1939); 5C C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice\nand Procedure §1363, p. 107 (3d ed. 2004) (“The general rule”\nfor Rule 12(b)(1) motions challenging subject-matter jurisdiction\nis to take allegations “as true unless denied or controverted by\nthe movant”). We do the same.",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus MAHMOUD et al. v . TAYLOR et al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit No. 24–297. Argued April 22, 2025—Decided June\n27, 2025 During the 2022–2023 school year, the\nMontgomery County Board of Education (Board) introduced a variety\nof “LGBTQ+-inclusive” texts into the public school curriculum.\nThose texts included five “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks approved\nfor students in kindergarten through fifth grade, which have story\nlines focused on sexuality and gender. When parents in Montgomery\nCounty sought to have their children excused from instruction\ninvolving those books, the Board initially compromised with the\nparents by notifying them when the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks\nwould be taught and permitting their children to be excused from\nthe instruction. That compromise was consistent with the Board’s\n“Guidelines for Respecting Religious Diversity,” which professed a\ncommitment to making “reasonable accommodations” for the religious\n“beliefs and practices” of students. Less than a year after the\nBoard introduced the books, however, it rescinded the parental opt\nout policy. Among other things, the Board said that it “could not\naccommodate the growing number of opt out requests without causing\nsignificant disruptions to the classroom environment.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 607a. The petitioners here are a group of individual\nparents and an unincorporated association of other interested\nparties. The individual parents come from diverse religious\nbackgrounds and hold sincere views on sexuality and gender which\nthey wish to pass on to their children. Faced with the Board’s\ndecision to rescind opt outs, petitioners filed a lawsuit in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland. Among\nother things, they asserted that the Board’s no-opt-out policy\ninfringed on parents’ right to the free exercise of their religion.\nSee Kennedy v. Bremerton School Dist ., 597 U.S. 507,\n524. They relied heavily on Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U.S.\n205 , in which the Court recognized that parents have a right\n“to direct the religious upbringing of their children” and that\nthis right can be infringed by laws that pose “a very real threat\nof undermining” the religious beliefs and practices that parents\nwish to instill in their children. Id ., at 218, 233.\nPetitioners sought a preliminary and permanent injunction\n“prohibiting the School Board from forcing [their] children and\nother students—over the objection of their parents—to read, listen\nto, or discuss” the storybooks. App. to Pet. for Cert. 206a. The\nDistrict Court denied relief, and a divided panel of the Fourth\nCircuit affirmed. Held : Parents challenging the\nBoard’s introduction of the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks, along\nwith its decision to withhold opt outs, are entitled to a\npreliminary injunction. Pp. 16–41. (a) The parents assert that the Board’s\nintroduction of the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks—combined with its\ndecision to withhold notice and opt outs—unconstitutionally burdens\ntheir religious exercise. At this stage, the parents seek a\npreliminary injunction that would permit them to have their\nchildren excused from instruction related to the storybooks while\nthis lawsuit proceeds. To obtain that form of preliminary relief,\nthe parents must show that: they are likely to succeed on the\nmerits; they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence\nof preliminary relief; the balance of equities tips in their favor;\nand an injunction would be in the public interest. Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. , 555 U.S.\n7 , 20. The parents have made such a showing. Pp. 16–17. (b) The parents are likely to succeed on\ntheir claim that the Board’s policies unconstitutionally burden\ntheir religious exercise. The Court has “long recognized the rights\nof parents to direct ‘the religious upbringing’ of their children.” Espinoza v. Montana Dept. of Revenue , 591 U.S. 464,\n486 (quoting Yoder , 406 U. S., at 213–214). Those\nrights are violated by government policies that “substantially\ninterfer[e] with the religious development” of children. Yoder , 406 U. S., at 218. Pp. 17–27. (1) For many people of faith, there are\nfew religious acts more important than the religious education of\ntheir children. See Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru , 591 U.S. 732, 754. And the practice of\neducating one’s children in one’s religious beliefs, like all\nreligious acts and practices, receives a generous measure of\nconstitutional protection. The Constitution protects, for example,\na parent’s decision to send his or her child to a private religious\nschool instead of a public school. Pierce v. Society of\nSisters , 268 U.S.\n510 , 532–535. And the Court has recognized limits on the\ngovernment’s ability to interfere with a student’s religious\nupbringing in a public school setting. In West Virginia Bd. of\nEd. v. Barnette , 319 U.S.\n624 , for example, the Court held that a policy requiring public\nschool students to salute the flag could not be enforced against\nJehovah’s Witnesses—who consider the flag a “graven\nimage”—consistent with the First Amendment. Barnette involved an egregious kind of\ndirect coercion: a requirement that students make an affirmation\ncontrary to their parents’ religious beliefs. In Yoder , the\nCourt held that the Free Exercise Clause also protects against\npolicies that impose more subtle forms of interference with the\nreligious upbringing of children. There, the Court considered a\ncompulsory-education law that would place Amish children into “an\nenvironment hostile to Amish beliefs,” where they would face\n“pressure to conform” to contrary viewpoints and lifestyles. 406\nU. S., at 211. The Court concluded that such a law\n“substantially interfer[ed] with the religious development of the\nAmish child” and therefore “carrie[d] with it precisely the kind of\nobjective danger to the free exercise of religion that the First\nAmendment was designed to prevent.” Id ., at 218. Pp.\n18–21. (2) The Board’s introduction of the\n“LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks, combined with its decision to\nwithhold notice to parents and to forbid opt outs, substantially\ninterferes with the religious development of petitioners’ children\nand imposes the kind of burden on religious exercise that Yoder found unacceptable. The books are unmistakably\nnormative. They are designed to present certain values and beliefs\nas things to be celebrated, and certain contrary values and beliefs\nas things to be rejected. Take, for example, the message sent by the\nbooks concerning same-sex marriage. Many Americans “advocate with\nutmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex\nmarriage should not be condoned.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S.\n644 , 679. That group includes each of the parents in this case.\nThe storybooks, however, are designed to present the opposite\nviewpoint to young, impressionable children who are likely to\naccept without question any moral messages conveyed by their\nteacher’s instruction. The storybooks present same-sex weddings as\noccasions for great celebration and suggest that the only rubric\nfor determining whether a marriage is acceptable is whether the\nindividuals concerned “love each other.” The storybooks similarly convey a normative\nmessage on the subjects of sex and gender. Many Americans, like the\nparents in this case, believe that biological sex reflects divine\ncreation, that sex and gender are inseparable, and that children\nshould be encouraged to accept their sex and to live accordingly.\nThe storybooks, however, suggest that it is hurtful, and perhaps\neven hateful, to hold the view that gender is inextricably bound\nwith biological sex. Like the compulsory high school education\nconsidered in Yoder , these books impose upon children a set\nof values and beliefs that are “hostile” to their parents’\nreligious beliefs. Id ., at 211. And the books exert upon\nchildren a psychological “pressure to conform” to their specific\nviewpoints. Ibid. The books therefore present the same kind\nof “objective danger to the free exercise of religion” that the\nCourt identified in Yoder . Id ., at 218. Pp.\n21–27. (c) None of the counterarguments raised\nby the Board, the courts below, or the Board’s amici give us\nany reason to doubt the existence of a burden on religious exercise\nhere. Pp. 27–35. (1) The Court does not accept the Board’s\ncharacterizations of the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” instruction as mere\n“exposure to objectionable ideas” or as lessons in “mutual\nrespect.” The storybooks unmistakably convey a particular viewpoint\nabout same-sex marriage and gender. And the Board has specifically\nencouraged teachers to reinforce this viewpoint and to reprimand\nany children who disagree. That goes beyond mere “exposure.”\nRegardless, the question in cases of this kind is whether the\neducational requirement or curriculum at issue would “substantially\ninterfer[e] with the religious development” of the child, or pose\n“a very real threat of undermining” the religious beliefs and\npractices the parent wishes to instill in the child. Yoder ,\n406 U. S., at 218. Whether or not a requirement or curriculum could\nbe characterized as “exposure” is not the touchstone for\ndetermining whether that line is crossed. Pp. 27–28. (2) The Board’s reliance on the Court’s\ndecisions in Bowen v. Roy , 476\nU.S. 693 , and Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery\nProtective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , is likewise unpersuasive. In those cases, the Court held\nthat “[t]he Free Exercise Clause simply cannot be understood to\nrequire the Government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways\nthat comport with the religious beliefs of particular citizens,” Bowen , 476 U. S., at 699, even when the conduct of such\ninternal affairs might result in “incidental interference with an\nindividual’s spiritual activities,” Lyng , 485 U. S., at\n450. That principle has no application here. The government’s\noperation of public schools is not a matter of “internal affairs”\nakin to the administration of Social Security or the selection of\n“filing cabinets.” Bowen , 476 U. S., at 700. It\nimplicates direct, coercive interactions between the State and its\nyoung residents. Pp. 28–29. (3) The courts below erred by dismissing\nthis Court’s decision in Yoder. The Court has never confined Yoder to its facts, and there is no reason to conclude that\nthe decision is “ sui generis ” or “tailored to [its] specific\nevidence,” as the courts below reasoned. While the Court noted in Yoder that the Amish made a showing “that probably few other\nreligious groups or sects could make,” that language must be read\nin the context of the specific claims raised by the Amish\nrespondents, i.e. , the right to withdraw their children from\nall conventional schooling after a certain age. 406 U. S., at\n235–236. Contrary to the suggestions of the courts below, Yoder embodies a robust principle of general applicability.\nPp. 29–31. (4) The Fourth Circuit’s view that the\nrecord in this case is too “threadbare” to demonstrate a burden on\nreligious exercise is also unconvincing. 102 F. 4th 191, 209. That\ncourt faulted the parents for failing to make specific allegations\ndescribing how the books “are actually being used in classrooms.” Id ., at 213. But when a deprivation of First Amendment\nrights is at stake, a plaintiff need not wait for the damage to\noccur before filing suit. Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus , 573 U.S.\n149 , 158. To evaluate the plaintiffs’ claims, the Court need\nonly decide whether—if teachers act according to the clear and\nundisputed instructions of the Board—a burden on religious exercise\nwill occur. Pp. 31–32. (5) It is no answer that parents remain\nfree to place their children in private school or to educate them\nat home. Public education is a public benefit, and the government\ncannot “condition” its “availability” on parents’ willingness to\naccept a burden on their religious exercise. Trinity Lutheran\nChurch of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U.S. 449, 462.\nMoreover, given that education is compulsory in Maryland, the\nparents are not being asked simply to forgo a public benefit. They\nhave an obligation—enforceable by fine or imprisonment—to send\ntheir children to public school unless they find an adequate\nsubstitute they can afford. §§7–301(a)(3), (e). Nor is it of any comfort to suggest that\nparents can educate their children at home after school. The\nparents in Barnette and Yoder were similarly capable\nof teaching their religious values “at home,” but that made no\ndifference in the First Amendment analysis in those cases. It is\nsimilarly unconvincing to suggest that the parents could have\nchallenged the educational requirements via the democratic process.\nThe parents tried and failed to obtain legislative change, and had\nevery right to resort to judicial review to protect their rights.\nPp. 32–35. (d) Having concluded that the Board’s\npolicy burdens the parents’ right to the free exercise of religion,\nthe Court turns to the question whether that burden is\nconstitutionally permitted. Pp. 35–40. (1) In most circumstances, the government\nis generally free to place incidental burdens on religious exercise\nso long as it does so pursuant to a neutral policy that is\ngenerally applicable. Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources\nof Ore. v. Smith , 494 U.S.\n872 , 878–879. But when a law imposes a burden of the same\ncharacter as that in Yoder , as does the challenged Board\npolicy here, strict scrutiny is appropriate regardless of whether\nthe law is neutral or generally applicable. Smith , 494\nU. S., at 881. Pp. 35–37. (2) To survive strict scrutiny, a\ngovernment must demonstrate that its policy “advances ‘interests of\nthe highest order’ and is narrowly tailored to achieve those\ninterests.” Fulton v. Philadelphia , 593 U.S. 522, 541\n(quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc . v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546). The Board asserts that its curriculum and no-opt-out\npolicy serve its compelling interest in maintaining a school\nenvironment that is safe and conducive to learning for all\nstudents. As a general matter, schools have a “compelling interest\nin having an undisrupted school session conducive to the students’\nlearning.” Grayned v. City of Rockford , 408 U.S.\n104 , 119. But the Board’s conduct in continuing to permit opt\nouts in a variety of other circumstances undermines its assertion\nthat its no-opt-out policy is necessary to serve that interest. Pp.\n37–40. (e) Without an injunction, the parents\nwill continue to suffer an unconstitutional burden on their\nreligious exercise, and such a burden unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury. See Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 592 U.S. 14, 19 ( per curiam ). And an\ninjunction here would be both equitable and in the public interest.\nThus, the petitioners have shown that they are entitled to a\npreliminary injunction. Specifically, until all appellate review in\nthis case is completed, the Board should be ordered to notify the\npetitioners in advance whenever one of the books in question or any\nother similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to\nhave their children excused from that instruction. Pp. 40–41. 102 F. 4th 191, reversed and remanded. Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court,\nin which Roberts, C. J., and Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and\nBarrett, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 24–297 _________________ Tamer Mahmoud, et al., PETITIONERS v. Thomas W. Taylor, et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fourth circuit [June 27, 2025] Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. The Board of Education of Montgomery County,\nMaryland (Board), has introduced a variety of “LGBTQ+-inclusive”\nstorybooks into the elementary school curriculum. These books—and\nassociated educational instructions provided to teachers—are\ndesigned to “disrupt” children’s thinking about sexuality and\ngender. The Board has told parents that it will not give them\nnotice when the books are going to be used and that their\nchildren’s attendance during those periods is mandatory. A group of\nparents from diverse religious backgrounds sued to enjoin those\npolicies. They assert that the new curriculum, combined with the\nBoard’s decision to deny opt outs, impermissibly burdens their\nreligious exercise. Today, we hold that the parents have shown that\nthey are entitled to a preliminary injunction. A government burdens\nthe religious exercise of parents when it requires them to submit\ntheir children to instruction that poses “a very real threat of\nundermining” the religious beliefs and practices that the parents\nwish to instill. Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406\nU.S. 205 , 218 (1972). And a government cannot condition the\nbenefit of free public education on parents’ acceptance of such\ninstruction. Based on these principles, we conclude that the\nparents are likely to succeed in their challenge to the Board’s\npolicies. I A 1 With just over one million residents,\nMontgomery County is Maryland’s most populous county. According to\na recent survey, it is also the “most religiously diverse county”\nin the Nation.[ 1 ] In addition\nto hosting a diverse mix of Christian denominations, the county\nranks in the top five in the Nation in per-capita population of\nJews, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists.[ 2 ] The county’s religious diversity is accompanied by\nstrong cultural diversity as well. The county is home to several\nnotable ethnic communities. For example, the Ethiopian community in\nSilver Spring is one of the largest in the country.[ 3 ] And according to one survey, “[o]nly 56.8%\nof county residents speak English at home.” N. 1, supra . Most Montgomery County residents with school age\nchildren, by choice or necessity, send them to public school. As a\ngeneral matter, Maryland law requires that resident children ages 5\nto 18 “attend a public school regularly during the entire school\nyear.” Md. Educ. Code Ann. §7–301(a–1)(1) (2025). As an exception\nto this general rule, the State permits parents to send their\nchildren to private school or to educate them at home if certain\nrequirements can be met. §7–301(a)(3). Parents who cause their\nchildren to be absent unlawfully from school can face fines,\nmandatory community service, and even imprisonment. §7–301(e). Public education in Montgomery County is\nprovided by Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS), one of the\nlargest school districts in the Nation. In the 2022–2023 school\nyear, MCPS enrolled 160,554 students in its 210 schools and had an\noperating budget of nearly $3 billion. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n597a–598a; MCPS, FY2024 Operating Budget, p. vi–1 (2023). The\ndistrict is overseen and managed by the Montgomery County Board of\nEducation, a policymaking body consisting of seven elected county\nresidents and one student. See Md. Educ. Code Ann. §3–901(b). In recognition of the county’s religious\ndiversity, the Board’s “Guidelines for Respecting Religious\nDiversity” profess a commitment to making “reasonable\naccommodations” for the religious “beliefs and practices” of MCPS\nstudents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 210a, 212a.[ 4 ] These accommodations take various forms. For\nexample, according to one MCPS official, the Board “advises\nprincipals that schools should avoid scheduling tests or other\nmajor events on dozens of . . . ‘days of commemoration,’\nduring which MCPS expects that many students may be absent\n. . . or engaged in religious or cultural observances.” Id ., at 602a. This case, however, arises from the Board’s\nabject refusal to heed widespread and impassioned pleas for\naccommodation. In the years leading up to 2022, the Board\napparently “determined that the books used in its existing [English\n& Language Arts] curriculum were not representative of many\nstudents and families in Montgomery County because they did not\ninclude LGBTQ characters.” Id ., at 603a. The Board therefore\ndecided to introduce into the curriculum what it described as\n“ ‘LGBTQ+-inclusive texts.’ ”[ 5 ] Id ., at 174a. As one email sent by MCPS\nprincipals reflects, the Board selected the books according to a\n“Critical Selection Repertoire” that required selectors to review\npotential texts and ask questions such as: “Is heteronormativity\nreinforced or disrupted?”; “Is cisnormativity reinforced or\ndisrupted?”; and “Are power hierarchies that uphold the dominant\nculture reinforced or disrupted?” Id ., at 622a. In accordance with this “[r]epertoire” and other\ncriteria, the Board eventually selected 13 “LGBTQ+-inclusive” texts\nfor use in the English and Language Arts curriculum from pre-K\nthrough 12th grade. Id ., at 603a–604a, 622a. At issue in\nthis lawsuit are the five “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks that are\napproved for students in Kindergarten through fifth grade—in other\nwords, for children who are generally between 5 and 11 years\nold.[ 6 ] A few short descriptions will serve to\nillustrate the general tenor of the storybooks. Intersection Allies\ntells the stories of several children from different backgrounds,\nincluding Kate, who is apparently a transgender child. One page\nshows Kate in a sex-neutral or sex-ambiguous bathroom, and Kate\nproclaims: “My friends defend my choices and place. A bathroom,\nlike all rooms, should be a safe space.” Id ., at 323a.\nIntersection Allies includes a “Page-By-Page Book Discussion Guide”\nthat asserts: “When we are born, our gender is often decided for us\nbased on our sex . . . . But at any point in our\nlives, we can choose to identify with one gender, multiple genders,\nor neither gender.” Id ., at 349a–350a. The discussion guide\nexplains that “Kate prefers the pronouns they/their/them” and asks\n“ What pronouns fit you best? ” Id ., at 350a (boldface\nin original). Prince & Knight tells the story of a\ncoming-of-age prince whose parents wish to match him with “a kind\nand worthy bride.” Id ., at 397a. After meeting with “many\nladies,” the prince tells his parents that he is “ ‘looking\nfor something different in a partner by [his] side.’ ” Id ., at 398a, 400a. Later in the book, the prince falls into\nthe “embrace” of a knight after the two finish battling a fearsome\ndragon. Id ., at 415a. After the knight takes off his helmet,\nthe prince and knight “gaz[e] into each other’s eyes, [and] their\nhearts beg[in] to race.” Id ., at 418a–419a. The whole\nkingdom later applauds “on the two men’s wedding day.” Id .,\nat 424a. Love Violet follows a young girl named Violet\nwho has a crush on her female classmate, Mira. Mira makes Violet’s\n“heart skip” and “thunde[r] like a hundred galloping horses.” Id ., at 431a, 436a. Although Violet is initially too afraid\nto interact with Mira, the two end up exchanging gifts on\nValentine’s Day. Afterwards, the two girls are seen holding hands\nand “galloping over snowy drifts to see what they might find.\nTogether.” Id ., at 446a. Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named\nPenelope tells the story of Penelope, a child who is initially\ntreated as a girl. The story is told from the perspective of\nPenelope, who at one point says “If they’d all stop and listen, I’d\ntell them about me. Inside I’m a boy.” Id ., at 454a. When\nPenelope’s mother later assures her that “ ‘If you feel like a\nboy, that’s okay,’ ” Penelope responds: “ ‘No, Mama, I\ndon’t feel like a boy. I AM a boy.’ ” Id ., at\n458a. Penelope tells her mother: “ ‘I love you, Mama, but I don’t want\nto be you. I want to be Papa. I don’t want tomorrow to come\nbecause tomorrow I’ll look like you. Please help me, Mama. Help me\nto be a boy.’ ” Id. , at 459a. Penelope’s mother then agrees that she is a boy,\nand Penelope says: “For the first time, my insides don’t feel like\nfire. They feel like warm, golden love.” Id ., at 462a.\nLater, after the family starts treating Penelope as a boy,\nPenelope’s brother complains that “ ‘You can’t become a\nboy. You have to be born one.’ ” Id ., at 465a. This\ncomment draws a rebuke from Penelope’s mother: “ ‘Not\neverything needs to make sense. This is about\nlove .’ ” Ibid . Finally, Uncle Bobby’s Wedding tells the story\nof a young girl named Chloe who is informed that her favorite\nuncle, Bobby, will be getting married to his boyfriend, Jamie. When\nBobby and Jamie announce their engagement, everyone is jubilant\n“except . . . Chloe.” Id ., at 287a. Chloe says\nthat she does not “ ‘understand’ ” why her uncle is\ngetting married, but her mother responds by explaining:\n“ ‘When grown-up people love each other that much, sometimes\nthey get married.’ ” Id ., at 288a. The Board suggested “that teachers incorporate\nthe new texts into the curriculum in the same way that other books\nare used, namely, to put them on a shelf for students to find on\ntheir own; to recommend a book to a student who would enjoy it; to\noffer the books as an option for literature circles, book clubs, or\npaired reading groups; or to use them as a read aloud.” Id .,\nat 604a–605a. And “[a]s with all curriculum resources,” the Board\nvoiced its “expectation that teachers use the LGBTQ-Inclusive Books\nas part of instruction.” Id ., at 605a. An MCPS official has\nmade clear that “[t]eachers cannot . . . elect not to use\nthe LGBTQ-Inclusive Books at all.” Ibid. The Board also contemplated that instruction\ninvolving the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks would include classroom\ndiscussion. See id ., at 642a (Board’s lawyer: “there will be\ndiscussion that ensues. In fact, I think everyone would hope that\ndiscussion ensues”). In anticipation of such discussion, the Board\nhosted a “professional development workshop” in the summer of 2022,\nwhere it provided teachers with a guidance document suggesting how\nthey might respond to student inquiries regarding the themes\npresented in the books. Id ., at 273a–276a, 604a, 628a–635a.\nFor example, if a student asserts that two men cannot get married,\nthe guidance document encouraged teachers to respond by saying:\n“When people are adults they can get married. Two men who love each\nother can decide they want to get married.” Id ., at 628a. If\na student claims that a character “can’t be a boy if he was born a\ngirl,” teachers were encouraged to respond: “That comment is\nhurtful.” Id ., at 630a. And if a student asks “[w]hat’s\ntransgender?”, it was recommended that teachers explain: “When\nwe’re born, people make a guess about our gender and label us ‘boy’\nor ‘girl’ based on our body parts. Sometimes they’re right and\nsometimes they’re wrong.” Ibid . The guidance document\nencouraged teachers to “[d]isrupt the either/or thinking” of their\nstudents. Id ., at 629a, 633a. At the same workshop, the Board also provided\nteachers with a guidance document that suggested particular\nresponses to inquiries by parents. For example, if a parent were to\nask whether the school was attempting to teach a child to “reject”\nthe values taught at home, teachers were encouraged to respond that\n“[t]eaching about LGBTQ+ is not about making students think a\ncertain way; it is to show that there is no one ‘right’ or ‘normal’\nway to be.” Id ., at 638a. The guidance also urged teachers\nto assure parents that there would not be “explicit instruction”\nabout gender and sexual identity, but that “there may be a need to\ndefine words that are new and unfamiliar to students,” and that\n“questions and conversations might organically happen.” Id .,\nat 640a. If parents were not comforted by that information,\nteachers could tell them that “[p]arents always have the choice to\nkeep their student(s) home while using these texts; however, it\nwill not be an excused absence.” Ibid. 2 The Board officially launched the\n“LGBTQ+-inclusive” texts into MCPS schools in the 2022–2023 school\nyear. Shortly thereafter, parents “began contacting individual\nteachers, principals, or MCPS staff ” about the storybooks and\nasking that their children be excused from classroom instruction\nrelated to them. Id ., at 606a. Some parents showed up at the\nBoard’s public business meetings to express their concerns about\nthe storybooks’ content. In an early 2023 meeting, for example, one\nparent represented herself as “a voice for parents in [her]\ncommunity, many of [whom] are actually working today and unable to\nattend.” See MCPS, Jan. 12, 2023, Business Meeting, at 27:15–27:20,\nhttps://mcpsmd.new.swagit.com/videos/196679. She said that MCPS\nparents were “frustrated” because, in their view, “educators and\nadministrators are going behind what [parents] are teaching their\nkids at home, and pushing ideas of gender ideology on their kids.” Id ., at 27:21–27:30. The parent felt that the Board was\n“implying to [children] that their religion, their belief system,\nand their family tradition is actually wrong.” Id ., at\n28:25–28:30. At the same Board meeting, one Board member\nresponded by saying that “some of the testimony today was\ndisturbing to me personally. Transgender, LGBTQ individuals are not\nan ideology, they are a reality. . . . [T]here are\nreligions out there that teach that women should only achieve\ncertain subservient roles in life, and MCPS would never think of\nnot having a book in a classroom that showed a woman” in a\nprofessional role. Id ., at 38:35–39:00. The Board’s student\nmember agreed with the sentiment and proclaimed that “ignorance and\nhate does exist within our community, but please know that every\nstudent—each of our 160,000 students in our large county—has a\nplace in the school system.” Id ., at 40:25–40:36. Initially, the Board compromised with objecting\nparents by notifying them when the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks\nwould be taught and permitting their children to be excused from\ninstruction involving the books. That policy was consistent with\nthe Board’s general “Guidelines for Respecting Religious\nDiversity,” which at the time provided that “[w]hen possible,\nschools should try to make reasonable and feasible adjustments to\nthe instructional program to accommodate requests from students, or\nrequests from parents/guardians on behalf of their students, to be\nexcused from specific classroom discussions or activities that they\nbelieve would impose a substantial burden on their religious\nbeliefs.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 220a–221a. This compromise, however, did not last long. In\nMarch 2023, less than a year after the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” texts\nwere introduced, the Board issued a statement declaring that\n“[s]tudents and families may not choose to opt out of engaging”\nwith the storybooks and that “teachers will not send home letters\nto inform families when inclusive books are read in the future.” Id ., at 657a. According to one MCPS official, the Board\ndecided to change its policy because, among other things,\n“individual principals and teachers could not accommodate the\ngrowing number of opt out requests without causing significant\ndisruptions to the classroom environment.” Id ., at 607a. The\nofficial also stated that permitting some students to exit the\nclassroom while the storybooks were being taught would expose other\nstudents “to social stigma and isolation.” Id ., at 608a. It\nwas therefore announced that any existing accommodations would\nexpire at the end of the 2022–2023 school year. Shortly after the Board rescinded parental opt\nouts, more than 1,000 parents signed a petition asking the Board to\nrestore opt out rights. See Brief for Petitioners 14. And hundreds\nof displeased parents, including many Muslim and Ethiopian Orthodox\nparents, appeared at the Board’s public meetings and implored the\nBoard to allow opt outs. Id ., at 14–15. At a May 2023\nmeeting, one community member testified that “thousands” of parents\nfelt “deeply dismayed and betrayed” by the rescission of opt outs\nfrom “content that conflict[s] with their sincerely held religious\nbeliefs.” MCPS, May 25, 2023, Business Meeting, at 35:33–35:44,\nhttps://mcpsmd.new.swagit.com/videos/‌232766. At the same meeting,\nan MCPS student testified and asked the Board “to allow students\nlike me to opt out of content and books that contain sensitive and\nmature topics that go against my religious beliefs.” Id ., at\n40:47–40:56. The Board was unmoved. After the testimony,\nseveral Board members and another MCPS official spoke up to\n“clarify” that the storybooks would not be used for explicit\ninstruction on sexuality and gender, but rather as part of the\n“literacy curriculum.” Id ., at 1:11:14–1:16:22. According to\na later news article, one Board member recalled that “she felt\n‘kind of sorry’ ” for the student who testified in favor of",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus MAHMOUD et al. v . TAYLOR et al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit No. 24–297. Argued April 22, 2025—Decided June\n27, 2025 During the 2022–2023 school year, the\nMontgomery County Board of Education (Board) introduced a variety\nof “LGBTQ+-inclusive” texts into the public school curriculum.\nThose texts included five “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks approved\nfor students in kindergarten through fifth grade, which have story\nlines focused on sexuality and gender. When parents in Montgomery\nCounty sought to have their children excused from instruction\ninvolving those books, the Board initially compromised with the\nparents by notifying them when the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks\nwould be taught and permitting their children to be excused from\nthe instruction. That compromise was consistent with the Board’s\n“Guidelines for Respecting Religious Diversity,” which professed a\ncommitment to making “reasonable accommodations” for the religious\n“beliefs and practices” of students. Less than a year after the\nBoard introduced the books, however, it rescinded the parental opt\nout policy. Among other things, the Board said that it “could not\naccommodate the growing number of opt out requests without causing\nsignificant disruptions to the classroom environment.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 607a. The petitioners here are a group of individual\nparents and an unincorporated association of other interested\nparties. The individual parents come from diverse religious\nbackgrounds and hold sincere views on sexuality and gender which\nthey wish to pass on to their children. Faced with the Board’s\ndecision to rescind opt outs, petitioners filed a lawsuit in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland. Among\nother things, they asserted that the Board’s no-opt-out policy\ninfringed on parents’ right to the free exercise of their religion.\nSee Kennedy v. Bremerton School Dist ., 597 U.S. 507,\n524. They relied heavily on Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U.S.\n205 , in which the Court recognized that parents have a right\n“to direct the religious upbringing of their children” and that\nthis right can be infringed by laws that pose “a very real threat\nof undermining” the religious beliefs and practices that parents\nwish to instill in their children. Id ., at 218, 233.\nPetitioners sought a preliminary and permanent injunction\n“prohibiting the School Board from forcing [their] children and\nother students—over the objection of their parents—to read, listen\nto, or discuss” the storybooks. App. to Pet. for Cert. 206a. The\nDistrict Court denied relief, and a divided panel of the Fourth\nCircuit affirmed. Held : Parents challenging the\nBoard’s introduction of the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks, along\nwith its decision to withhold opt outs, are entitled to a\npreliminary injunction. Pp. 16–41. (a) The parents assert that the Board’s\nintroduction of the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks—combined with its\ndecision to withhold notice and opt outs—unconstitutionally burdens\ntheir religious exercise. At this stage, the parents seek a\npreliminary injunction that would permit them to have their\nchildren excused from instruction related to the storybooks while\nthis lawsuit proceeds. To obtain that form of preliminary relief,\nthe parents must show that: they are likely to succeed on the\nmerits; they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence\nof preliminary relief; the balance of equities tips in their favor;\nand an injunction would be in the public interest. Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. , 555 U.S.\n7 , 20. The parents have made such a showing. Pp. 16–17. (b) The parents are likely to succeed on\ntheir claim that the Board’s policies unconstitutionally burden\ntheir religious exercise. The Court has “long recognized the rights\nof parents to direct ‘the religious upbringing’ of their children.” Espinoza v. Montana Dept. of Revenue , 591 U.S. 464,\n486 (quoting Yoder , 406 U. S., at 213–214). Those\nrights are violated by government policies that “substantially\ninterfer[e] with the religious development” of children. Yoder , 406 U. S., at 218. Pp. 17–27. (1) For many people of faith, there are\nfew religious acts more important than the religious education of\ntheir children. See Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru , 591 U.S. 732, 754. And the practice of\neducating one’s children in one’s religious beliefs, like all\nreligious acts and practices, receives a generous measure of\nconstitutional protection. The Constitution protects, for example,\na parent’s decision to send his or her child to a private religious\nschool instead of a public school. Pierce v. Society of\nSisters , 268 U.S.\n510 , 532–535. And the Court has recognized limits on the\ngovernment’s ability to interfere with a student’s religious\nupbringing in a public school setting. In West Virginia Bd. of\nEd. v. Barnette , 319 U.S.\n624 , for example, the Court held that a policy requiring public\nschool students to salute the flag could not be enforced against\nJehovah’s Witnesses—who consider the flag a “graven\nimage”—consistent with the First Amendment. Barnette involved an egregious kind of\ndirect coercion: a requirement that students make an affirmation\ncontrary to their parents’ religious beliefs. In Yoder , the\nCourt held that the Free Exercise Clause also protects against\npolicies that impose more subtle forms of interference with the\nreligious upbringing of children. There, the Court considered a\ncompulsory-education law that would place Amish children into “an\nenvironment hostile to Amish beliefs,” where they would face\n“pressure to conform” to contrary viewpoints and lifestyles. 406\nU. S., at 211. The Court concluded that such a law\n“substantially interfer[ed] with the religious development of the\nAmish child” and therefore “carrie[d] with it precisely the kind of\nobjective danger to the free exercise of religion that the First\nAmendment was designed to prevent.” Id ., at 218. Pp.\n18–21. (2) The Board’s introduction of the\n“LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks, combined with its decision to\nwithhold notice to parents and to forbid opt outs, substantially\ninterferes with the religious development of petitioners’ children\nand imposes the kind of burden on religious exercise that Yoder found unacceptable. The books are unmistakably\nnormative. They are designed to present certain values and beliefs\nas things to be celebrated, and certain contrary values and beliefs\nas things to be rejected. Take, for example, the message sent by the\nbooks concerning same-sex marriage. Many Americans “advocate with\nutmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex\nmarriage should not be condoned.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S.\n644 , 679. That group includes each of the parents in this case.\nThe storybooks, however, are designed to present the opposite\nviewpoint to young, impressionable children who are likely to\naccept without question any moral messages conveyed by their\nteacher’s instruction. The storybooks present same-sex weddings as\noccasions for great celebration and suggest that the only rubric\nfor determining whether a marriage is acceptable is whether the\nindividuals concerned “love each other.” The storybooks similarly convey a normative\nmessage on the subjects of sex and gender. Many Americans, like the\nparents in this case, believe that biological sex reflects divine\ncreation, that sex and gender are inseparable, and that children\nshould be encouraged to accept their sex and to live accordingly.\nThe storybooks, however, suggest that it is hurtful, and perhaps\neven hateful, to hold the view that gender is inextricably bound\nwith biological sex. Like the compulsory high school education\nconsidered in Yoder , these books impose upon children a set\nof values and beliefs that are “hostile” to their parents’\nreligious beliefs. Id ., at 211. And the books exert upon\nchildren a psychological “pressure to conform” to their specific\nviewpoints. Ibid. The books therefore present the same kind\nof “objective danger to the free exercise of religion” that the\nCourt identified in Yoder . Id ., at 218. Pp.\n21–27. (c) None of the counterarguments raised\nby the Board, the courts below, or the Board’s amici give us\nany reason to doubt the existence of a burden on religious exercise\nhere. Pp. 27–35. (1) The Court does not accept the Board’s\ncharacterizations of the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” instruction as mere\n“exposure to objectionable ideas” or as lessons in “mutual\nrespect.” The storybooks unmistakably convey a particular viewpoint\nabout same-sex marriage and gender. And the Board has specifically\nencouraged teachers to reinforce this viewpoint and to reprimand\nany children who disagree. That goes beyond mere “exposure.”\nRegardless, the question in cases of this kind is whether the\neducational requirement or curriculum at issue would “substantially\ninterfer[e] with the religious development” of the child, or pose\n“a very real threat of undermining” the religious beliefs and\npractices the parent wishes to instill in the child. Yoder ,\n406 U. S., at 218. Whether or not a requirement or curriculum could\nbe characterized as “exposure” is not the touchstone for\ndetermining whether that line is crossed. Pp. 27–28. (2) The Board’s reliance on the Court’s\ndecisions in Bowen v. Roy , 476\nU.S. 693 , and Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery\nProtective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , is likewise unpersuasive. In those cases, the Court held\nthat “[t]he Free Exercise Clause simply cannot be understood to\nrequire the Government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways\nthat comport with the religious beliefs of particular citizens,” Bowen , 476 U. S., at 699, even when the conduct of such\ninternal affairs might result in “incidental interference with an\nindividual’s spiritual activities,” Lyng , 485 U. S., at\n450. That principle has no application here. The government’s\noperation of public schools is not a matter of “internal affairs”\nakin to the administration of Social Security or the selection of\n“filing cabinets.” Bowen , 476 U. S., at 700. It\nimplicates direct, coercive interactions between the State and its\nyoung residents. Pp. 28–29. (3) The courts below erred by dismissing\nthis Court’s decision in Yoder. The Court has never confined Yoder to its facts, and there is no reason to conclude that\nthe decision is “ sui generis ” or “tailored to [its] specific\nevidence,” as the courts below reasoned. While the Court noted in Yoder that the Amish made a showing “that probably few other\nreligious groups or sects could make,” that language must be read\nin the context of the specific claims raised by the Amish\nrespondents, i.e. , the right to withdraw their children from\nall conventional schooling after a certain age. 406 U. S., at\n235–236. Contrary to the suggestions of the courts below, Yoder embodies a robust principle of general applicability.\nPp. 29–31. (4) The Fourth Circuit’s view that the\nrecord in this case is too “threadbare” to demonstrate a burden on\nreligious exercise is also unconvincing. 102 F. 4th 191, 209. That\ncourt faulted the parents for failing to make specific allegations\ndescribing how the books “are actually being used in classrooms.” Id ., at 213. But when a deprivation of First Amendment\nrights is at stake, a plaintiff need not wait for the damage to\noccur before filing suit. Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus , 573 U.S.\n149 , 158. To evaluate the plaintiffs’ claims, the Court need\nonly decide whether—if teachers act according to the clear and\nundisputed instructions of the Board—a burden on religious exercise\nwill occur. Pp. 31–32. (5) It is no answer that parents remain\nfree to place their children in private school or to educate them\nat home. Public education is a public benefit, and the government\ncannot “condition” its “availability” on parents’ willingness to\naccept a burden on their religious exercise. Trinity Lutheran\nChurch of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U.S. 449, 462.\nMoreover, given that education is compulsory in Maryland, the\nparents are not being asked simply to forgo a public benefit. They\nhave an obligation—enforceable by fine or imprisonment—to send\ntheir children to public school unless they find an adequate\nsubstitute they can afford. §§7–301(a)(3), (e). Nor is it of any comfort to suggest that\nparents can educate their children at home after school. The\nparents in Barnette and Yoder were similarly capable\nof teaching their religious values “at home,” but that made no\ndifference in the First Amendment analysis in those cases. It is\nsimilarly unconvincing to suggest that the parents could have\nchallenged the educational requirements via the democratic process.\nThe parents tried and failed to obtain legislative change, and had\nevery right to resort to judicial review to protect their rights.\nPp. 32–35. (d) Having concluded that the Board’s\npolicy burdens the parents’ right to the free exercise of religion,\nthe Court turns to the question whether that burden is\nconstitutionally permitted. Pp. 35–40. (1) In most circumstances, the government\nis generally free to place incidental burdens on religious exercise\nso long as it does so pursuant to a neutral policy that is\ngenerally applicable. Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources\nof Ore. v. Smith , 494 U.S.\n872 , 878–879. But when a law imposes a burden of the same\ncharacter as that in Yoder , as does the challenged Board\npolicy here, strict scrutiny is appropriate regardless of whether\nthe law is neutral or generally applicable. Smith , 494\nU. S., at 881. Pp. 35–37. (2) To survive strict scrutiny, a\ngovernment must demonstrate that its policy “advances ‘interests of\nthe highest order’ and is narrowly tailored to achieve those\ninterests.” Fulton v. Philadelphia , 593 U.S. 522, 541\n(quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc . v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546). The Board asserts that its curriculum and no-opt-out\npolicy serve its compelling interest in maintaining a school\nenvironment that is safe and conducive to learning for all\nstudents. As a general matter, schools have a “compelling interest\nin having an undisrupted school session conducive to the students’\nlearning.” Grayned v. City of Rockford , 408 U.S.\n104 , 119. But the Board’s conduct in continuing to permit opt\nouts in a variety of other circumstances undermines its assertion\nthat its no-opt-out policy is necessary to serve that interest. Pp.\n37–40. (e) Without an injunction, the parents\nwill continue to suffer an unconstitutional burden on their\nreligious exercise, and such a burden unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury. See Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 592 U.S. 14, 19 ( per curiam ). And an\ninjunction here would be both equitable and in the public interest.\nThus, the petitioners have shown that they are entitled to a\npreliminary injunction. Specifically, until all appellate review in\nthis case is completed, the Board should be ordered to notify the\npetitioners in advance whenever one of the books in question or any\nother similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to\nhave their children excused from that instruction. Pp. 40–41. 102 F. 4th 191, reversed and remanded. Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court,\nin which Roberts, C. J., and Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and\nBarrett, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 24–297 _________________ Tamer Mahmoud, et al., PETITIONERS v. Thomas W. Taylor, et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fourth circuit [June 27, 2025] Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. The Board of Education of Montgomery County,\nMaryland (Board), has introduced a variety of “LGBTQ+-inclusive”\nstorybooks into the elementary school curriculum. These books—and\nassociated educational instructions provided to teachers—are\ndesigned to “disrupt” children’s thinking about sexuality and\ngender. The Board has told parents that it will not give them\nnotice when the books are going to be used and that their\nchildren’s attendance during those periods is mandatory. A group of\nparents from diverse religious backgrounds sued to enjoin those\npolicies. They assert that the new curriculum, combined with the\nBoard’s decision to deny opt outs, impermissibly burdens their\nreligious exercise. Today, we hold that the parents have shown that\nthey are entitled to a preliminary injunction. A government burdens\nthe religious exercise of parents when it requires them to submit\ntheir children to instruction that poses “a very real threat of\nundermining” the religious beliefs and practices that the parents\nwish to instill. Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406\nU.S. 205 , 218 (1972). And a government cannot condition the\nbenefit of free public education on parents’ acceptance of such\ninstruction. Based on these principles, we conclude that the\nparents are likely to succeed in their challenge to the Board’s\npolicies. I A 1 With just over one million residents,\nMontgomery County is Maryland’s most populous county. According to\na recent survey, it is also the “most religiously diverse county”\nin the Nation.[ 1 ] In addition\nto hosting a diverse mix of Christian denominations, the county\nranks in the top five in the Nation in per-capita population of\nJews, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists.[ 2 ] The county’s religious diversity is accompanied by\nstrong cultural diversity as well. The county is home to several\nnotable ethnic communities. For example, the Ethiopian community in\nSilver Spring is one of the largest in the country.[ 3 ] And according to one survey, “[o]nly 56.8%\nof county residents speak English at home.” N. 1, supra . Most Montgomery County residents with school age\nchildren, by choice or necessity, send them to public school. As a\ngeneral matter, Maryland law requires that resident children ages 5\nto 18 “attend a public school regularly during the entire school\nyear.” Md. Educ. Code Ann. §7–301(a–1)(1) (2025). As an exception\nto this general rule, the State permits parents to send their\nchildren to private school or to educate them at home if certain\nrequirements can be met. §7–301(a)(3). Parents who cause their\nchildren to be absent unlawfully from school can face fines,\nmandatory community service, and even imprisonment. §7–301(e). Public education in Montgomery County is\nprovided by Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS), one of the\nlargest school districts in the Nation. In the 2022–2023 school\nyear, MCPS enrolled 160,554 students in its 210 schools and had an\noperating budget of nearly $3 billion. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n597a–598a; MCPS, FY2024 Operating Budget, p. vi–1 (2023). The\ndistrict is overseen and managed by the Montgomery County Board of\nEducation, a policymaking body consisting of seven elected county\nresidents and one student. See Md. Educ. Code Ann. §3–901(b). In recognition of the county’s religious\ndiversity, the Board’s “Guidelines for Respecting Religious\nDiversity” profess a commitment to making “reasonable\naccommodations” for the religious “beliefs and practices” of MCPS\nstudents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 210a, 212a.[ 4 ] These accommodations take various forms. For\nexample, according to one MCPS official, the Board “advises\nprincipals that schools should avoid scheduling tests or other\nmajor events on dozens of . . . ‘days of commemoration,’\nduring which MCPS expects that many students may be absent\n. . . or engaged in religious or cultural observances.” Id ., at 602a. This case, however, arises from the Board’s\nabject refusal to heed widespread and impassioned pleas for\naccommodation. In the years leading up to 2022, the Board\napparently “determined that the books used in its existing [English\n& Language Arts] curriculum were not representative of many\nstudents and families in Montgomery County because they did not\ninclude LGBTQ characters.” Id ., at 603a. The Board therefore\ndecided to introduce into the curriculum what it described as\n“ ‘LGBTQ+-inclusive texts.’ ”[ 5 ] Id ., at 174a. As one email sent by MCPS\nprincipals reflects, the Board selected the books according to a\n“Critical Selection Repertoire” that required selectors to review\npotential texts and ask questions such as: “Is heteronormativity\nreinforced or disrupted?”; “Is cisnormativity reinforced or\ndisrupted?”; and “Are power hierarchies that uphold the dominant\nculture reinforced or disrupted?” Id ., at 622a. In accordance with this “[r]epertoire” and other\ncriteria, the Board eventually selected 13 “LGBTQ+-inclusive” texts\nfor use in the English and Language Arts curriculum from pre-K\nthrough 12th grade. Id ., at 603a–604a, 622a. At issue in\nthis lawsuit are the five “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks that are\napproved for students in Kindergarten through fifth grade—in other\nwords, for children who are generally between 5 and 11 years\nold.[ 6 ] A few short descriptions will serve to\nillustrate the general tenor of the storybooks. Intersection Allies\ntells the stories of several children from different backgrounds,\nincluding Kate, who is apparently a transgender child. One page\nshows Kate in a sex-neutral or sex-ambiguous bathroom, and Kate\nproclaims: “My friends defend my choices and place. A bathroom,\nlike all rooms, should be a safe space.” Id ., at 323a.\nIntersection Allies includes a “Page-By-Page Book Discussion Guide”\nthat asserts: “When we are born, our gender is often decided for us\nbased on our sex . . . . But at any point in our\nlives, we can choose to identify with one gender, multiple genders,\nor neither gender.” Id ., at 349a–350a. The discussion guide\nexplains that “Kate prefers the pronouns they/their/them” and asks\n“ What pronouns fit you best? ” Id ., at 350a (boldface\nin original). Prince & Knight tells the story of a\ncoming-of-age prince whose parents wish to match him with “a kind\nand worthy bride.” Id ., at 397a. After meeting with “many\nladies,” the prince tells his parents that he is “ ‘looking\nfor something different in a partner by [his] side.’ ” Id ., at 398a, 400a. Later in the book, the prince falls into\nthe “embrace” of a knight after the two finish battling a fearsome\ndragon. Id ., at 415a. After the knight takes off his helmet,\nthe prince and knight “gaz[e] into each other’s eyes, [and] their\nhearts beg[in] to race.” Id ., at 418a–419a. The whole\nkingdom later applauds “on the two men’s wedding day.” Id .,\nat 424a. Love Violet follows a young girl named Violet\nwho has a crush on her female classmate, Mira. Mira makes Violet’s\n“heart skip” and “thunde[r] like a hundred galloping horses.” Id ., at 431a, 436a. Although Violet is initially too afraid\nto interact with Mira, the two end up exchanging gifts on\nValentine’s Day. Afterwards, the two girls are seen holding hands\nand “galloping over snowy drifts to see what they might find.\nTogether.” Id ., at 446a. Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named\nPenelope tells the story of Penelope, a child who is initially\ntreated as a girl. The story is told from the perspective of\nPenelope, who at one point says “If they’d all stop and listen, I’d\ntell them about me. Inside I’m a boy.” Id ., at 454a. When\nPenelope’s mother later assures her that “ ‘If you feel like a\nboy, that’s okay,’ ” Penelope responds: “ ‘No, Mama, I\ndon’t feel like a boy. I AM a boy.’ ” Id ., at\n458a. Penelope tells her mother: “ ‘I love you, Mama, but I don’t want\nto be you. I want to be Papa. I don’t want tomorrow to come\nbecause tomorrow I’ll look like you. Please help me, Mama. Help me\nto be a boy.’ ” Id. , at 459a. Penelope’s mother then agrees that she is a boy,\nand Penelope says: “For the first time, my insides don’t feel like\nfire. They feel like warm, golden love.” Id ., at 462a.\nLater, after the family starts treating Penelope as a boy,\nPenelope’s brother complains that “ ‘You can’t become a\nboy. You have to be born one.’ ” Id ., at 465a. This\ncomment draws a rebuke from Penelope’s mother: “ ‘Not\neverything needs to make sense. This is about\nlove .’ ” Ibid . Finally, Uncle Bobby’s Wedding tells the story\nof a young girl named Chloe who is informed that her favorite\nuncle, Bobby, will be getting married to his boyfriend, Jamie. When\nBobby and Jamie announce their engagement, everyone is jubilant\n“except . . . Chloe.” Id ., at 287a. Chloe says\nthat she does not “ ‘understand’ ” why her uncle is\ngetting married, but her mother responds by explaining:\n“ ‘When grown-up people love each other that much, sometimes\nthey get married.’ ” Id ., at 288a. The Board suggested “that teachers incorporate\nthe new texts into the curriculum in the same way that other books\nare used, namely, to put them on a shelf for students to find on\ntheir own; to recommend a book to a student who would enjoy it; to\noffer the books as an option for literature circles, book clubs, or\npaired reading groups; or to use them as a read aloud.” Id .,\nat 604a–605a. And “[a]s with all curriculum resources,” the Board\nvoiced its “expectation that teachers use the LGBTQ-Inclusive Books\nas part of instruction.” Id ., at 605a. An MCPS official has\nmade clear that “[t]eachers cannot . . . elect not to use\nthe LGBTQ-Inclusive Books at all.” Ibid. The Board also contemplated that instruction\ninvolving the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks would include classroom\ndiscussion. See id ., at 642a (Board’s lawyer: “there will be\ndiscussion that ensues. In fact, I think everyone would hope that\ndiscussion ensues”). In anticipation of such discussion, the Board\nhosted a “professional development workshop” in the summer of 2022,\nwhere it provided teachers with a guidance document suggesting how\nthey might respond to student inquiries regarding the themes\npresented in the books. Id ., at 273a–276a, 604a, 628a–635a.\nFor example, if a student asserts that two men cannot get married,\nthe guidance document encouraged teachers to respond by saying:\n“When people are adults they can get married. Two men who love each\nother can decide they want to get married.” Id ., at 628a. If\na student claims that a character “can’t be a boy if he was born a\ngirl,” teachers were encouraged to respond: “That comment is\nhurtful.” Id ., at 630a. And if a student asks “[w]hat’s\ntransgender?”, it was recommended that teachers explain: “When\nwe’re born, people make a guess about our gender and label us ‘boy’\nor ‘girl’ based on our body parts. Sometimes they’re right and\nsometimes they’re wrong.” Ibid . The guidance document\nencouraged teachers to “[d]isrupt the either/or thinking” of their\nstudents. Id ., at 629a, 633a. At the same workshop, the Board also provided\nteachers with a guidance document that suggested particular\nresponses to inquiries by parents. For example, if a parent were to\nask whether the school was attempting to teach a child to “reject”\nthe values taught at home, teachers were encouraged to respond that\n“[t]eaching about LGBTQ+ is not about making students think a\ncertain way; it is to show that there is no one ‘right’ or ‘normal’\nway to be.” Id ., at 638a. The guidance also urged teachers\nto assure parents that there would not be “explicit instruction”\nabout gender and sexual identity, but that “there may be a need to\ndefine words that are new and unfamiliar to students,” and that\n“questions and conversations might organically happen.” Id .,\nat 640a. If parents were not comforted by that information,\nteachers could tell them that “[p]arents always have the choice to\nkeep their student(s) home while using these texts; however, it\nwill not be an excused absence.” Ibid. 2 The Board officially launched the\n“LGBTQ+-inclusive” texts into MCPS schools in the 2022–2023 school\nyear. Shortly thereafter, parents “began contacting individual\nteachers, principals, or MCPS staff ” about the storybooks and\nasking that their children be excused from classroom instruction\nrelated to them. Id ., at 606a. Some parents showed up at the\nBoard’s public business meetings to express their concerns about\nthe storybooks’ content. In an early 2023 meeting, for example, one\nparent represented herself as “a voice for parents in [her]\ncommunity, many of [whom] are actually working today and unable to\nattend.” See MCPS, Jan. 12, 2023, Business Meeting, at 27:15–27:20,\nhttps://mcpsmd.new.swagit.com/videos/196679. She said that MCPS\nparents were “frustrated” because, in their view, “educators and\nadministrators are going behind what [parents] are teaching their\nkids at home, and pushing ideas of gender ideology on their kids.” Id ., at 27:21–27:30. The parent felt that the Board was\n“implying to [children] that their religion, their belief system,\nand their family tradition is actually wrong.” Id ., at\n28:25–28:30. At the same Board meeting, one Board member\nresponded by saying that “some of the testimony today was\ndisturbing to me personally. Transgender, LGBTQ individuals are not\nan ideology, they are a reality. . . . [T]here are\nreligions out there that teach that women should only achieve\ncertain subservient roles in life, and MCPS would never think of\nnot having a book in a classroom that showed a woman” in a\nprofessional role. Id ., at 38:35–39:00. The Board’s student\nmember agreed with the sentiment and proclaimed that “ignorance and\nhate does exist within our community, but please know that every\nstudent—each of our 160,000 students in our large county—has a\nplace in the school system.” Id ., at 40:25–40:36. Initially, the Board compromised with objecting\nparents by notifying them when the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks\nwould be taught and permitting their children to be excused from\ninstruction involving the books. That policy was consistent with\nthe Board’s general “Guidelines for Respecting Religious\nDiversity,” which at the time provided that “[w]hen possible,\nschools should try to make reasonable and feasible adjustments to\nthe instructional program to accommodate requests from students, or\nrequests from parents/guardians on behalf of their students, to be\nexcused from specific classroom discussions or activities that they\nbelieve would impose a substantial burden on their religious\nbeliefs.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 220a–221a. This compromise, however, did not last long. In\nMarch 2023, less than a year after the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” texts\nwere introduced, the Board issued a statement declaring that\n“[s]tudents and families may not choose to opt out of engaging”\nwith the storybooks and that “teachers will not send home letters\nto inform families when inclusive books are read in the future.” Id ., at 657a. According to one MCPS official, the Board\ndecided to change its policy because, among other things,\n“individual principals and teachers could not accommodate the\ngrowing number of opt out requests without causing significant\ndisruptions to the classroom environment.” Id ., at 607a. The\nofficial also stated that permitting some students to exit the\nclassroom while the storybooks were being taught would expose other\nstudents “to social stigma and isolation.” Id ., at 608a. It\nwas therefore announced that any existing accommodations would\nexpire at the end of the 2022–2023 school year. Shortly after the Board rescinded parental opt\nouts, more than 1,000 parents signed a petition asking the Board to\nrestore opt out rights. See Brief for Petitioners 14. And hundreds\nof displeased parents, including many Muslim and Ethiopian Orthodox\nparents, appeared at the Board’s public meetings and implored the\nBoard to allow opt outs. Id ., at 14–15. At a May 2023\nmeeting, one community member testified that “thousands” of parents\nfelt “deeply dismayed and betrayed” by the rescission of opt outs\nfrom “content that conflict[s] with their sincerely held religious\nbeliefs.” MCPS, May 25, 2023, Business Meeting, at 35:33–35:44,\nhttps://mcpsmd.new.swagit.com/videos/‌232766. At the same meeting,\nan MCPS student testified and asked the Board “to allow students\nlike me to opt out of content and books that contain sensitive and\nmature topics that go against my religious beliefs.” Id ., at\n40:47–40:56. The Board was unmoved. After the testimony,\nseveral Board members and another MCPS official spoke up to\n“clarify” that the storybooks would not be used for explicit\ninstruction on sexuality and gender, but rather as part of the\n“literacy curriculum.” Id ., at 1:11:14–1:16:22. According to\na later news article, one Board member recalled that “she felt\n‘kind of sorry’ ” for the student who testified in favor of",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus MAHMOUD et al. v . TAYLOR et al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the fourth circuit No. 24–297. Argued April 22, 2025—Decided June\n27, 2025 During the 2022–2023 school year, the\nMontgomery County Board of Education (Board) introduced a variety\nof “LGBTQ+-inclusive” texts into the public school curriculum.\nThose texts included five “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks approved\nfor students in kindergarten through fifth grade, which have story\nlines focused on sexuality and gender. When parents in Montgomery\nCounty sought to have their children excused from instruction\ninvolving those books, the Board initially compromised with the\nparents by notifying them when the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks\nwould be taught and permitting their children to be excused from\nthe instruction. That compromise was consistent with the Board’s\n“Guidelines for Respecting Religious Diversity,” which professed a\ncommitment to making “reasonable accommodations” for the religious\n“beliefs and practices” of students. Less than a year after the\nBoard introduced the books, however, it rescinded the parental opt\nout policy. Among other things, the Board said that it “could not\naccommodate the growing number of opt out requests without causing\nsignificant disruptions to the classroom environment.” App. to Pet.\nfor Cert. 607a. The petitioners here are a group of individual\nparents and an unincorporated association of other interested\nparties. The individual parents come from diverse religious\nbackgrounds and hold sincere views on sexuality and gender which\nthey wish to pass on to their children. Faced with the Board’s\ndecision to rescind opt outs, petitioners filed a lawsuit in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maryland. Among\nother things, they asserted that the Board’s no-opt-out policy\ninfringed on parents’ right to the free exercise of their religion.\nSee Kennedy v. Bremerton School Dist ., 597 U.S. 507,\n524. They relied heavily on Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406 U.S.\n205 , in which the Court recognized that parents have a right\n“to direct the religious upbringing of their children” and that\nthis right can be infringed by laws that pose “a very real threat\nof undermining” the religious beliefs and practices that parents\nwish to instill in their children. Id ., at 218, 233.\nPetitioners sought a preliminary and permanent injunction\n“prohibiting the School Board from forcing [their] children and\nother students—over the objection of their parents—to read, listen\nto, or discuss” the storybooks. App. to Pet. for Cert. 206a. The\nDistrict Court denied relief, and a divided panel of the Fourth\nCircuit affirmed. Held : Parents challenging the\nBoard’s introduction of the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks, along\nwith its decision to withhold opt outs, are entitled to a\npreliminary injunction. Pp. 16–41. (a) The parents assert that the Board’s\nintroduction of the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks—combined with its\ndecision to withhold notice and opt outs—unconstitutionally burdens\ntheir religious exercise. At this stage, the parents seek a\npreliminary injunction that would permit them to have their\nchildren excused from instruction related to the storybooks while\nthis lawsuit proceeds. To obtain that form of preliminary relief,\nthe parents must show that: they are likely to succeed on the\nmerits; they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence\nof preliminary relief; the balance of equities tips in their favor;\nand an injunction would be in the public interest. Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. , 555 U.S.\n7 , 20. The parents have made such a showing. Pp. 16–17. (b) The parents are likely to succeed on\ntheir claim that the Board’s policies unconstitutionally burden\ntheir religious exercise. The Court has “long recognized the rights\nof parents to direct ‘the religious upbringing’ of their children.” Espinoza v. Montana Dept. of Revenue , 591 U.S. 464,\n486 (quoting Yoder , 406 U. S., at 213–214). Those\nrights are violated by government policies that “substantially\ninterfer[e] with the religious development” of children. Yoder , 406 U. S., at 218. Pp. 17–27. (1) For many people of faith, there are\nfew religious acts more important than the religious education of\ntheir children. See Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru , 591 U.S. 732, 754. And the practice of\neducating one’s children in one’s religious beliefs, like all\nreligious acts and practices, receives a generous measure of\nconstitutional protection. The Constitution protects, for example,\na parent’s decision to send his or her child to a private religious\nschool instead of a public school. Pierce v. Society of\nSisters , 268 U.S.\n510 , 532–535. And the Court has recognized limits on the\ngovernment’s ability to interfere with a student’s religious\nupbringing in a public school setting. In West Virginia Bd. of\nEd. v. Barnette , 319 U.S.\n624 , for example, the Court held that a policy requiring public\nschool students to salute the flag could not be enforced against\nJehovah’s Witnesses—who consider the flag a “graven\nimage”—consistent with the First Amendment. Barnette involved an egregious kind of\ndirect coercion: a requirement that students make an affirmation\ncontrary to their parents’ religious beliefs. In Yoder , the\nCourt held that the Free Exercise Clause also protects against\npolicies that impose more subtle forms of interference with the\nreligious upbringing of children. There, the Court considered a\ncompulsory-education law that would place Amish children into “an\nenvironment hostile to Amish beliefs,” where they would face\n“pressure to conform” to contrary viewpoints and lifestyles. 406\nU. S., at 211. The Court concluded that such a law\n“substantially interfer[ed] with the religious development of the\nAmish child” and therefore “carrie[d] with it precisely the kind of\nobjective danger to the free exercise of religion that the First\nAmendment was designed to prevent.” Id ., at 218. Pp.\n18–21. (2) The Board’s introduction of the\n“LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks, combined with its decision to\nwithhold notice to parents and to forbid opt outs, substantially\ninterferes with the religious development of petitioners’ children\nand imposes the kind of burden on religious exercise that Yoder found unacceptable. The books are unmistakably\nnormative. They are designed to present certain values and beliefs\nas things to be celebrated, and certain contrary values and beliefs\nas things to be rejected. Take, for example, the message sent by the\nbooks concerning same-sex marriage. Many Americans “advocate with\nutmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex\nmarriage should not be condoned.” Obergefell v. Hodges , 576 U.S.\n644 , 679. That group includes each of the parents in this case.\nThe storybooks, however, are designed to present the opposite\nviewpoint to young, impressionable children who are likely to\naccept without question any moral messages conveyed by their\nteacher’s instruction. The storybooks present same-sex weddings as\noccasions for great celebration and suggest that the only rubric\nfor determining whether a marriage is acceptable is whether the\nindividuals concerned “love each other.” The storybooks similarly convey a normative\nmessage on the subjects of sex and gender. Many Americans, like the\nparents in this case, believe that biological sex reflects divine\ncreation, that sex and gender are inseparable, and that children\nshould be encouraged to accept their sex and to live accordingly.\nThe storybooks, however, suggest that it is hurtful, and perhaps\neven hateful, to hold the view that gender is inextricably bound\nwith biological sex. Like the compulsory high school education\nconsidered in Yoder , these books impose upon children a set\nof values and beliefs that are “hostile” to their parents’\nreligious beliefs. Id ., at 211. And the books exert upon\nchildren a psychological “pressure to conform” to their specific\nviewpoints. Ibid. The books therefore present the same kind\nof “objective danger to the free exercise of religion” that the\nCourt identified in Yoder . Id ., at 218. Pp.\n21–27. (c) None of the counterarguments raised\nby the Board, the courts below, or the Board’s amici give us\nany reason to doubt the existence of a burden on religious exercise\nhere. Pp. 27–35. (1) The Court does not accept the Board’s\ncharacterizations of the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” instruction as mere\n“exposure to objectionable ideas” or as lessons in “mutual\nrespect.” The storybooks unmistakably convey a particular viewpoint\nabout same-sex marriage and gender. And the Board has specifically\nencouraged teachers to reinforce this viewpoint and to reprimand\nany children who disagree. That goes beyond mere “exposure.”\nRegardless, the question in cases of this kind is whether the\neducational requirement or curriculum at issue would “substantially\ninterfer[e] with the religious development” of the child, or pose\n“a very real threat of undermining” the religious beliefs and\npractices the parent wishes to instill in the child. Yoder ,\n406 U. S., at 218. Whether or not a requirement or curriculum could\nbe characterized as “exposure” is not the touchstone for\ndetermining whether that line is crossed. Pp. 27–28. (2) The Board’s reliance on the Court’s\ndecisions in Bowen v. Roy , 476\nU.S. 693 , and Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery\nProtective Assn. , 485 U.S.\n439 , is likewise unpersuasive. In those cases, the Court held\nthat “[t]he Free Exercise Clause simply cannot be understood to\nrequire the Government to conduct its own internal affairs in ways\nthat comport with the religious beliefs of particular citizens,” Bowen , 476 U. S., at 699, even when the conduct of such\ninternal affairs might result in “incidental interference with an\nindividual’s spiritual activities,” Lyng , 485 U. S., at\n450. That principle has no application here. The government’s\noperation of public schools is not a matter of “internal affairs”\nakin to the administration of Social Security or the selection of\n“filing cabinets.” Bowen , 476 U. S., at 700. It\nimplicates direct, coercive interactions between the State and its\nyoung residents. Pp. 28–29. (3) The courts below erred by dismissing\nthis Court’s decision in Yoder. The Court has never confined Yoder to its facts, and there is no reason to conclude that\nthe decision is “ sui generis ” or “tailored to [its] specific\nevidence,” as the courts below reasoned. While the Court noted in Yoder that the Amish made a showing “that probably few other\nreligious groups or sects could make,” that language must be read\nin the context of the specific claims raised by the Amish\nrespondents, i.e. , the right to withdraw their children from\nall conventional schooling after a certain age. 406 U. S., at\n235–236. Contrary to the suggestions of the courts below, Yoder embodies a robust principle of general applicability.\nPp. 29–31. (4) The Fourth Circuit’s view that the\nrecord in this case is too “threadbare” to demonstrate a burden on\nreligious exercise is also unconvincing. 102 F. 4th 191, 209. That\ncourt faulted the parents for failing to make specific allegations\ndescribing how the books “are actually being used in classrooms.” Id ., at 213. But when a deprivation of First Amendment\nrights is at stake, a plaintiff need not wait for the damage to\noccur before filing suit. Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus , 573 U.S.\n149 , 158. To evaluate the plaintiffs’ claims, the Court need\nonly decide whether—if teachers act according to the clear and\nundisputed instructions of the Board—a burden on religious exercise\nwill occur. Pp. 31–32. (5) It is no answer that parents remain\nfree to place their children in private school or to educate them\nat home. Public education is a public benefit, and the government\ncannot “condition” its “availability” on parents’ willingness to\naccept a burden on their religious exercise. Trinity Lutheran\nChurch of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer , 582 U.S. 449, 462.\nMoreover, given that education is compulsory in Maryland, the\nparents are not being asked simply to forgo a public benefit. They\nhave an obligation—enforceable by fine or imprisonment—to send\ntheir children to public school unless they find an adequate\nsubstitute they can afford. §§7–301(a)(3), (e). Nor is it of any comfort to suggest that\nparents can educate their children at home after school. The\nparents in Barnette and Yoder were similarly capable\nof teaching their religious values “at home,” but that made no\ndifference in the First Amendment analysis in those cases. It is\nsimilarly unconvincing to suggest that the parents could have\nchallenged the educational requirements via the democratic process.\nThe parents tried and failed to obtain legislative change, and had\nevery right to resort to judicial review to protect their rights.\nPp. 32–35. (d) Having concluded that the Board’s\npolicy burdens the parents’ right to the free exercise of religion,\nthe Court turns to the question whether that burden is\nconstitutionally permitted. Pp. 35–40. (1) In most circumstances, the government\nis generally free to place incidental burdens on religious exercise\nso long as it does so pursuant to a neutral policy that is\ngenerally applicable. Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources\nof Ore. v. Smith , 494 U.S.\n872 , 878–879. But when a law imposes a burden of the same\ncharacter as that in Yoder , as does the challenged Board\npolicy here, strict scrutiny is appropriate regardless of whether\nthe law is neutral or generally applicable. Smith , 494\nU. S., at 881. Pp. 35–37. (2) To survive strict scrutiny, a\ngovernment must demonstrate that its policy “advances ‘interests of\nthe highest order’ and is narrowly tailored to achieve those\ninterests.” Fulton v. Philadelphia , 593 U.S. 522, 541\n(quoting Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc . v. Hialeah , 508 U.S.\n520 , 546). The Board asserts that its curriculum and no-opt-out\npolicy serve its compelling interest in maintaining a school\nenvironment that is safe and conducive to learning for all\nstudents. As a general matter, schools have a “compelling interest\nin having an undisrupted school session conducive to the students’\nlearning.” Grayned v. City of Rockford , 408 U.S.\n104 , 119. But the Board’s conduct in continuing to permit opt\nouts in a variety of other circumstances undermines its assertion\nthat its no-opt-out policy is necessary to serve that interest. Pp.\n37–40. (e) Without an injunction, the parents\nwill continue to suffer an unconstitutional burden on their\nreligious exercise, and such a burden unquestionably constitutes\nirreparable injury. See Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo , 592 U.S. 14, 19 ( per curiam ). And an\ninjunction here would be both equitable and in the public interest.\nThus, the petitioners have shown that they are entitled to a\npreliminary injunction. Specifically, until all appellate review in\nthis case is completed, the Board should be ordered to notify the\npetitioners in advance whenever one of the books in question or any\nother similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to\nhave their children excused from that instruction. Pp. 40–41. 102 F. 4th 191, reversed and remanded. Alito, J., delivered the opinion of the Court,\nin which Roberts, C. J., and Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and\nBarrett, JJ., joined.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 24–297 _________________ Tamer Mahmoud, et al., PETITIONERS v. Thomas W. Taylor, et al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the fourth circuit [June 27, 2025] Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. The Board of Education of Montgomery County,\nMaryland (Board), has introduced a variety of “LGBTQ+-inclusive”\nstorybooks into the elementary school curriculum. These books—and\nassociated educational instructions provided to teachers—are\ndesigned to “disrupt” children’s thinking about sexuality and\ngender. The Board has told parents that it will not give them\nnotice when the books are going to be used and that their\nchildren’s attendance during those periods is mandatory. A group of\nparents from diverse religious backgrounds sued to enjoin those\npolicies. They assert that the new curriculum, combined with the\nBoard’s decision to deny opt outs, impermissibly burdens their\nreligious exercise. Today, we hold that the parents have shown that\nthey are entitled to a preliminary injunction. A government burdens\nthe religious exercise of parents when it requires them to submit\ntheir children to instruction that poses “a very real threat of\nundermining” the religious beliefs and practices that the parents\nwish to instill. Wisconsin v. Yoder , 406\nU.S. 205 , 218 (1972). And a government cannot condition the\nbenefit of free public education on parents’ acceptance of such\ninstruction. Based on these principles, we conclude that the\nparents are likely to succeed in their challenge to the Board’s\npolicies. I A 1 With just over one million residents,\nMontgomery County is Maryland’s most populous county. According to\na recent survey, it is also the “most religiously diverse county”\nin the Nation.[ 1 ] In addition\nto hosting a diverse mix of Christian denominations, the county\nranks in the top five in the Nation in per-capita population of\nJews, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists.[ 2 ] The county’s religious diversity is accompanied by\nstrong cultural diversity as well. The county is home to several\nnotable ethnic communities. For example, the Ethiopian community in\nSilver Spring is one of the largest in the country.[ 3 ] And according to one survey, “[o]nly 56.8%\nof county residents speak English at home.” N. 1, supra . Most Montgomery County residents with school age\nchildren, by choice or necessity, send them to public school. As a\ngeneral matter, Maryland law requires that resident children ages 5\nto 18 “attend a public school regularly during the entire school\nyear.” Md. Educ. Code Ann. §7–301(a–1)(1) (2025). As an exception\nto this general rule, the State permits parents to send their\nchildren to private school or to educate them at home if certain\nrequirements can be met. §7–301(a)(3). Parents who cause their\nchildren to be absent unlawfully from school can face fines,\nmandatory community service, and even imprisonment. §7–301(e). Public education in Montgomery County is\nprovided by Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS), one of the\nlargest school districts in the Nation. In the 2022–2023 school\nyear, MCPS enrolled 160,554 students in its 210 schools and had an\noperating budget of nearly $3 billion. App. to Pet. for Cert.\n597a–598a; MCPS, FY2024 Operating Budget, p. vi–1 (2023). The\ndistrict is overseen and managed by the Montgomery County Board of\nEducation, a policymaking body consisting of seven elected county\nresidents and one student. See Md. Educ. Code Ann. §3–901(b). In recognition of the county’s religious\ndiversity, the Board’s “Guidelines for Respecting Religious\nDiversity” profess a commitment to making “reasonable\naccommodations” for the religious “beliefs and practices” of MCPS\nstudents. App. to Pet. for Cert. 210a, 212a.[ 4 ] These accommodations take various forms. For\nexample, according to one MCPS official, the Board “advises\nprincipals that schools should avoid scheduling tests or other\nmajor events on dozens of . . . ‘days of commemoration,’\nduring which MCPS expects that many students may be absent\n. . . or engaged in religious or cultural observances.” Id ., at 602a. This case, however, arises from the Board’s\nabject refusal to heed widespread and impassioned pleas for\naccommodation. In the years leading up to 2022, the Board\napparently “determined that the books used in its existing [English\n& Language Arts] curriculum were not representative of many\nstudents and families in Montgomery County because they did not\ninclude LGBTQ characters.” Id ., at 603a. The Board therefore\ndecided to introduce into the curriculum what it described as\n“ ‘LGBTQ+-inclusive texts.’ ”[ 5 ] Id ., at 174a. As one email sent by MCPS\nprincipals reflects, the Board selected the books according to a\n“Critical Selection Repertoire” that required selectors to review\npotential texts and ask questions such as: “Is heteronormativity\nreinforced or disrupted?”; “Is cisnormativity reinforced or\ndisrupted?”; and “Are power hierarchies that uphold the dominant\nculture reinforced or disrupted?” Id ., at 622a. In accordance with this “[r]epertoire” and other\ncriteria, the Board eventually selected 13 “LGBTQ+-inclusive” texts\nfor use in the English and Language Arts curriculum from pre-K\nthrough 12th grade. Id ., at 603a–604a, 622a. At issue in\nthis lawsuit are the five “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks that are\napproved for students in Kindergarten through fifth grade—in other\nwords, for children who are generally between 5 and 11 years\nold.[ 6 ] A few short descriptions will serve to\nillustrate the general tenor of the storybooks. Intersection Allies\ntells the stories of several children from different backgrounds,\nincluding Kate, who is apparently a transgender child. One page\nshows Kate in a sex-neutral or sex-ambiguous bathroom, and Kate\nproclaims: “My friends defend my choices and place. A bathroom,\nlike all rooms, should be a safe space.” Id ., at 323a.\nIntersection Allies includes a “Page-By-Page Book Discussion Guide”\nthat asserts: “When we are born, our gender is often decided for us\nbased on our sex . . . . But at any point in our\nlives, we can choose to identify with one gender, multiple genders,\nor neither gender.” Id ., at 349a–350a. The discussion guide\nexplains that “Kate prefers the pronouns they/their/them” and asks\n“ What pronouns fit you best? ” Id ., at 350a (boldface\nin original). Prince & Knight tells the story of a\ncoming-of-age prince whose parents wish to match him with “a kind\nand worthy bride.” Id ., at 397a. After meeting with “many\nladies,” the prince tells his parents that he is “ ‘looking\nfor something different in a partner by [his] side.’ ” Id ., at 398a, 400a. Later in the book, the prince falls into\nthe “embrace” of a knight after the two finish battling a fearsome\ndragon. Id ., at 415a. After the knight takes off his helmet,\nthe prince and knight “gaz[e] into each other’s eyes, [and] their\nhearts beg[in] to race.” Id ., at 418a–419a. The whole\nkingdom later applauds “on the two men’s wedding day.” Id .,\nat 424a. Love Violet follows a young girl named Violet\nwho has a crush on her female classmate, Mira. Mira makes Violet’s\n“heart skip” and “thunde[r] like a hundred galloping horses.” Id ., at 431a, 436a. Although Violet is initially too afraid\nto interact with Mira, the two end up exchanging gifts on\nValentine’s Day. Afterwards, the two girls are seen holding hands\nand “galloping over snowy drifts to see what they might find.\nTogether.” Id ., at 446a. Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named\nPenelope tells the story of Penelope, a child who is initially\ntreated as a girl. The story is told from the perspective of\nPenelope, who at one point says “If they’d all stop and listen, I’d\ntell them about me. Inside I’m a boy.” Id ., at 454a. When\nPenelope’s mother later assures her that “ ‘If you feel like a\nboy, that’s okay,’ ” Penelope responds: “ ‘No, Mama, I\ndon’t feel like a boy. I AM a boy.’ ” Id ., at\n458a. Penelope tells her mother: “ ‘I love you, Mama, but I don’t want\nto be you. I want to be Papa. I don’t want tomorrow to come\nbecause tomorrow I’ll look like you. Please help me, Mama. Help me\nto be a boy.’ ” Id. , at 459a. Penelope’s mother then agrees that she is a boy,\nand Penelope says: “For the first time, my insides don’t feel like\nfire. They feel like warm, golden love.” Id ., at 462a.\nLater, after the family starts treating Penelope as a boy,\nPenelope’s brother complains that “ ‘You can’t become a\nboy. You have to be born one.’ ” Id ., at 465a. This\ncomment draws a rebuke from Penelope’s mother: “ ‘Not\neverything needs to make sense. This is about\nlove .’ ” Ibid . Finally, Uncle Bobby’s Wedding tells the story\nof a young girl named Chloe who is informed that her favorite\nuncle, Bobby, will be getting married to his boyfriend, Jamie. When\nBobby and Jamie announce their engagement, everyone is jubilant\n“except . . . Chloe.” Id ., at 287a. Chloe says\nthat she does not “ ‘understand’ ” why her uncle is\ngetting married, but her mother responds by explaining:\n“ ‘When grown-up people love each other that much, sometimes\nthey get married.’ ” Id ., at 288a. The Board suggested “that teachers incorporate\nthe new texts into the curriculum in the same way that other books\nare used, namely, to put them on a shelf for students to find on\ntheir own; to recommend a book to a student who would enjoy it; to\noffer the books as an option for literature circles, book clubs, or\npaired reading groups; or to use them as a read aloud.” Id .,\nat 604a–605a. And “[a]s with all curriculum resources,” the Board\nvoiced its “expectation that teachers use the LGBTQ-Inclusive Books\nas part of instruction.” Id ., at 605a. An MCPS official has\nmade clear that “[t]eachers cannot . . . elect not to use\nthe LGBTQ-Inclusive Books at all.” Ibid. The Board also contemplated that instruction\ninvolving the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks would include classroom\ndiscussion. See id ., at 642a (Board’s lawyer: “there will be\ndiscussion that ensues. In fact, I think everyone would hope that\ndiscussion ensues”). In anticipation of such discussion, the Board\nhosted a “professional development workshop” in the summer of 2022,\nwhere it provided teachers with a guidance document suggesting how\nthey might respond to student inquiries regarding the themes\npresented in the books. Id ., at 273a–276a, 604a, 628a–635a.\nFor example, if a student asserts that two men cannot get married,\nthe guidance document encouraged teachers to respond by saying:\n“When people are adults they can get married. Two men who love each\nother can decide they want to get married.” Id ., at 628a. If\na student claims that a character “can’t be a boy if he was born a\ngirl,” teachers were encouraged to respond: “That comment is\nhurtful.” Id ., at 630a. And if a student asks “[w]hat’s\ntransgender?”, it was recommended that teachers explain: “When\nwe’re born, people make a guess about our gender and label us ‘boy’\nor ‘girl’ based on our body parts. Sometimes they’re right and\nsometimes they’re wrong.” Ibid . The guidance document\nencouraged teachers to “[d]isrupt the either/or thinking” of their\nstudents. Id ., at 629a, 633a. At the same workshop, the Board also provided\nteachers with a guidance document that suggested particular\nresponses to inquiries by parents. For example, if a parent were to\nask whether the school was attempting to teach a child to “reject”\nthe values taught at home, teachers were encouraged to respond that\n“[t]eaching about LGBTQ+ is not about making students think a\ncertain way; it is to show that there is no one ‘right’ or ‘normal’\nway to be.” Id ., at 638a. The guidance also urged teachers\nto assure parents that there would not be “explicit instruction”\nabout gender and sexual identity, but that “there may be a need to\ndefine words that are new and unfamiliar to students,” and that\n“questions and conversations might organically happen.” Id .,\nat 640a. If parents were not comforted by that information,\nteachers could tell them that “[p]arents always have the choice to\nkeep their student(s) home while using these texts; however, it\nwill not be an excused absence.” Ibid. 2 The Board officially launched the\n“LGBTQ+-inclusive” texts into MCPS schools in the 2022–2023 school\nyear. Shortly thereafter, parents “began contacting individual\nteachers, principals, or MCPS staff ” about the storybooks and\nasking that their children be excused from classroom instruction\nrelated to them. Id ., at 606a. Some parents showed up at the\nBoard’s public business meetings to express their concerns about\nthe storybooks’ content. In an early 2023 meeting, for example, one\nparent represented herself as “a voice for parents in [her]\ncommunity, many of [whom] are actually working today and unable to\nattend.” See MCPS, Jan. 12, 2023, Business Meeting, at 27:15–27:20,\nhttps://mcpsmd.new.swagit.com/videos/196679. She said that MCPS\nparents were “frustrated” because, in their view, “educators and\nadministrators are going behind what [parents] are teaching their\nkids at home, and pushing ideas of gender ideology on their kids.” Id ., at 27:21–27:30. The parent felt that the Board was\n“implying to [children] that their religion, their belief system,\nand their family tradition is actually wrong.” Id ., at\n28:25–28:30. At the same Board meeting, one Board member\nresponded by saying that “some of the testimony today was\ndisturbing to me personally. Transgender, LGBTQ individuals are not\nan ideology, they are a reality. . . . [T]here are\nreligions out there that teach that women should only achieve\ncertain subservient roles in life, and MCPS would never think of\nnot having a book in a classroom that showed a woman” in a\nprofessional role. Id ., at 38:35–39:00. The Board’s student\nmember agreed with the sentiment and proclaimed that “ignorance and\nhate does exist within our community, but please know that every\nstudent—each of our 160,000 students in our large county—has a\nplace in the school system.” Id ., at 40:25–40:36. Initially, the Board compromised with objecting\nparents by notifying them when the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks\nwould be taught and permitting their children to be excused from\ninstruction involving the books. That policy was consistent with\nthe Board’s general “Guidelines for Respecting Religious\nDiversity,” which at the time provided that “[w]hen possible,\nschools should try to make reasonable and feasible adjustments to\nthe instructional program to accommodate requests from students, or\nrequests from parents/guardians on behalf of their students, to be\nexcused from specific classroom discussions or activities that they\nbelieve would impose a substantial burden on their religious\nbeliefs.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 220a–221a. This compromise, however, did not last long. In\nMarch 2023, less than a year after the “LGBTQ+-inclusive” texts\nwere introduced, the Board issued a statement declaring that\n“[s]tudents and families may not choose to opt out of engaging”\nwith the storybooks and that “teachers will not send home letters\nto inform families when inclusive books are read in the future.” Id ., at 657a. According to one MCPS official, the Board\ndecided to change its policy because, among other things,\n“individual principals and teachers could not accommodate the\ngrowing number of opt out requests without causing significant\ndisruptions to the classroom environment.” Id ., at 607a. The\nofficial also stated that permitting some students to exit the\nclassroom while the storybooks were being taught would expose other\nstudents “to social stigma and isolation.” Id ., at 608a. It\nwas therefore announced that any existing accommodations would\nexpire at the end of the 2022–2023 school year. Shortly after the Board rescinded parental opt\nouts, more than 1,000 parents signed a petition asking the Board to\nrestore opt out rights. See Brief for Petitioners 14. And hundreds\nof displeased parents, including many Muslim and Ethiopian Orthodox\nparents, appeared at the Board’s public meetings and implored the\nBoard to allow opt outs. Id ., at 14–15. At a May 2023\nmeeting, one community member testified that “thousands” of parents\nfelt “deeply dismayed and betrayed” by the rescission of opt outs\nfrom “content that conflict[s] with their sincerely held religious\nbeliefs.” MCPS, May 25, 2023, Business Meeting, at 35:33–35:44,\nhttps://mcpsmd.new.swagit.com/videos/‌232766. At the same meeting,\nan MCPS student testified and asked the Board “to allow students\nlike me to opt out of content and books that contain sensitive and\nmature topics that go against my religious beliefs.” Id ., at\n40:47–40:56. The Board was unmoved. After the testimony,\nseveral Board members and another MCPS official spoke up to\n“clarify” that the storybooks would not be used for explicit\ninstruction on sexuality and gender, but rather as part of the\n“literacy curriculum.” Id ., at 1:11:14–1:16:22. According to\na later news article, one Board member recalled that “she felt\n‘kind of sorry’ ” for the student who testified in favor of",

    "fulltext": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus UNITED STATES v . SKRMETTI, ATTORNEY\nGENERAL AND REPORTER FOR TENNESSEE, et al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the sixth circuit No. 23–477. Argued December 4, 2024—Decided\nJune 18, 2025 In 2023, Tennessee joined the growing number\nof States restricting sex transition treatments for minors by\nenacting the Prohibition on Medical Procedures Performed on Minors\nRelated to Sexual Identity, Senate Bill 1 (SB1). SB1 prohibits\nhealthcare providers from prescribing, administering, or dispensing\npuberty blockers or hormones to any minor for the purpose of (1)\nenabling the minor to identify with, or live as, a purported\nidentity inconsistent with the minor’s biological sex, or (2)\ntreating purported discomfort or distress from a discordance\nbetween the minor’s biological sex and asserted identity. At the\nsame time, SB1 permits a healthcare provider to administer puberty\nblockers or hormones to treat a minor’s congenital defect,\nprecocious puberty, disease, or physical injury. Three transgender minors, their parents, and a\ndoctor challenged SB1 under the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. The District Court partially enjoined SB1,\nfinding that transgender individuals constitute a quasi-suspect\nclass, that SB1 discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender\nstatus, and that SB1 was unlikely to survive intermediate scrutiny.\nThe Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the law did not trigger\nheightened scrutiny and satisfied rational basis review. This Court\ngranted certiorari to decide whether SB1 violates the Equal\nProtection Clause. Held : Tennessee’s law prohibiting\ncertain medical treatments for transgender minors is not subject to\nheightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment and satisfies rational basis review.\nPp. 8–24. (a) SB1 is not subject to heightened\nscrutiny because it does not classify on any bases that warrant\nheightened review. Pp. 9–21. (1) On its face, SB1 incorporates two\nclassifications: one based on age (allowing certain medical\ntreatments for adults but not minors) and another based on medical\nuse (permitting puberty blockers and hormones for minors to treat\ncertain conditions but not to treat gender dysphoria, gender\nidentity disorder, or gender incongruence). Classifications based\non age or medical use are subject to only rational basis review.\nSee Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia , 427 U.S.\n307 ( per curiam ); Vacco v. Quill , 521 U.S.\n793 . The plaintiffs argue that SB1 warrants\nheightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.\nBut neither of the above classifications turns on sex. Rather, SB1\nprohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers\nor hormones to minors for certain medical uses ,\nregardless of a minor’s sex. While SB1’s prohibitions reference\nsex, the Court has never suggested that mere reference to sex is\nsufficient to trigger heightened scrutiny. And such an approach\nwould be especially inappropriate in the medical context, where\nsome treatments and procedures are uniquely bound up in sex. The application of SB1, moreover, does not\nturn on sex. The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments\nfor minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for\nminors of the opposite sex. SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from\nadministering puberty blockers or hormones to any minor to treat\ngender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence,\nregardless of the minor’s sex; it permits providers to administer\npuberty blockers and hormones to minors of any sex for other\npurposes. And, while a State may not circumvent the Equal\nProtection Clause by writing in abstract terms, SB1 does not mask\nsex-based classifications. Finally, the Court rejects the plaintiffs’\nargument that, by design, SB1 enforces a government preference that\npeople conform to expectations about their sex. To start, any\nallegations of sex stereotyping are misplaced. True, a law that\nclassifies on the basis of sex may fail heightened scrutiny if the\nclassifications rest on impermissible stereotypes. But where a\nlaw’s classifications are neither covertly nor overtly based on\nsex, the law does not trigger heightened review unless it was\nmotivated by an invidious discriminatory purpose. No such argument\nhas been raised here. And regardless, the statutory findings on\nwhich SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based\nstereotyping. Pp. 9–16. (2) SB1 also does not classify on the\nbasis of transgender status. The Court has explained that a State\ndoes not trigger heightened constitutional scrutiny by regulating a\nmedical procedure that only one sex can undergo unless the\nregulation is a mere pretext for invidious sex discrimination. In Geduldig v. Aiello , 417 U.S.\n484 , the Court held that a California insurance program that\nexcluded from coverage certain disabilities resulting from\npregnancy did not discriminate on the basis of sex. See id .,\nat 486, 492–497. In reaching that holding, the Court explained that\nthe program did not exclude any individual from benefit eligibility\nbecause of the individual’s sex but rather “remove[d] one physical\ncondition—pregnancy—from the list of compensable disabilities.” Id ., at 496, n. 20. The California insurance program,\nthe Court explained, divided potential recipients into two groups:\n“pregnant women and nonpregnant persons.” Ibid . Because\nwomen fell into both groups, the Court reasoned, the program did\nnot discriminate against women as a class. See id ., at 496,\nand n. 20. The Court concluded that, even though only\nbiological women can become pregnant, not every legislative\nclassification concerning pregnancy is a sex-based classification. Id ., at 496, n. 20. As such, “[a]bsent a showing that\ndistinctions involving pregnancy are mere pretexts designed to\neffect an invidious discrimination against the members of one sex\nor the other, lawmakers are constitutionally free to include or\nexclude pregnancy from the coverage of legislation . . .\non any reasonable basis, just as with respect to any other physical\ncondition.” Id ., at 496–497, n. 20. By the same token, SB1 does not exclude any\nindividual from medical treatments on the basis of transgender\nstatus. Rather, it removes one set of diagnoses—gender dysphoria,\ngender identity disorder, and gender incongruence—from the range of\ntreatable conditions. SB1 divides minors into two groups: those\nseeking puberty blockers or hormones to treat the excluded\ndiagnoses, and those seeking puberty blockers or hormones to treat\nother conditions. While the first group includes only transgender\nindividuals, the second encompasses both transgender and\nnontransgender individuals. Thus, although only transgender\nindividuals seek treatment for gender dysphoria, gender identity\ndisorder, and gender incongruence—just as only biological women can\nbecome pregnant—there is a “lack of identity” between transgender\nstatus and the excluded diagnoses. Absent a showing that SB1’s\nprohibitions are pretexts designed to effect invidious\ndiscrimination against transgender individuals, the law does not\nclassify on the basis of transgender status. Pp. 16–18. (3) Finally, Bostock v. Clayton\nCounty , 590 U.S. 644, does not alter the Court’s analysis. In Bostock , the Court held that an employer who fires an\nemployee for being gay or transgender violates Title VII’s\nprohibition on discharging an individual “because of” their sex.\nSee id. , at 650–652, 654–659. The Court reasoned that Title\nVII’s “because of” test incorporates the traditional but-for\ncausation standard, which directs courts “to change one thing at a\ntime and see if the outcome changes.” Id ., at 656. Applying\nthat test, the Court held that, “[f]or an employer to discriminate\nagainst employees for being homosexual or transgender, the employer\nmust intentionally discriminate against individual men and women in\npart because of sex.” Id ., at 662. In such a case, the\nemployer has penalized a member of one sex for a trait or action\nthat it tolerates in members of the other. The Court declines to address whether Bostock ’s reasoning reaches beyond the Title VII\ncontext—unlike the employment discrimination at issue in Bostock , changing a minor’s sex or transgender status does\nnot alter the application of SB1. If a transgender boy seeks\ntestosterone to treat gender dysphoria, SB1 prevents a healthcare\nprovider from administering it to him. If his biological sex were\nchanged from female to male, SB1 would still not permit him the\nhormones he seeks because he would lack a qualifying diagnosis. The\ntransgender boy could receive testosterone only if he had a\npermissible diagnosis (like a congenital defect). And, if he had\nsuch a diagnosis, he could obtain the testosterone regardless of\nhis sex or transgender status. Under the reasoning of Bostock , neither his sex nor his transgender status is the\nbut-for cause of his inability to obtain testosterone.\nPp. 18–21. (b) SB1 satisfies rational basis review.\nUnder that standard, the Court will uphold a statutory\nclassification so long as there is “any reasonably conceivable\nstate of facts that could provide a rational basis for the\nclassification.” FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc. , 508 U.S.\n307 , 313. SB1 clearly meets that standard of review. Tennessee\ndetermined that administering puberty blockers or hormones to\nminors to treat gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or\ngender incongruence carries risks, including irreversible\nsterility, increased risk of disease and illness, and adverse\npsychological consequences. The legislature found that minors lack\nthe maturity to fully understand these consequences, that many\nindividuals have expressed regret for undergoing such treatments as\nminors, and that the full effects of such treatments may not yet be\nknown. At the same time, the State noted evidence that discordance\nbetween sex and gender can be resolved through less invasive\napproaches. SB1’s age- and diagnosis-based classifications are\nrationally related to these findings and the State’s objective of\nprotecting minors’ health and welfare. The Court also declines the plaintiffs’\ninvitation to second-guess the lines that SB1 draws. States have\n“wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is\nmedical and scientific uncertainty.” Gonzales v. Carhart , 550 U.S.\n124 , 163. Recent developments demonstrate the open questions\nthat exist regarding basic factual issues before medical\nauthorities and regulatory bodies in this area, underscoring the\nneed for legislative flexibility. Pp. 21–24. (c) This case carries with it the weight\nof fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy,\nand propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The Equal\nProtection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. The Court’s\nrole is not “to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic” of SB1, Beach Communications , 508 U. S., at 313, but only to\nensure that the law does not violate equal protection guarantees.\nIt does not. Questions regarding the law’s policy are thus\nappropriately left to the people, their elected representatives,\nand the democratic process. P. 24. 83 F. 4th 460, affirmed.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 23–477 _________________ UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. JONATHAN\nSKRMETTI, ATTORNEY GENERAL AND REPORTER FOR TENNESSEE,\net al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit [June 18, 2025] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. In this case, we consider whether a Tennessee\nlaw banning certain medical care for transgender minors violates\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. I A An estimated 1.6 million Americans over the\nage of 13 identify as transgender, meaning that their gender\nidentity does not align with their biological sex. See 1 App.\n257–259; 2 id ., at 827. Some transgender individuals suffer\nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition characterized by\npersistent, clinically significant distress resulting from an\nincongruence between gender identity and biological sex. Left\nuntreated, gender dysphoria may result in severe physical and\npsychological harms. In 1979, the World Professional Association for\nTransgender Health (WPATH) (then known as the Harry Benjamin\nInternational Gender Dysphoria Association) published one of the\nfirst sets of clinical guidelines for treating gender dysphoria\nwith sex transition treatments. See P. Walker et al.,\nStandards of Care: The Hormonal and Surgical Sex Reassignment of\nGender Dysphoric Persons (1979), reprinted in 14 Archives of Sexual\nBehavior 79 (1985). The standards addressed two treatments in\nparticular: hormonal sex reassignment (the use of hormones to\ninduce the development of physical characteristics of the opposite\nsex) and surgical sex reassignment (surgery of the genitalia and/or\nchest to approximate the physical appearance of the opposite sex).\nSee id ., at 81, §§3.2–3.3. They recognized the extensive and\nsometimes irreversible consequences of hormonal therapy and sex\nreassignment surgery and acknowledged that some individuals who\nundergo reassignment procedures later regret their decision to do\nso. See id ., at 83, 85–86, §§4.1.1–4.1.3, 4.4.2–4.4.3,\n4.5.1. Among other things, the standards of care provided that\nhormonal and surgical sex reassignment treatments should be\nadministered only to adults. See id ., at 89, §4.14.4. In 1998, WPATH revised its standards of care to\npermit healthcare professionals to administer puberty blockers\n(designed to delay the development of physical sex characteristics)\nand hormones to minors in “rar[e]” circumstances. S. Levine\net al., The Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disorders\n(5th ed. 1998), reprinted in 11 J. Psychology & Human Sexuality\n1, 20 (1999). Today, the standards discuss a range of factors\nregarding the provision of such treatments to minors. E. Coleman\net al., Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and\nGender Diverse People, Version 8, 23 Int’l J. Transgender Health\nS1, S65–S66 (2022). The current standards recognize known risks\nassociated with the provision of sex transition treatments to\nadolescents, including potential adverse effects on fertility and\nthe possibility that an adolescent will later wish to detransition.\nSee id ., at S47, S57, S61–S62. They further state that there\nis “limited data on the optimal timing” of sex transition\ntreatments or “the long-term physical, psychological, and\nneurodevelopmental outcomes in youth,” id ., at S65, and note\nthat “[o]ur understanding of gender identity development in\nadolescence is continuing to evolve,” id ., at S44. In recent years, the number of minors requesting\nsex transition treatments has increased. See 2 App. 644, 827–828.\nThis increase has corresponded with rising debates regarding the\nrelative risks and benefits of such treatments. Compare, e . g ., Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 1–13, with Brief for Alabama as Amicus\nCuriae 1–9. In the last three years, more than 20 States have\nenacted laws banning the provision of sex transition treatments to\nminors, while two have enacted near total bans. Meanwhile, health authorities in a number of\nEuropean countries have raised significant concerns regarding the\npotential harms associated with using puberty blockers and hormones\nto treat transgender minors. In 2020, Finland’s Council for Choices\nin Health Care found that “gender reassignment of minors is an\nexperimental practice” and that “the reliability of the existing\nstudies” is “highly uncertain.” 2 App. 583–584 (alterations\nomitted); see id ., at 715–722, 727–729. That same year,\nEngland’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\npublished reports finding that the evidence for using puberty\nblockers to treat transgender adolescents is of “very low\ncertainty” and that the long-term risks associated with using\nhormones to treat adolescents with gender dysphoria are “largely\nunknown.” Id ., at 588–589. In 2022, Sweden’s National Board\nof Health and Welfare found that “the evidence on treatment\nefficacy and safety is still insufficient and inconclusive” and\nthat the “risks” of puberty blockers and hormones “currently\noutweigh the possible benefits.” 1 id ., at 339–340; see 2 id ., at 584–587. And in 2023, the Norwegian Healthcare\nInvestigation Board concluded that the “research-based knowledge”\nfor hormonal sex transition treatments for minors is\n“insufficient,” while the “long-term effects are little known.” 1 id ., at 341–342. B In March 2023, Tennessee joined the growing\nnumber of States restricting sex transition treatments for minors\nby enacting the Prohibition on Medical Procedures Performed on\nMinors Related to Sexual Identity, S. B. 1, 113th Gen. Assem., 1st\nExtra. Sess.; Tenn. Code Ann. §68–33–101 et seq. (SB1).\nWhile the State’s legislature acknowledged that discordance between\na minor’s gender identity and biological sex can cause “discomfort\nor distress,” §68–33–101(c), it identified concerns regarding the\nuse of puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria in\nminors. In particular, the legislature found that such treatments\n“can lead to the minor becoming irreversibly sterile, having\nincreased risk of disease and illness, or suffering from adverse\nand sometimes fatal psychological consequences,” §68–33–101(b), and\nthat minors “lack the maturity to fully understand and appreciate”\nthese consequences and may later regret undergoing the treatments,\n§68–33–101(h). The legislature further found that sex transition\ntreatments were “being performed on and administered to minors in\nth[e] state with rapidly increasing frequency,” §68–33–101(g),\nnotwithstanding the fact that the full range of harmful effects\nassociated with the treatments were likely not yet known, see\n§68–33–101(b). The legislature also noted that guidelines regarding\nsex transition treatments for minors had “changed substantially in\nrecent years,” §68–33–101(g), and that health authorities in\nSweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom had “placed severe\nrestrictions” on such treatments after determining that there was\n“no evidence” that their benefits outweigh their risks,\n§68–33–101(e); see supra , at 3. Finally, the legislature\ndetermined that there is evidence that gender dysphoria “can be\nresolved by less invasive approaches that are likely to result in\nbetter outcomes.” §68–33–101(c). SB1 responds to these concerns by banning the\nuse of certain medical procedures for treating transgender minors.\nIn particular, the law prohibits a healthcare provider from\n“[s]urgically removing, modifying, altering, or entering into\ntissues, cavities, or organs of a human being,” or “[p]rescribing,\nadministering, or dispensing any puberty blocker or hormone,”\n§68–33–102(5), for the purpose of (1) “[e]nabling a minor to\nidentify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with\nthe minor’s sex,” or (2) “[t]reating purported discomfort or\ndistress from a discordance between the minor’s sex and asserted\nidentity,” §68–33–103(a)(1). Among other things, these prohibitions\nare intended to “protec[t] minors from physical and emotional harm”\nby “encouraging minors to appreciate,” rather than “become\ndisdainful of,” their sex. §68–33–101(m). SB1 is limited in two relevant ways. First, SB1\ndoes not restrict the administration of puberty blockers or\nhormones to individuals 18 and over. §68–33–102(6). Second, SB1\ndoes not ban fully the administration of such drugs to minors. A\nhealthcare provider may administer puberty blockers or hormones to\ntreat a minor’s congenital defect, precocious (or early) puberty,\ndisease, or physical injury. §68–33–103(b)(1)(A). The law defines\nthe term “[c]ongenital defect” to include an “abnormality present\nin a minor that is inconsistent with the normal development of a\nhuman being of the minor’s sex,” §68–33–102(1), but excludes from\nthe definitions of “[c]ongenital defect” and “disease” “gender\ndysphoria, gender identity disorder, [and] gender incongruence,”\n§§68–33–102(1), 68–33–103(b)(2). SB1 contains three primary enforcement\nmechanisms. The law authorizes Tennessee’s attorney general to\nbring against any person who knowingly violates SB1 an action “to\nenjoin further violations, to disgorge any profits received due to\nthe medical procedure, and to recover a civil penalty of [$25,000]\nper violation.” §68–33–106(b). SB1 further permits the relevant\nstate regulatory authorities to discipline healthcare providers who\nviolate the law’s prohibitions. §68–33–107. Finally, SB1 creates a\nprivate right of action that enables an injured minor or\nnonconsenting parent of an injured minor to sue a healthcare\nprovider for violating the law. §68–33–105. C Three transgender minors, their parents, and a\ndoctor (plaintiffs) brought a pre-enforcement challenge to SB1.\nAmong other things, the plaintiffs asserted that SB1 violates the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They moved for\na preliminary injunction preventing the law’s bans on sex\ntransition treatments for minors from going into effect. The United\nStates intervened under 42 U. S. C. §2000h–2, which\nauthorizes the Federal Government to intervene in a private equal\nprotection suit “if the Attorney General certifies that the case is\nof general public importance.” See Memorandum Opinion and Order in\nNo. 23–cv–00376 (MD Tenn., May 16, 2023), ECF Doc. 108. The District Court partially enjoined\nenforcement of SB1’s prohibitions. See L. W. v. Skrmetti , 679 F. Supp. 3d 668, 677 (MD Tenn. 2023). The\ncourt concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge\nthe law’s ban on sex transition surgery for minors. Id ., at\n681–682. But the court held, as relevant, that the United States\nand plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their equal protection\nchallenge to the law’s prohibitions on puberty blockers and\nhormones. Id ., at 682–712. The court found that transgender\nindividuals constitute a quasi-suspect class, that SB1\ndiscriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status, and that\nSB1 was unlikely to survive intermediate scrutiny. Id ., at\n686–687, 698, 712. Having concluded that SB1 was likely\nunconstitutional on its face, the District Court issued a statewide\ninjunction enjoining enforcement of all provisions of SB1 except\nfor the private right of action and the law’s ban on sex transition\nsurgery. See id ., at 680–681, 716–718. Tennessee appealed,\nand the Sixth Circuit stayed the preliminary injunction pending\nappeal. L. W. v. Skrmetti , 83 F. 4th 460, 469\n(CA6 2023). The Sixth Circuit reversed. As relevant, the\nSixth Circuit held that the United States and plaintiffs were\nunlikely to succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim.\nSee id ., at 479–489. The court first found that SB1 does not\nclassify on the basis of sex because the law “regulate[s]\nsex-transition treatments for all minors, regardless of sex,” by\nprohibiting all minors from “receiv[ing] puberty blockers or\nhormones or surgery in order to transition from one sex to\nanother.” Id ., at 480. The court next declined to recognize\ntransgender individuals as a suspect class, finding that\ntransgender individuals are neither politically powerless nor a\ndiscrete group defined by obvious, immutable, or distinguishing\ncharacteristics. Id ., at 486–487. Finally, the court\nconcluded that the United States and plaintiffs had failed to\nestablish that animus toward transgender individuals as a class was\nthe operative force behind SB1. See id ., at 487–488. The\nSixth Circuit held that SB1 was subject to and survived rational\nbasis review, finding that Tennessee had offered “considerable\nevidence” regarding the risks associated with the banned medical\ntreatments and the flaws in existing research. Id ., at\n489. Judge White dissented. Judge White would have\nheld that the United States and plaintiffs were likely to succeed\non the merits of their equal protection claim. Id ., at 498.\nIn her view, SB1 triggered heightened scrutiny because it “facially\ndiscriminate[s] based on a minor’s sex as assigned at birth and on\na minor’s failure to conform with societal expectations concerning\nthat sex.” Ibid . Judge White would have held that Tennessee\nhad failed to “show an exceeding[ly] persuasive justification or\nclose means-ends fit” for the law’s sex-based classifications. Ibid. We granted certiorari to decide whether SB1\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.[ 1 ] 602 U. S.\n___ (2024). II The Fourteenth Amendment’s command that no\nState shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\nprotection of the laws,” U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1, “must\ncoexist with the practical necessity that most legislation\nclassifies for one purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage\nto various groups or persons,” Romer v. Evans , 517 U.S.\n620 , 631 (1996). We have reconciled the principle of equal\nprotection with the reality of legislative classification by\nholding that, “if a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor\ntargets a suspect class, we will uphold the legislative\nclassification so long as it bears a rational relation to some\nlegitimate end.” Ibid. We generally afford such laws “wide\nlatitude” under this rational basis review, acknowledging that “the\nConstitution presumes that even improvident decisions will\neventually be rectified by the democratic processes.” Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc. , 473 U.S.\n432 , 440 (1985). Certain legislative classifications, however,\nprompt heightened review. For example, laws that classify on the\nbasis of race, alienage, or national origin trigger strict scrutiny\nand will pass constitutional muster “only if they are suitably\ntailored to serve a compelling state interest.” Ibid. We\nhave similarly held that sex-based classifications warrant\nheightened scrutiny. See United States v. Virginia , 518 U.S.\n515 , 533 (1996). While our precedent does not make sex a\n“proscribed classification,” ibid. , we have explained that\nsex “generally provides no sensible ground for differential\ntreatment,” Cleburne , 473 U. S., at 440, and that\nsex-based lines too often reflect stereotypes or overbroad\ngeneralizations about the differences between men and women, see Sessions v. Morales-Santana , 582 U.S. 47, 62 (2017).\nWe accordingly subject laws containing sex-based classifications to\nintermediate scrutiny, under which the State must show that the\n“classification serves important governmental objectives and that\nthe discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the\nachievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533 (internal quotation marks omitted). A We are asked to decide whether SB1 is subject\nto heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. We hold\nit is not. SB1 does not classify on any bases that warrant\nheightened review. 1 On its face, SB1 incorporates two\nclassifications. First, SB1 classifies on the basis of age.\nHealthcare providers may administer certain medical treatments to\nindividuals ages 18 and older but not to minors. Second, SB1\nclassifies on the basis of medical use. Healthcare providers may\nadminister puberty blockers or hormones to minors to treat certain\nconditions but not to treat gender dysphoria, gender identity\ndisorder, or gender incongruence. Classifications that turn on age\nor medical use are subject to only rational basis review. See Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia , 427 U.S.\n307 , 312–314 (1976) ( per curiam ) (rational basis review\napplies to age-based classification); Vacco v. Quill , 521 U.S.\n793 , 799–808 (1997) (state laws outlawing assisted suicide\n“neither infringe fundamental rights nor involve suspect\nclassifications”). The plaintiffs argue that SB1 warrants\nheightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.\nSee Brief for Respondents in Support of Petitioner 20–37. We\ndisagree. Neither of the above classifications turns on\nsex. Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering\npuberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses , regardless of a minor’s sex. Cf. Vacco ,\n521 U. S., at 800 (“On their faces, neither New York’s ban on\nassisting suicide nor its statutes permitting patients to refuse\nmedical treatment treat anyone differently from anyone else or draw\nany distinctions between persons. Everyone , regardless of\nphysical condition, is entitled, if competent, to refuse unwanted\nlifesaving medical treatment; no one is permitted to assist\na suicide.”). The plaintiffs resist this conclusion, arguing\nthat SB1 creates facial sex-based classifications by defining the\nprohibited medical care based on the patient’s sex. See Brief for\nRespondents in Support of Petitioner 22. This argument takes two\nforms. At times, the plaintiffs suggest that SB1 classifies on the\nbasis of sex because its prohibitions reference sex. Alternatively,\nthe plaintiffs contend that SB1 works a sex-based classification\nbecause application of the law turns on sex. Neither argument is\npersuasive. This Court has never suggested that mere\nreference to sex is sufficient to trigger heightened scrutiny. See, e . g ., Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U.S.\n53 , 64 (2001) (“The issue is not the use of gender specific\nterms instead of neutral ones. Just as neutral terms can mask\ndiscrimination that is unlawful, gender specific terms can mark a\npermissible distinction.”). Such an approach, moreover, would be\nespecially inappropriate in the medical context. Some medical\ntreatments and procedures are uniquely bound up in sex. The Food\nand Drug Administration itself recognizes that “[r]esearch has\nshown that biological differences between men and women\n(differences due to sex chromosome or sex hormones) may contribute\nto variations seen in the safety and efficacy of drugs, biologics,\nand medical devices.” FDA, Sex as a Biological Variable (Jan. 30,\n2025) (online source archived at https://www.supremecourt.gov).\nIndeed, the agency frequently approves drugs for use by only one\nsex. See, e . g ., FDA, FDA in Brief: FDA Encourages\nInclusion of Male Patients in Breast Cancer Clinical Trials (Aug.\n26, 2019) (online source archived at https://www.supremecourt .gov)\n(“many” breast cancer treatments approved for women only); FDA, FDA\nApproves Second Drug To Prevent HIV Infection as Part of Ongoing\nEfforts To End the HIV Epidemic (Oct. 3, 2019) (online source\narchived at https://www.supremecourt.gov) (drug to prevent HIV not\napproved for women). In the medical context, the mere use of\nsex-based language does not sweep a statute within the reach of\nheightened scrutiny. We also reject the argument that the application\nof SB1 turns on sex. The plaintiffs and the dissent contend that an\nadolescent whose biological sex is female cannot receive puberty\nblockers or testosterone to live and present as a male, but an\nadolescent whose biological sex is male can, while an adolescent\nwhose biological sex is male cannot receive puberty blockers or\nestrogen to live and present as a female, but an adolescent whose\nbiological sex is female can. See Brief for Respondents in Support\nof Petitioner 22; post , at 10–15 (Sotomayor, J.,\ndissenting). So conceived, they argue, SB1 prohibits certain\ntreatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same\ntreatments for minors of the opposite sex. The plaintiffs and the dissent, however, contort\nthe meaning of the term “medical treatment.” Notably absent from\ntheir framing is a key aspect of any medical treatment: the\nunderlying medical concern the treatment is intended to address.\nThe Food and Drug Administration approves drugs and requires that\nthey be labeled for particular indications—the diseases or\nconditions that they treat, prevent, mitigate, diagnose, or cure.\nSee 21 CFR §§201.57(c)(2), 314.50(a)(1) (2024). Different drugs can\nbe used to treat the same thing (would you like Advil or Tylenol\nfor your headache?), and the same drug can treat ",

SKRMETTI, ATTORNEY\nGENERAL AND REPORTER FOR TENNESSEE, et al. certiorari to the united states court of\nappeals for the sixth circuit No. 23–477. Argued December 4, 2024—Decided\nJune 18, 2025 In 2023, Tennessee joined the growing number\nof States restricting sex transition treatments for minors by\nenacting the Prohibition on Medical Procedures Performed on Minors\nRelated to Sexual Identity, Senate Bill 1 (SB1). SB1 prohibits\nhealthcare providers from prescribing, administering, or dispensing\npuberty blockers or hormones to any minor for the purpose of (1)\nenabling the minor to identify with, or live as, a purported\nidentity inconsistent with the minor’s biological sex, or (2)\ntreating purported discomfort or distress from a discordance\nbetween the minor’s biological sex and asserted identity. At the\nsame time, SB1 permits a healthcare provider to administer puberty\nblockers or hormones to treat a minor’s congenital defect,\nprecocious puberty, disease, or physical injury. Three transgender minors, their parents, and a\ndoctor challenged SB1 under the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment. The District Court partially enjoined SB1,\nfinding that transgender individuals constitute a quasi-suspect\nclass, that SB1 discriminates on the basis of sex and transgender\nstatus, and that SB1 was unlikely to survive intermediate scrutiny.\nThe Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the law did not trigger\nheightened scrutiny and satisfied rational basis review. This Court\ngranted certiorari to decide whether SB1 violates the Equal\nProtection Clause. Held : Tennessee’s law prohibiting\ncertain medical treatments for transgender minors is not subject to\nheightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment and satisfies rational basis review.\nPp. 8–24. (a) SB1 is not subject to heightened\nscrutiny because it does not classify on any bases that warrant\nheightened review. Pp. 9–21. (1) On its face, SB1 incorporates two\nclassifications: one based on age (allowing certain medical\ntreatments for adults but not minors) and another based on medical\nuse (permitting puberty blockers and hormones for minors to treat\ncertain conditions but not to treat gender dysphoria, gender\nidentity disorder, or gender incongruence). Classifications based\non age or medical use are subject to only rational basis review.\nSee Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia , 427 U.S.\n307 ( per curiam ); Vacco v. Quill , 521 U.S.\n793 . The plaintiffs argue that SB1 warrants\nheightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.\nBut neither of the above classifications turns on sex. Rather, SB1\nprohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers\nor hormones to minors for certain medical uses ,\nregardless of a minor’s sex. While SB1’s prohibitions reference\nsex, the Court has never suggested that mere reference to sex is\nsufficient to trigger heightened scrutiny. And such an approach\nwould be especially inappropriate in the medical context, where\nsome treatments and procedures are uniquely bound up in sex. The application of SB1, moreover, does not\nturn on sex. The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments\nfor minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for\nminors of the opposite sex. SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from\nadministering puberty blockers or hormones to any minor to treat\ngender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence,\nregardless of the minor’s sex; it permits providers to administer\npuberty blockers and hormones to minors of any sex for other\npurposes. And, while a State may not circumvent the Equal\nProtection Clause by writing in abstract terms, SB1 does not mask\nsex-based classifications. Finally, the Court rejects the plaintiffs’\nargument that, by design, SB1 enforces a government preference that\npeople conform to expectations about their sex. To start, any\nallegations of sex stereotyping are misplaced. True, a law that\nclassifies on the basis of sex may fail heightened scrutiny if the\nclassifications rest on impermissible stereotypes. But where a\nlaw’s classifications are neither covertly nor overtly based on\nsex, the law does not trigger heightened review unless it was\nmotivated by an invidious discriminatory purpose. No such argument\nhas been raised here. And regardless, the statutory findings on\nwhich SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based\nstereotyping. Pp. 9–16. (2) SB1 also does not classify on the\nbasis of transgender status. The Court has explained that a State\ndoes not trigger heightened constitutional scrutiny by regulating a\nmedical procedure that only one sex can undergo unless the\nregulation is a mere pretext for invidious sex discrimination. In Geduldig v. Aiello , 417 U.S.\n484 , the Court held that a California insurance program that\nexcluded from coverage certain disabilities resulting from\npregnancy did not discriminate on the basis of sex. See id .,\nat 486, 492–497. In reaching that holding, the Court explained that\nthe program did not exclude any individual from benefit eligibility\nbecause of the individual’s sex but rather “remove[d] one physical\ncondition—pregnancy—from the list of compensable disabilities.” Id ., at 496, n. 20. The California insurance program,\nthe Court explained, divided potential recipients into two groups:\n“pregnant women and nonpregnant persons.” Ibid . Because\nwomen fell into both groups, the Court reasoned, the program did\nnot discriminate against women as a class. See id ., at 496,\nand n. 20. The Court concluded that, even though only\nbiological women can become pregnant, not every legislative\nclassification concerning pregnancy is a sex-based classification. Id ., at 496, n. 20. As such, “[a]bsent a showing that\ndistinctions involving pregnancy are mere pretexts designed to\neffect an invidious discrimination against the members of one sex\nor the other, lawmakers are constitutionally free to include or\nexclude pregnancy from the coverage of legislation . . .\non any reasonable basis, just as with respect to any other physical\ncondition.” Id ., at 496–497, n. 20. By the same token, SB1 does not exclude any\nindividual from medical treatments on the basis of transgender\nstatus. Rather, it removes one set of diagnoses—gender dysphoria,\ngender identity disorder, and gender incongruence—from the range of\ntreatable conditions. SB1 divides minors into two groups: those\nseeking puberty blockers or hormones to treat the excluded\ndiagnoses, and those seeking puberty blockers or hormones to treat\nother conditions. While the first group includes only transgender\nindividuals, the second encompasses both transgender and\nnontransgender individuals. Thus, although only transgender\nindividuals seek treatment for gender dysphoria, gender identity\ndisorder, and gender incongruence—just as only biological women can\nbecome pregnant—there is a “lack of identity” between transgender\nstatus and the excluded diagnoses. Absent a showing that SB1’s\nprohibitions are pretexts designed to effect invidious\ndiscrimination against transgender individuals, the law does not\nclassify on the basis of transgender status. Pp. 16–18. (3) Finally, Bostock v. Clayton\nCounty , 590 U.S. 644, does not alter the Court’s analysis. In Bostock , the Court held that an employer who fires an\nemployee for being gay or transgender violates Title VII’s\nprohibition on discharging an individual “because of” their sex.\nSee id. , at 650–652, 654–659. The Court reasoned that Title\nVII’s “because of” test incorporates the traditional but-for\ncausation standard, which directs courts “to change one thing at a\ntime and see if the outcome changes.” Id ., at 656. Applying\nthat test, the Court held that, “[f]or an employer to discriminate\nagainst employees for being homosexual or transgender, the employer\nmust intentionally discriminate against individual men and women in\npart because of sex.” Id ., at 662. In such a case, the\nemployer has penalized a member of one sex for a trait or action\nthat it tolerates in members of the other. The Court declines to address whether Bostock ’s reasoning reaches beyond the Title VII\ncontext—unlike the employment discrimination at issue in Bostock , changing a minor’s sex or transgender status does\nnot alter the application of SB1. If a transgender boy seeks\ntestosterone to treat gender dysphoria, SB1 prevents a healthcare\nprovider from administering it to him. If his biological sex were\nchanged from female to male, SB1 would still not permit him the\nhormones he seeks because he would lack a qualifying diagnosis. The\ntransgender boy could receive testosterone only if he had a\npermissible diagnosis (like a congenital defect). And, if he had\nsuch a diagnosis, he could obtain the testosterone regardless of\nhis sex or transgender status. Under the reasoning of Bostock , neither his sex nor his transgender status is the\nbut-for cause of his inability to obtain testosterone.\nPp. 18–21. (b) SB1 satisfies rational basis review.\nUnder that standard, the Court will uphold a statutory\nclassification so long as there is “any reasonably conceivable\nstate of facts that could provide a rational basis for the\nclassification.” FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc. , 508 U.S.\n307 , 313. SB1 clearly meets that standard of review. Tennessee\ndetermined that administering puberty blockers or hormones to\nminors to treat gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or\ngender incongruence carries risks, including irreversible\nsterility, increased risk of disease and illness, and adverse\npsychological consequences. The legislature found that minors lack\nthe maturity to fully understand these consequences, that many\nindividuals have expressed regret for undergoing such treatments as\nminors, and that the full effects of such treatments may not yet be\nknown. At the same time, the State noted evidence that discordance\nbetween sex and gender can be resolved through less invasive\napproaches. SB1’s age- and diagnosis-based classifications are\nrationally related to these findings and the State’s objective of\nprotecting minors’ health and welfare. The Court also declines the plaintiffs’\ninvitation to second-guess the lines that SB1 draws. States have\n“wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is\nmedical and scientific uncertainty.” Gonzales v. Carhart , 550 U.S.\n124 , 163. Recent developments demonstrate the open questions\nthat exist regarding basic factual issues before medical\nauthorities and regulatory bodies in this area, underscoring the\nneed for legislative flexibility. Pp. 21–24. (c) This case carries with it the weight\nof fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy,\nand propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The Equal\nProtection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. The Court’s\nrole is not “to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic” of SB1, Beach Communications , 508 U. S., at 313, but only to\nensure that the law does not violate equal protection guarantees.\nIt does not. Questions regarding the law’s policy are thus\nappropriately left to the people, their elected representatives,\nand the democratic process. P. 24. 83 F. 4th 460, affirmed. Roberts, C. J., delivered the opinion of\nthe Court, in which Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, JJ.,\njoined, and in which Alito, J., joined as to Parts I and II–B.\nThomas, J., filed a concurring opinion.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 23–477 _________________ UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v. JONATHAN\nSKRMETTI, ATTORNEY GENERAL AND REPORTER FOR TENNESSEE,\net al. on writ of certiorari to the united states\ncourt of appeals for the sixth circuit [June 18, 2025] Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of\nthe Court. In this case, we consider whether a Tennessee\nlaw banning certain medical care for transgender minors violates\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. I A An estimated 1.6 million Americans over the\nage of 13 identify as transgender, meaning that their gender\nidentity does not align with their biological sex. See 1 App.\n257–259; 2 id ., at 827. Some transgender individuals suffer\nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition characterized by\npersistent, clinically significant distress resulting from an\nincongruence between gender identity and biological sex. Left\nuntreated, gender dysphoria may result in severe physical and\npsychological harms. In 1979, the World Professional Association for\nTransgender Health (WPATH) (then known as the Harry Benjamin\nInternational Gender Dysphoria Association) published one of the\nfirst sets of clinical guidelines for treating gender dysphoria\nwith sex transition treatments. See P. Walker et al.,\nStandards of Care: The Hormonal and Surgical Sex Reassignment of\nGender Dysphoric Persons (1979), reprinted in 14 Archives of Sexual\nBehavior 79 (1985). The standards addressed two treatments in\nparticular: hormonal sex reassignment (the use of hormones to\ninduce the development of physical characteristics of the opposite\nsex) and surgical sex reassignment (surgery of the genitalia and/or\nchest to approximate the physical appearance of the opposite sex).\nSee id ., at 81, §§3.2–3.3. They recognized the extensive and\nsometimes irreversible consequences of hormonal therapy and sex\nreassignment surgery and acknowledged that some individuals who\nundergo reassignment procedures later regret their decision to do\nso. See id ., at 83, 85–86, §§4.1.1–4.1.3, 4.4.2–4.4.3,\n4.5.1. Among other things, the standards of care provided that\nhormonal and surgical sex reassignment treatments should be\nadministered only to adults. See id ., at 89, §4.14.4. In 1998, WPATH revised its standards of care to\npermit healthcare professionals to administer puberty blockers\n(designed to delay the development of physical sex characteristics)\nand hormones to minors in “rar[e]” circumstances. S. Levine\net al., The Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disorders\n(5th ed. 1998), reprinted in 11 J. Psychology & Human Sexuality\n1, 20 (1999). Today, the standards discuss a range of factors\nregarding the provision of such treatments to minors. E. Coleman\net al., Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and\nGender Diverse People, Version 8, 23 Int’l J. Transgender Health\nS1, S65–S66 (2022). The current standards recognize known risks\nassociated with the provision of sex transition treatments to\nadolescents, including potential adverse effects on fertility and\nthe possibility that an adolescent will later wish to detransition.\nSee id ., at S47, S57, S61–S62. They further state that there\nis “limited data on the optimal timing” of sex transition\ntreatments or “the long-term physical, psychological, and\nneurodevelopmental outcomes in youth,” id ., at S65, and note\nthat “[o]ur understanding of gender identity development in\nadolescence is continuing to evolve,” id ., at S44. In recent years, the number of minors requesting\nsex transition treatments has increased. See 2 App. 644, 827–828.\nThis increase has corresponded with rising debates regarding the\nrelative risks and benefits of such treatments. Compare, e . g ., Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 1–13, with Brief for Alabama as Amicus\nCuriae 1–9. In the last three years, more than 20 States have\nenacted laws banning the provision of sex transition treatments to\nminors, while two have enacted near total bans. Meanwhile, health authorities in a number of\nEuropean countries have raised significant concerns regarding the\npotential harms associated with using puberty blockers and hormones\nto treat transgender minors. In 2020, Finland’s Council for Choices\nin Health Care found that “gender reassignment of minors is an\nexperimental practice” and that “the reliability of the existing\nstudies” is “highly uncertain.” 2 App. 583–584 (alterations\nomitted); see id ., at 715–722, 727–729. That same year,\nEngland’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\npublished reports finding that the evidence for using puberty\nblockers to treat transgender adolescents is of “very low\ncertainty” and that the long-term risks associated with using\nhormones to treat adolescents with gender dysphoria are “largely\nunknown.” Id ., at 588–589. In 2022, Sweden’s National Board\nof Health and Welfare found that “the evidence on treatment\nefficacy and safety is still insufficient and inconclusive” and\nthat the “risks” of puberty blockers and hormones “currently\noutweigh the possible benefits.” 1 id ., at 339–340; see 2 id ., at 584–587. And in 2023, the Norwegian Healthcare\nInvestigation Board concluded that the “research-based knowledge”\nfor hormonal sex transition treatments for minors is\n“insufficient,” while the “long-term effects are little known.” 1 id ., at 341–342. B In March 2023, Tennessee joined the growing\nnumber of States restricting sex transition treatments for minors\nby enacting the Prohibition on Medical Procedures Performed on\nMinors Related to Sexual Identity, S. B. 1, 113th Gen. Assem., 1st\nExtra. Sess.; Tenn. Code Ann. §68–33–101 et seq. (SB1).\nWhile the State’s legislature acknowledged that discordance between\na minor’s gender identity and biological sex can cause “discomfort\nor distress,” §68–33–101(c), it identified concerns regarding the\nuse of puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria in\nminors. In particular, the legislature found that such treatments\n“can lead to the minor becoming irreversibly sterile, having\nincreased risk of disease and illness, or suffering from adverse\nand sometimes fatal psychological consequences,” §68–33–101(b), and\nthat minors “lack the maturity to fully understand and appreciate”\nthese consequences and may later regret undergoing the treatments,\n§68–33–101(h). The legislature further found that sex transition\ntreatments were “being performed on and administered to minors in\nth[e] state with rapidly increasing frequency,” §68–33–101(g),\nnotwithstanding the fact that the full range of harmful effects\nassociated with the treatments were likely not yet known, see\n§68–33–101(b). The legislature also noted that guidelines regarding\nsex transition treatments for minors had “changed substantially in\nrecent years,” §68–33–101(g), and that health authorities in\nSweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom had “placed severe\nrestrictions” on such treatments after determining that there was\n“no evidence” that their benefits outweigh their risks,\n§68–33–101(e); see supra , at 3. Finally, the legislature\ndetermined that there is evidence that gender dysphoria “can be\nresolved by less invasive approaches that are likely to result in\nbetter outcomes.” §68–33–101(c). SB1 responds to these concerns by banning the\nuse of certain medical procedures for treating transgender minors.\nIn particular, the law prohibits a healthcare provider from\n“[s]urgically removing, modifying, altering, or entering into\ntissues, cavities, or organs of a human being,” or “[p]rescribing,\nadministering, or dispensing any puberty blocker or hormone,”\n§68–33–102(5), for the purpose of (1) “[e]nabling a minor to\nidentify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with\nthe minor’s sex,” or (2) “[t]reating purported discomfort or\ndistress from a discordance between the minor’s sex and asserted\nidentity,” §68–33–103(a)(1). Among other things, these prohibitions\nare intended to “protec[t] minors from physical and emotional harm”\nby “encouraging minors to appreciate,” rather than “become\ndisdainful of,” their sex. §68–33–101(m). SB1 is limited in two relevant ways. First, SB1\ndoes not restrict the administration of puberty blockers or\nhormones to individuals 18 and over. §68–33–102(6). Second, SB1\ndoes not ban fully the administration of such drugs to minors. A\nhealthcare provider may administer puberty blockers or hormones to\ntreat a minor’s congenital defect, precocious (or early) puberty,\ndisease, or physical injury. §68–33–103(b)(1)(A). The law defines\nthe term “[c]ongenital defect” to include an “abnormality present\nin a minor that is inconsistent with the normal development of a\nhuman being of the minor’s sex,” §68–33–102(1), but excludes from\nthe definitions of “[c]ongenital defect” and “disease” “gender\ndysphoria, gender identity disorder, [and] gender incongruence,”\n§§68–33–102(1), 68–33–103(b)(2). SB1 contains three primary enforcement\nmechanisms. The law authorizes Tennessee’s attorney general to\nbring against any person who knowingly violates SB1 an action “to\nenjoin further violations, to disgorge any profits received due to\nthe medical procedure, and to recover a civil penalty of [$25,000]\nper violation.” §68–33–106(b). SB1 further permits the relevant\nstate regulatory authorities to discipline healthcare providers who\nviolate the law’s prohibitions. §68–33–107. Finally, SB1 creates a\nprivate right of action that enables an injured minor or\nnonconsenting parent of an injured minor to sue a healthcare\nprovider for violating the law. §68–33–105. C Three transgender minors, their parents, and a\ndoctor (plaintiffs) brought a pre-enforcement challenge to SB1.\nAmong other things, the plaintiffs asserted that SB1 violates the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They moved for\na preliminary injunction preventing the law’s bans on sex\ntransition treatments for minors from going into effect. The United\nStates intervened under 42 U. S. C. §2000h–2, which\nauthorizes the Federal Government to intervene in a private equal\nprotection suit “if the Attorney General certifies that the case is\nof general public importance.” See Memorandum Opinion and Order in\nNo. 23–cv–00376 (MD Tenn., May 16, 2023), ECF Doc. 108. The District Court partially enjoined\nenforcement of SB1’s prohibitions. See L. W. v. Skrmetti , 679 F. Supp. 3d 668, 677 (MD Tenn. 2023). The\ncourt concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge\nthe law’s ban on sex transition surgery for minors. Id ., at\n681–682. But the court held, as relevant, that the United States\nand plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their equal protection\nchallenge to the law’s prohibitions on puberty blockers and\nhormones. Id ., at 682–712. The court found that transgender\nindividuals constitute a quasi-suspect class, that SB1\ndiscriminates on the basis of sex and transgender status, and that\nSB1 was unlikely to survive intermediate scrutiny. Id ., at\n686–687, 698, 712. Having concluded that SB1 was likely\nunconstitutional on its face, the District Court issued a statewide\ninjunction enjoining enforcement of all provisions of SB1 except\nfor the private right of action and the law’s ban on sex transition\nsurgery. See id ., at 680–681, 716–718. Tennessee appealed,\nand the Sixth Circuit stayed the preliminary injunction pending\nappeal. L. W. v. Skrmetti , 83 F. 4th 460, 469\n(CA6 2023). The Sixth Circuit reversed. As relevant, the\nSixth Circuit held that the United States and plaintiffs were\nunlikely to succeed on the merits of their equal protection claim.\nSee id ., at 479–489. The court first found that SB1 does not\nclassify on the basis of sex because the law “regulate[s]\nsex-transition treatments for all minors, regardless of sex,” by\nprohibiting all minors from “receiv[ing] puberty blockers or\nhormones or surgery in order to transition from one sex to\nanother.” Id ., at 480. The court next declined to recognize\ntransgender individuals as a suspect class, finding that\ntransgender individuals are neither politically powerless nor a\ndiscrete group defined by obvious, immutable, or distinguishing\ncharacteristics. Id ., at 486–487. Finally, the court\nconcluded that the United States and plaintiffs had failed to\nestablish that animus toward transgender individuals as a class was\nthe operative force behind SB1. See id ., at 487–488. The\nSixth Circuit held that SB1 was subject to and survived rational\nbasis review, finding that Tennessee had offered “considerable\nevidence” regarding the risks associated with the banned medical\ntreatments and the flaws in existing research. Id ., at\n489. Judge White dissented. Judge White would have\nheld that the United States and plaintiffs were likely to succeed\non the merits of their equal protection claim. Id ., at 498.\nIn her view, SB1 triggered heightened scrutiny because it “facially\ndiscriminate[s] based on a minor’s sex as assigned at birth and on\na minor’s failure to conform with societal expectations concerning\nthat sex.” Ibid . Judge White would have held that Tennessee\nhad failed to “show an exceeding[ly] persuasive justification or\nclose means-ends fit” for the law’s sex-based classifications. Ibid. We granted certiorari to decide whether SB1\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.[ 1 ] 602 U. S.\n___ (2024). II The Fourteenth Amendment’s command that no\nState shall “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\nprotection of the laws,” U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1, “must\ncoexist with the practical necessity that most legislation\nclassifies for one purpose or another, with resulting disadvantage\nto various groups or persons,” Romer v. Evans , 517 U.S.\n620 , 631 (1996). We have reconciled the principle of equal\nprotection with the reality of legislative classification by\nholding that, “if a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor\ntargets a suspect class, we will uphold the legislative\nclassification so long as it bears a rational relation to some\nlegitimate end.” Ibid. We generally afford such laws “wide\nlatitude” under this rational basis review, acknowledging that “the\nConstitution presumes that even improvident decisions will\neventually be rectified by the democratic processes.” Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc. , 473 U.S.\n432 , 440 (1985). Certain legislative classifications, however,\nprompt heightened review. For example, laws that classify on the\nbasis of race, alienage, or national origin trigger strict scrutiny\nand will pass constitutional muster “only if they are suitably\ntailored to serve a compelling state interest.” Ibid. We\nhave similarly held that sex-based classifications warrant\nheightened scrutiny. See United States v. Virginia , 518 U.S.\n515 , 533 (1996). While our precedent does not make sex a\n“proscribed classification,” ibid. , we have explained that\nsex “generally provides no sensible ground for differential\ntreatment,” Cleburne , 473 U. S., at 440, and that\nsex-based lines too often reflect stereotypes or overbroad\ngeneralizations about the differences between men and women, see Sessions v. Morales-Santana , 582 U.S. 47, 62 (2017).\nWe accordingly subject laws containing sex-based classifications to\nintermediate scrutiny, under which the State must show that the\n“classification serves important governmental objectives and that\nthe discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the\nachievement of those objectives.” Virginia , 518 U. S.,\nat 533 (internal quotation marks omitted). A We are asked to decide whether SB1 is subject\nto heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. We hold\nit is not. SB1 does not classify on any bases that warrant\nheightened review. 1 On its face, SB1 incorporates two\nclassifications. First, SB1 classifies on the basis of age.\nHealthcare providers may administer certain medical treatments to\nindividuals ages 18 and older but not to minors. Second, SB1\nclassifies on the basis of medical use. Healthcare providers may\nadminister puberty blockers or hormones to minors to treat certain\nconditions but not to treat gender dysphoria, gender identity\ndisorder, or gender incongruence. Classifications that turn on age\nor medical use are subject to only rational basis review. See Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia , 427 U.S.\n307 , 312–314 (1976) ( per curiam ) (rational basis review\napplies to age-based classification); Vacco v. Quill , 521 U.S.\n793 , 799–808 (1997) (state laws outlawing assisted suicide\n“neither infringe fundamental rights nor involve suspect\nclassifications”). The plaintiffs argue that SB1 warrants\nheightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.\nSee Brief for Respondents in Support of Petitioner 20–37. We\ndisagree. Neither of the above classifications turns on\nsex. Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering\npuberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses , regardless of a minor’s sex. Cf. Vacco ,\n521 U. S., at 800 (“On their faces, neither New York’s ban on\nassisting suicide nor its statutes permitting patients to refuse\nmedical treatment treat anyone differently from anyone else or draw\nany distinctions between persons. Everyone , regardless of\nphysical condition, is entitled, if competent, to refuse unwanted\nlifesaving medical treatment; no one is permitted to assist\na suicide.”). The plaintiffs resist this conclusion, arguing\nthat SB1 creates facial sex-based classifications by defining the\nprohibited medical care based on the patient’s sex. See Brief for\nRespondents in Support of Petitioner 22. This argument takes two\nforms. At times, the plaintiffs suggest that SB1 classifies on the\nbasis of sex because its prohibitions reference sex. Alternatively,\nthe plaintiffs contend that SB1 works a sex-based classification\nbecause application of the law turns on sex. Neither argument is\npersuasive. This Court has never suggested that mere\nreference to sex is sufficient to trigger heightened scrutiny. See, e . g ., Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS , 533 U.S.\n53 , 64 (2001) (“The issue is not the use of gender specific\nterms instead of neutral ones. Just as neutral terms can mask\ndiscrimination that is unlawful, gender specific terms can mark a\npermissible distinction.”). Such an approach, moreover, would be\nespecially inappropriate in the medical context. Some medical\ntreatments and procedures are uniquely bound up in sex. The Food\nand Drug Administration itself recognizes that “[r]esearch has\nshown that biological differences between men and women\n(differences due to sex chromosome or sex hormones) may contribute\nto variations seen in the safety and efficacy of drugs, biologics,\nand medical devices.” FDA, Sex as a Biological Variable (Jan. 30,\n2025) (online source archived at https://www.supremecourt.gov).\nIndeed, the agency frequently approves drugs for use by only one\nsex. See, e . g ., FDA, FDA in Brief: FDA Encourages\nInclusion of Male Patients in Breast Cancer Clinical Trials (Aug.\n26, 2019) (online source archived at https://www.supremecourt .gov)\n(“many” breast cancer treatments approved for women only); FDA, FDA\nApproves Second Drug To Prevent HIV Infection as Part of Ongoing\nEfforts To End the HIV Epidemic (Oct. 3, 2019) (online source\narchived at https://www.supremecourt.gov) (drug to prevent HIV not\napproved for women). In the medical context, the mere use of\nsex-based language does not sweep a statute within the reach of\nheightened scrutiny. We also reject the argument that the application\nof SB1 turns on sex. The plaintiffs and the dissent contend that an\nadolescent whose biological sex is female cannot receive puberty\nblockers or testosterone to live and present as a male, but an\nadolescent whose biological sex is male can, while an adolescent\nwhose biological sex is male cannot receive puberty blockers or\nestrogen to live and present as a female, but an adolescent whose\nbiological sex is female can. See Brief for Respondents in Support\nof Petitioner 22; post , at 10–15 (Sotomayor, J.,\ndissenting). So conceived, they argue, SB1 prohibits certain\ntreatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same\ntreatments for minors of the opposite sex. The plaintiffs and the dissent, however, contort\nthe meaning of the term “medical treatment.” Notably absent from\ntheir framing is a key aspect of any medical treatment: the\nunderlying medical concern the treatment is intended to address.\nThe Food and Drug Administration approves drugs and requires that\nthey be labeled for particular indications—the diseases or\nconditions that they treat, prevent, mitigate, diagnose, or cure.\nSee 21 CFR §§201.57(c)(2), 314.50(a)(1) (2024). Different drugs can\nbe used to treat the same thing (would you like Advil or Tylenol\nfor your headache?), and the same drug can treat ",

WISCONSIN LABOR AND INDUSTRY REVIEW COMMISSION et al. certiorari to the supreme court of\nwisconsin No. 24–154. Argued March 31, 2025—Decided June\n5, 2025 Wisconsin law exempts certain religious\norganizations from paying unemployment compensation taxes. The\nrelevant statute exempts nonprofit organizations “operated\nprimarily for religious purposes” and “operated, supervised,\ncontrolled, or principally supported by a church or convention or\nassociation of churches.” Wis. Stat. §108.02(15)(h)(2).\nPetitioners, Catholic Charities Bureau, Inc., and four of its\nsubentities, sought this exemption as organizations controlled by\nthe Roman Catholic Diocese of Superior, Wisconsin. The Wisconsin\nSupreme Court denied the exemption, holding that petitioners were\nnot “operated primarily for religious purposes” because they\nneither engaged in proselytization nor limited their charitable\nservices to Catholics. Held : The Wisconsin Supreme\nCourt’s application of §108.02(15)(h)(2) to petitioners violates\nthe First Amendment. Pp. 7–15. (a) The First Amendment mandates\ngovernment neutrality between religions and subjects any\nstate-sponsored denominational preference to strict scrutiny. The\nWisconsin Supreme Court’s interpretation of §108.02(15)(h)(2)\nimposes a denominational preference by differentiating between\nreligions based on theological lines. Petitioners’ eligibility for\nthe exemption ultimately turns on inherently religious choices\n(namely, whether to proselytize or serve only co-religionists in\nthe course of charitable work), not “ ‘secular criteria’ ”\nthat “happen to have a ‘disparate impact’ upon different religious\norganizations.” Larson v. Valente , 456 U.S.\n228 , 247, n. 33. Because that regime explicitly differentiates\nbetween religions based on theological practices, strict scrutiny\napplies. Pp. 8–11. (b) The State argues that, when it comes\nto religious accommodations afforded by the government, courts\nshould ask whether the accommodation’s eligibility criteria are the\nproduct of “invidious discrimination” to determine if strict\nscrutiny applies. In support of that rule, the State draws on Gillette v. United States , 401\nU.S. 437 . Gillette , however, is inapposite. Unlike the\nconscientious objector status in Gillette , which was equally\navailable to members of all religions, the Wisconsin Supreme\nCourt’s interpretation of §108.02(15)(h)(2) facially differentiates\namong religions based on inherently theological choices. The State\nnext disputes the premise that petitioners were denied coverage\nbecause they do not proselytize or serve only Catholics in the\ncourse of performing charitable work. The State instead claims that\npetitioners were excluded because they engaged in no “distinctively\nreligious activity,” meaning “activities that express and inculcate\nreligious doctrine.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 81. That understanding of the\nWisconsin Supreme Court’s ruling, even if assumed correct, cannot\nsave the statute from strict scrutiny because decisions about\nwhether to “express and inculcate religious doctrine” while\nperforming charitable work are fundamentally theological choices\ndriven by religious doctrine. Pp. 11–13. (c)  Section 108.02(15)(h)(2), as\napplied, cannot survive strict scrutiny because the State has not\nmet its burden to show that the law’s application is narrowly\ntailored to further a compelling government interest. Wisconsin\ncontends that the exemption advances two principal interests.\nFirst, it argues that the law serves a compelling state interest in\nensuring unemployment coverage for its citizens. The State,\nhowever, has failed to demonstrate that the theological lines drawn\nby the statute are narrowly tailored to advance that interest,\nparticularly as applied to petitioners. Indeed, petitioners operate\ntheir own unemployment compensation system, which provides benefits\nlargely equivalent to the state system. The distinctions drawn by\nWisconsin’s regime, moreover, are underinclusive, exempting\nreligious entities that provide similar services\n( i . e ., without proselytizing or serving only\nco-religionists) when the work is done directly by a church.\nSecond, the State asserts an interest in avoiding entanglement with\nemployment decisions based on religious doctrine. Resolving\nmisconduct disputes for employees tasked with inculcating religious\nfaith, the State argues, may require it to decide whether those\nemployees complied with religious doctrine. The lines drawn by the\nexemption, however, are overinclusive in relation to that interest,\nfor they operate at the organizational level, covering employees\nthat do and do not inculcate religious doctrine in equal measure.\nThis poor fit between the State’s asserted interests and the\ndistinctions drawn cannot satisfy strict scrutiny.\nPp. 13–15. 2024 WI 13, 411 Wis. 2d 1, 3 N. W. 3d 666,\nreversed and remanded. Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion for a\nunanimous Court. Thomas, J., and Jackson, J., filed concurring\nopinions. NOTICE: This opinion is subject to\nformal revision before publication in the United States Reports.\nReaders are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme\nCourt of the United States, Washington, D. C. 20543,\npio@supremecourt.gov, of any typographical or other formal\nerrors. SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ No. 24–154 _________________ CATHOLIC CHARITIES BUREAU, INC., et al.,\nPETITIONERS v. WISCONSIN LABOR & INDUSTRY REVIEW\nCOMMISSION, et al. on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\nwisconsin [June 5, 2025] Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the\nCourt. Wisconsin, like many other States, exempts\ncertain religious organizations from paying taxes into the State’s\nunemployment compensation system. One such exemption covers\nnonprofits “operated primarily for religious purposes” and\ncontrolled, supervised, or principally supported by a church. Wis.\nStat. §108.02(15)(h)(2) (2023–2024). Petitioners, Catholic\nCharities Bureau, Inc., and four of the entities that it operates,\nclaimed that they qualify for the exemption as religious\norganizations controlled by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Superior,\nWisconsin. The Wisconsin Supreme Court disagreed, holding that\npetitioners are not “operated primarily for religious purposes”\nbecause they neither engage in proselytization nor serve only\nCatholics in their charitable work. The question here is whether §108.02(15)(h)(2),\nas applied to petitioners by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, violates\nthe First Amendment. The Court holds that it does. The First\nAmendment mandates government neutrality between religions and\nsubjects any state-sponsored denominational preference to strict\nscrutiny. The Wisconsin Supreme Court’s application of\n§108.02(15)(h)(2) imposed a denominational preference by\ndifferentiating between religions based on theological lines.\nBecause the law’s application does not survive strict scrutiny, it\ncannot stand. I A Wisconsin has long operated an unemployment\ncompensation program that seeks to mitigate and “more fairly”\ndistribute the “economic burdens resulting from unemployment.” Wis.\nStat. §108.01(2); see §108.01 et seq . To achieve that\ngoal, Wisconsin law requires most employers to make regular\ncontributions to the State’s unemployment fund through payroll\ntaxes. See §§108.17–108.18. Nonprofit employers may choose between\ncontributing to that fund and reimbursing the State for benefits\npaid to their laid-off employees. See §108.151. Wisconsin’s regime contains an exemption for\nreligious employers. See §108.02(15)(h). The exemption applies to\nany “church or convention or association of churches,” without\nfurther qualification, and to services provided “[b]y a duly\nordained, commissioned or licensed minister of a church in the\nexercise of his or her ministry or by a member of a religious order\nin the exercise of duties required by such order.”\n§§108.02(15)(h)(1), (3). As relevant here, the exemption also\ncovers nonprofit organizations “operated, supervised, controlled,\nor principally supported by a church or convention or association\nof churches,” but only if they are “operated primarily for religious purposes.”\n§108.02(15)(h)(2). Wisconsin is not alone in exempting religious\norganizations from unemployment compensation taxes. The Federal\nUnemployment Tax Act, 26 U. S. C. §3301 et seq ., contains a textually parallel\nreligious-employer exemption. See §3309(b)(1)(B). Since Congress\nenacted that law in 1970, over 40 States have adopted similar\nexemptions.[ 1 ] B Catholic Charities Bureau, Inc., (Bureau), is a\nnonprofit organization that serves as the social ministry arm of\nthe Roman Catholic Diocese of Superior, Wisconsin. 2024 WI 13, ¶4,\n411 Wis. 2d 1, 13, 3 N. W. 3d 666, 672. The Bureau’s stated\nmission is to “carry on the redeeming work of our Lord.” App. to\nPet. for Cert. 382a. In aid of that mission, the Bureau “provid[es]\nservices to the poor and disadvantaged” and seeks to “be an\neffective sign of the charity of Christ.” Id ., at 383a. It\ndoes not distinguish on the basis of “race, sex, or religion in\nreference to clients served, staff employed and board members\nappointed.” Ibid . The Bureau oversees several separately\nincorporated entities, including four that, together with the\nBureau, are the petitioners here: Barron County Development\nServices, Inc., Black River Industries, Inc., Diversified Services,\nInc., and Headwaters, Inc. 411 Wis. 2d, at 14–16, 3 N. W. 3d,\nat 672–673. These entities provide a range of charitable services\nto local communities across Wisconsin. Barron County Development\nServices, for instance, helps individuals with disabilities secure\nemployment. See id ., at 14, 3 N. W. 3d, at 673. Black\nRiver Industries provides daily living services to Wisconsinites\nwith developmental or mental health disabilities, among other\ncharitable services. Id ., at 15, 3 N. W. 3d, at\n673. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Superior\nexercises control over both the Bureau and its subentities. Id ., at 14, 3 N. W. 3d, at 672. The bishop of the\nDiocese serves as the Bureau’s president and appoints its\nmembership, which in turn oversees the Bureau “ ‘to\nensure’ ” that it fulfills its mission “ ‘in compliance\nwith the Principles of Catholic social teaching.’ ” Ibid . The Bureau’s executive director, who need not be a\nCatholic priest, supervises the operations of each subentity. Id ., at 16, 3 N. W. 3d, at 673; see also 2023 WI App\n12, ¶11, 406 Wis. 2d 586, 596, 987 N.W.2d 778, 783. Employees of the Bureau and its subentities are\nnot required to ascribe to any particular religious faith, and the\nsame is true for the recipients of their charitable services. 411\nWis. 2d, at 16, 3 N. W. 3d, at 673; see also App. to Pet. for\nCert. 383a. Participants in petitioners’ charitable programs do not\nreceive religious training or orientation, and neither the Bureau\nnor its subentities “tr[ies] to ‘inculcate’ ” participants\nwith the Catholic faith. 411 Wis. 2d, at 16, 3 N. W. 3d, at\n673. That rule, petitioners explain, reflects religious doctrine\nprohibiting Catholic bodies from “ ‘misus[ing] works of\ncharity for purposes of proselytism.’ ” Brief for Petitioners\n10 (quoting Directory for the Pastoral Ministry of Bishops\n“Apostolorum Successores” ¶196 (2004)). According to petitioners,\nCatholic teachings distinguish between “evangelization,” which\ninvolves “sharing one’s faith,” and “proselytization,” which seeks\nto “influence” or “coerc[e]” others into accepting one’s religious\nviews. Tr. of Oral Arg. 22–23. The former is permitted, and the\nlatter is not, petitioners say. Id ., at 22; see Brief for\nPetitioners 10. C In 2016, petitioners sought from the Wisconsin\nDepartment of Workforce Development a determination that they\nqualified for the religious-employer exemption set forth in Wis.\nStat. §108.02(15)(h)(2). The department denied their request. See\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 351a. It acknowledged that petitioners are\n“supervised and controlled by the Roman Catholic Church,” thereby\nsatisfying one of the two criteria for the exemption. Id .,\nat 352a, 356a, 360a, 364a, 368a. The department determined,\nhowever, that petitioners are not “operated primarily for religious\npurposes” within the meaning of the statute. Ibid. Petitioners appealed, and an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)\nreversed the department’s ruling. Id ., at 291a–350a. In the years that followed, petitioners\nreceived a series of alternating wins and losses as the parties\nappealed up through the state administrative and judicial systems.\nThe Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission reversed the\nALJ’s decision and reinstated the department’s denials of\npetitioners’ exemption requests. See App. to Pet. for Cert.\n212a–290a. After petitioners sought judicial review in state court,\nthe state trial court overrode the commission, holding that\npetitioners are entitled to the exemption. See id ., at 190a.\nThe State Court of Appeals, however, subsequently reversed. 406\nWis. 2d 586, 987 N.W.2d 778. It reasoned that petitioners are not\n“operated primarily for religious purposes” because petitioners’\n“provision of charitable social services . . . are\nneither inherently or primarily religious activities.” Id .,\nat 627, 629, 987 N. W. 2d, at 798, 799. The Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed. The court\nbegan by recognizing, as the lower courts had, that petitioners are\n“without question ‘operated, supervised, controlled, or principally\nsupported’ by the Diocese of Superior.” 411 Wis. 2d, at 22, 3\nN. W. 3d, at 676 (quoting §108.02(15)(h)(2)). The dispositive\nquestion, then, was whether petitioners are “operated primarily for\nreligious purposes.” Id ., at 22, 3 N. W. 3d, at 676.\nThe court interpreted that statutory phrase to require judicial\ninquiry into not only an organization’s “motivations” but also its\n“activities.” Id ., at 33, 3 N. W. 3d, at 682. To\ndetermine whether an organization’s activities are\n“ ‘primarily’ religious in nature,” the court held, courts\nshould “focu[s] on whether an organization participated in worship\nservices, religious outreach, ceremony, or religious education.” Id ., at 34–35, 3 N. W. 3d, at 682 (citing United\nStates v. Dykema , 666 F.2d 1096, 1100 (CA7 1981)).\nAccording to the court, that analysis would identify “ ‘[t]ypical\nactivities of an organization operated for religious\npurposes,’ ” while avoiding “ ‘any subjective inquiry\nwith respect to religious truth.’ ” 411 Wis. 2d, at 32, 3\nN. W. 3d, at 681 (quoting Dykema , 666 F. 2d, at\n1100; alteration in original). Applying that standard, the court held that\npetitioners’ activities are “secular in nature,” not religious. 411\nWis. 2d, at 38, 3 N. W. 3d, at 684. Petitioners “neither\nattempt to imbue program participants with the Catholic faith nor\nsupply any religious materials to program participants or\nemployees,” the court observed. Id ., at 35, 3 N. W. 3d,\nat 682. “Both employment with the organizations and services\noffered by the organizations are open to all participants\nregardless of religion,” and the charitable services offered by the\nsubentities could “be provided by organizations of either religious\nor secular motivations.” Id. , at 35–36, 3 N. W. 3d, at\n683. Based on that record, the court held that petitioners “are not\noperated primarily for religious purposes within the meaning of\nWis. Stat. §108.02(15)(h)(2).” Id ., at 38, 3 N. W. 3d,\nat 684. The court then addressed petitioners’ argument\nthat its interpretation of §108.02(15)(h)(2) violated the First\nAmendment’s Religion Clauses. The court first held that its\ninterpretation did not transgress church autonomy principles\nbecause the exemption “neither regulates internal church governance\nnor mandates any activity.” Id ., at 50, 3 N. W. 3d, at\n690. The court also determined that there was no risk of excessive\ngovernment entanglement with religion because Wisconsin’s exemption\ndoes not ask whether petitioners’ “activities are consistent or\ninconsistent with Catholic doctrine.” Id ., at 45, 3\nN. W. 3d, at 687. Finally, the court rejected petitioners’\nargument that its interpretation contravened First Amendment\nprinciples of “ ‘neutrality among religions’ ” by\n“ ‘favor[ing] religious groups that require those they serve\nto adhere to the faith of that group or be subject to\nproselytization.’ ” Id ., at 52–53, 3 N. W. 3d, at\n691. This argument failed, the court said, because petitioners had\nnot “demonstrate[d] that the statute imposes a constitutionally\nsignificant burden on their religious practice” in the first place. Id ., at 55, 3 N. W. 3d, at 692.[ 2 ] Justice Rebecca Grassl Bradley authored a\ndissent, which Chief Justice Ziegler joined and Justice Hagedorn\njoined in part. Justice Bradley would have held that a nonprofit is\n“operated primarily for religious purposes,” §108.02(15)(h)(2),\nwhen its motivations are religious, irrespective of the nature of\nits activities. The majority’s contrary approach, the dissent\nwarned, “engages in religious discrimination and entangles the\nstate with religion in violation of the First Amendment.” Id ., at 92–93, 3 N. W. 3d, at 710–711. While Justice\nBradley recognized that “the application of secular criteria that\nleads to disparate treatment of religions is not religious\ndiscrimination,” she reasoned that the majority’s approach\n“necessarily and explicitly discriminates among certain religious\nfaiths and religious practices.” Id ., at 105, 3 N. W.\n3d, at 717. It did so as applied to petitioners, Justice Bradley\nexplained, by declaring them ineligible for the exemption based on\nexplicitly religious criteria, including their adherence to\nCatholic teachings forbidding “proselytiz[ation] when conducting\ncharitable acts.” Id ., at 106, 3 N. W. 3d, at 717. That\ndenominational discrimination, according to Justice Bradley,\ntriggered strict scrutiny, which the State could not satisfy. See id ., at 108–110, 3 N. W. 3d, at 718–719. Justice\nHagedorn dissented separately, noting his agreement with Justice\nBradley’s construction of the statute. Id ., at 122, 3\nN. W. 3d, at 725. We granted certiorari to decide whether the\nWisconsin Supreme Court’s interpretation of §108.02(15)(h)(2), as\napplied to petitioners, violates the First Amendment. 604\nU. S. ___ (2024). II A “The clearest command of the Establishment\nClause” is that the government may not “officially prefe[r]” one\nreligious denomination over another. Larson v. Valente , 456\nU.S. 228 , 244 (1982). This principle of denominational\nneutrality bars States from passing laws that “ ‘aid or\noppose’ ” particular religions, Epperson v. Arkansas , 393 U.S.\n97 , 106 (1968), or interfere in the “competition between\nsects,” Zorach v. Clauson , 343\nU.S. 306 , 314 (1952). The Establishment Clause’s “prohibition\nof denominational preferences is inextricably connected with the\ncontinuing vitality of the Free Exercise Clause,” too. Larson , 456 U. S., at 245. That is because the\n“ ‘fullest realization of true religious liberty requires that\ngovernment’ ” refrain from “ ‘favoritism among\nsects.’ ” Id ., at 246 (quoting School Dist. of\nAbington Township v. Schempp , 374\nU.S. 203 , 305 (1963) (Goldberg, J., concurring)). Government\nactions that favor certain religions, the Court has warned, convey\nto members of other faiths that “ ‘they are outsiders, not\nfull members of the political community.’ ” Santa Fe\nIndependent School Dist. v. Doe , 530\nU.S. 290 , 309 (2000). To guard against that serious harm, this Court\nin Larson v. Valente , 456 U.S.\n228 , set a demanding standard for the government to justify\ndifferential treatment across religions on denominational lines.\nSee id ., at 244–246. When a state law establishes a\ndenominational preference, courts must “treat the law as suspect”\nand apply “strict scrutiny in adjudging its constitutionality.” Id ., at 246. The government bears the burden to show that\nthe relevant law, or application thereof, is “closely fitted to\nfurther a compelling governmental interest.” Id ., at 251\n(internal quotation marks omitted). A law that differentiates between religions\nalong theological lines is textbook denominational discrimination.\nTake, for instance, a law that treats “a religious service of\nJehovah’s Witnesses . . . differently than a religious\nservice of other sects” because the former is “less ritualistic,\nmore unorthodox, [and] less formal.” Fowler v. Rhode\nIsland , 345 U.S.\n67 , 69 (1953). Or consider an exemption that applies only to\nreligious organizations that perform baptisms, engage in\nmonotheistic worship, or hold services on Sunday. Such laws\nestablish a preference for certain religions based on the content\nof their religious doctrine, namely, how they worship, hold\nservices, or initiate members and whether they engage in those\npractices at all. Such official differentiation on theological\nlines is fundamentally foreign to our constitutional order, for\n“[t]he law knows no heresy, and is committed to the support of no\ndogma.” Watson v. Jones , 13 Wall. 679, 728\n(1872). This case involves that paradigmatic form of\ndenominational discrimination. In determining whether petitioners\nqualified for the tax exemption under §108.02(15)(h)(2), the\nWisconsin Supreme Court acknowledged that petitioners are\ncontrolled by a church, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Superior,\nthereby satisfying one of the exemption’s two criteria. 411 Wis.\n2d, at 22, 3 N. W. 3d, at 676. The court’s inquiry instead\nturned on whether petitioners are “operated primarily for religious\npurposes.” Wis. Stat. §108.02(15)(h)(2); see 411 Wis. 2d, at 22, 3\nN. W. 3d, at 676. On that criterion, the court recognized that\npetitioners’ charitable works are religiously motivated. Id ., at 34, 3 N. W. 3d, at 682. The court nevertheless\ndeemed petitioners ineligible for the exemption under\n§108.02(15)(h)(2) because they do not “attempt to imbue program\nparticipants with the Catholic faith,” “supply any religious\nmaterials to program participants or employees,” or limit their\ncharitable services to members of the Catholic Church. Id. ,\nat 35, 3 N. W. 3d, at 682–683. Put simply, petitioners could\nqualify for the exemption while providing their current charitable\nservices if they engaged in proselytization or limited their\nservices to fellow Catholics. Petitioners’ Catholic faith, however, bars them\nfrom satisfying those criteria. Catholic teaching, petitioners say,\nforbids “ ‘misus[ing] works of charity for purposes of\nproselytism.’ ” Brief for Petitioners 10 (quoting Directory\nfor the Pastoral Ministry of Bishops “Apostolorum Successores”\n¶196). It also requires provision of charitable services “without\nmaking distinctions ‘by race, sex, or religion.’ ” Brief for\nPetitioners 7 (quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 431a). Many religions\napparently impose similar rules prohibiting proselytization or\nreligious differentiation in the provision of charitable services.\nSee Brief for Religious Liberty Scholars as Amici Curiae 12–13 (discussing beliefs in Judaism, Islam, Sikhism, and\nHinduism). Others seemingly have adopted a contrary approach. See id ., at 12 (discussing practices of some Protestant\ndenominations). Wisconsin’s exemption, as interpreted by its\nSupreme Court, thus grants a denominational preference by\nexplicitly differentiating between religions based on theological\npractices. Indeed, petitioners’ eligibility for the exemption\nultimately turns on inherently religious choices (namely, whether\nto proselytize or serve only co-religionists), not “ ‘secular\ncriteria’ ” that “happen to have a ‘disparate impact’ upon\ndifferent religious organizations.” Larson , 456 U. S.,\nat 247, n. 23. Much like a law exempting only those religious\norganizations that perform baptisms or worship on Sundays, an\nexemption that requires proselytization or exclusive service of\nco-religionists establishes a preference for certain religions\nbased on the commands of their religious doctrine. In short, as applied to petitioners by the\nWisconsin Supreme Court, Wis. Stat. §108.02(15)(h)(2) imposes a\ndenominational preference by differentiating between religions\nbased on theological choices. B The State does not dispute that the government\nmay not prefer one religion over another. See Brief for Respondents\n35. Instead, the State argues that, when it comes to “[r]eligious\naccommodations” afforded by the government, courts should ask\nwhether the accommodation’s eligibility criteria are the product of\n“invidious discrimination” to determine if strict scrutiny applies. Id ., at 35, 37; see id ., at 42–43. This Court’s\ndecision in Gillette v. United States , 401 U.S.\n437 (1971), the State contends, lends support to this rule. See\nBrief for Respondents 36. As the State would have it, Gillette stands for the premise that whenever a religious\n“accommodation’s line serves ‘considerations of a pragmatic nature’\nhaving ‘nothing to do with a design to foster or favor any sect,\nreligion, or cluster of religions,’ the Establishment Clause is not\noffended.” Brief for Respondents 36 (quoting Gillette , 401\nU. S., at 452–453). The inquiry set forth in Gillette ,\nhowever, is inapposite. There, this Court rejected an Establishment\nClause challenge to a provision of the Military Selective Service\nAct of 1967, which afforded a “conscientious objector” status to\nany person who, “ ‘by reason of religious training and\nbelief,’ ” was “ ‘conscientiously opposed to\nparticipation in war in any form.’ ” Gillette , 401\nU. S., at 441. Importantly, that exemption “focused on\nindividual conscientious belief, not on sectarian affiliation.” Id ., at 454. Conscientious objector status was thus\n“available on an equal basis” to members of all religions under the\nMilitary Selective Service Act, as this Court later explained in Larson . 456 U. S., at 247, n. 23 (discussing Gillette ). “[O]n its face,” the statute “simply d[id] not\ndiscriminate on the basis of religious affiliation.” Gillette , 401 U. S., at 450. The same is not true here. The Wisconsin\nSupreme Court’s interpretation of §108.02(h)(15)(2) facially\ndifferentiates among religions based on theological choices. After\nall, an exemption provided only to organizations that engage in\nproselytization or serve only co-religionists is not, on its face,\n“available on an equal basis” to all denominations. Larson ,\n456 U. S., at 247, n. 23. That type of “explicit” distinction\nbetween religious practices is what this Court has deemed subject\nto strict scrutiny, including in the context of religious\nexemptions. Ibid .; see id ., at 246–251. Next, the State disputes the premise that\npetitioners were denied coverage “because they do not proselytize\nor serve only Catholics” in the course of performing charitable\nwork. Brief for Respondents 37. The State insists that, instead,\nthe Wisconsin Supreme Court excluded petitioners because they had\n“identified no distinctively religious activity that would create\ndifficulty in resolving unemployment disputes.” Ibid. When\npressed at argument as to what would qualify as such “distinctively\nreligious activity” in the context of providing charitable\nservices, however, the State clarified that it meant “activities\nthat express and inculcate religious doctrine: worship,\nproselytization, religious education.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 81; see\nalso id ., at 84 (“What it comes down to is whether the\nemployees of the organization are expressing and inculcating\nreligious doctrine”). That understanding of the Wisconsin Supreme\nCourt’s ruling, even if assumed correct, cannot save the statute\nfrom strict scrutiny. Decisions about whether to “express and\ninculcate religious doctrine” through worship, proselytization, or\nreligious education when performing charitable work are, again,\nfundamentally theological choices driven by the content of\ndifferent religious doctrines. Id ., at 81. A statute that\nexcludes religious organizations from an accommodation on such\ngrounds facially favors some denominations over others. III Because §108.02(15)(h)(2) “grants\ndenominational preferences of the sort consistently and firmly\ndeprecated in our precedents,” it “must be invalidated unless it is\njustified by a compelling governmental interest” and is “closely\nfitted to further that interest.” Larson , 456 U. S., at\n246–247. The State bears the burden of clearing that high bar, and\nit has failed to do so here. Wisconsin justifies its law by reference to two\nprincipal interests. First, it argues that the law serves a\ncompelling state interest in “ensuring unemployment coverage for\nits citizens.” Brief for Respondents 44. Yet the State fails to\nexplain how the theological lines drawn by §108.02(15)(h)(2) are\nnarrowly tailored to advance that asserted interest, particularly\nas applied to petitioners. Indeed, petitioners operate their own\nunemployment compensation system for employees, which provides\nbenefits largely “ ‘equivalent’ ” to the state system.\n406 Wis. 2d, at 614, 987 N. W. 2d, at 792. Furthermore,\nWisconsin does not suggest that organizations like Catholic\nCharities, which decline to proselytize and choose to serve\nall-comers, are more likely to leave their employees without\nunemployment benefits. Nor could it: The record is devoid of such\nevidence. The distinctions drawn by Wisconsin’s regime,\nmoreover, are vastly underinclusive when it comes to ensuring\nunemployment coverage for its citizens. Wisconsin exempts over 40\nforms of “employment” from its unemployment compensation program.\nSee §§108.02(15)(f )–(kt). Notably, those exemptions cover\nreligious entities that provide charitable services in a similar\nmanner to petitioners (that is, without proselytizing or\ndenominational differentiation), but are exempt because the work is\ndone directly by the church itself or its ministers, rather than by\na separate nonprofit organization controlled by the church. See\n§§108.02(15)(h)(1), (3). That underinclusiveness leaves\n“ ‘appreciable damage to [the State’s] supposedly vital\ninterest unprohibited’ ” and therefore belies the State’s\nclaim of narrow tailoring. Reed v. Town of Gilbert , 576 U.S.\n155 , 172 (2015). Second, the State argues that the Wisconsin\nSupreme Court’s interpretation of §108.02(15)(h)(2) is “narrowly\ntailored to avoid entangling the state with employment decisions\ntouching on religious faith and doctrine.” Brief for Respondents\n44. When an organization’s employees “express an[d] inculcate\nreligious doctrine through worship, proselytization, and religious\neducation,” the State explains, “misconduct disputes could often\nforce the state to decide whether employees complied with religious\ndoctrine.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 72. Yet the State again fails to\ndemonstrate that §108.02(15)(h)(2) is “closely fitted to further”\nthat anti-entanglement interest. Larson , 456 U. S., at\n247. To the extent the State seeks to avoid opining on employee\ncompliance with religious teachings, it does not explain why it\ndeclined to craft an exemption limited to employees who are in fact\ntasked with inculcating religious doctrine. Instead, the exemption\nhere functions at an organizational level, covering both the\njanitor and the priest in equal measure. See §108.02(15)(h)(2). That overinclusiveness pervades Wisconsin’s\nexemption regime more broadly, too. Recall that Wisconsin exempts\nfrom its unemployment compensation system all “church[es] or\nconvention[s] or association[s] of churches” without\ndifferentiating between employees actually involved in religious\nworks, for whom the anti-entanglement concern is relevant, and\nother staff. §108.02(15)(h)(1). The State itself concedes, as it\nmust, that this regime contains “an element of over-inclusivity.”\nTr. of Oral Arg. 87. At bottom, then, the poor fit between the\nState’s asserted anti-entanglement concern and the line it has\ndrawn among religious organizations cannot be described as narrow\ntailoring. The State has thus failed to carry its burden under\nstrict scrutiny. *  *  * It is fundamental to our constitutional order\nthat the government maintain “neutrality between religion and\nreligion.” Epperson , 393 U. S., at 104. There may be\nhard calls to make in policing that rule, but this is not one. When\nthe government distinguishes among religions based on theological\ndifferences in their provision of services, it imposes a\ndenominational preference that must satisfy the highest level of\njudicial scrutiny. Because Wisconsin has transgressed that\nprinciple without the tailoring necessary to survive such scrutiny,\nthe judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court is reversed, and the\ncase is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this\nopinion. It is so ordered. Notes 1 Wisconsin does not cite\nany decisions interpreting these federal or state laws to require\nproselytization or exclusively co-religionist service for\ncharitable organizations to qualify",

    "fulltext": " SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES BRENDA EVERS ANDREW v. TAMIKA WHITE,\nWARDEN on petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the tenth circuit No. 23–6573. Decided January 21, 2025 Per Curiam. An Oklahoma jury convicted Brenda Andrew of\nmurdering her husband, Rob Andrew, and sentenced her to death. The\nState spent significant time at trial introducing evidence about\nAndrew’s sex life and about her failings as a mother and wife, much\nof which it later conceded was irrelevant. In a federal habeas\npetition, Andrew argued that this evidence had been so prejudicial\nas to violate the Due Process Clause. The Court of Appeals rejected\nthat claim because, it thought, no holding of this Court\nestablished a general rule that the erroneous admission of\nprejudicial evidence could violate due process. That was wrong. By\nthe time of Andrew’s trial, this Court had made clear that when\n“evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it\nrenders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for relief.” Payne v. Tennessee , 501 U.S.\n808 , 825 (1991). I A On November 20, 2001, Rob Andrew was fatally\nshot in his garage. Brenda Andrew, who herself had been shot in the\narm during the incident, told the police that two armed assailants\nhad committed the shooting. Andrew further explained that she had\nseparated from her husband and was now dating James Pavatt, but\nthat she and Rob continued to see each other as they had two\nchildren together. Pavatt and Andrew traveled to Mexico together\nafter Rob Andrew’s death and soon became suspects in his murder.\nEventually, Pavatt confessed to committing the shooting with a\nfriend. Pavatt denied that Andrew had been involved. The State\nthereafter charged both Pavatt and Andrew with capital murder, and\na jury convicted Pavatt and sentenced him to death. At Andrew’s trial, the prosecution sought to\nprove that Andrew had conspired with Pavatt, an insurance agent, to\nmurder her husband for the proceeds of his life insurance policy.\nAmong other things, the prosecution elicited testimony about\nAndrew’s sexual partners reaching back two decades; about the\noutfits she wore to dinner or during grocery runs; about the\nunderwear she packed for vacation; and about how often she had sex\nin her car. At least two of the prosecution’s guilt-phase witnesses\ntook the stand exclusively to testify about Andrew’s provocative\nclothing, and others were asked to comment on whether a good mother\nwould dress or behave the way Andrew had. In its closing statement,\nthe prosecution again invoked these themes, including by displaying\nAndrew’s “thong underwear” to the jury, by reminding the jury of\nAndrew’s alleged affairs during college, and by emphasizing that\nAndrew “had sex on [her husband] over and over and over” while\n“keeping a boyfriend on the side.” Tr. 4103, 4124–4125 (July 12,\n2004). At both the guilt and sentencing phases, prosecutors\ncontrasted Andrew with the victim, whom they asserted had been\n“committed to God.” Id. , at 4124; see also, e.g. , Tr.\n4402 (July 14, 2004) (suggesting nothing could mitigate murder of\nRob Andrew because he just “wanted to love God”).[ 1 ] B The jury convicted Andrew and sentenced her to\ndeath. On appeal, Andrew argued that the introduction\nof irrelevant evidence, including evidence “that she had\nextramarital sexual affairs with two other men,” that she had\n“ ‘come on to’ ” another witness’s sons, and that she had\ndressed provocatively at a restaurant, Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23, ¶¶42–59, 164 P.3d 176 , 190–193, violated Oklahoma law as well as the\nFederal Due Process Clause. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n(OCCA) held that admission of evidence about Andrew’s extramarital\naffairs had been proper because it showed that “[h]er co-defendant\nwas just the last in a long line of men that she seduced.” Id., at 192.[ 2 ] The OCCA\n“struggl[ed],” however, “to find any relevance . . .\nother than to show [Andrew’s] character” for the remaining\nchallenged evidence. Ibid . By now, the State “agree[d] that\nmost of this evidence was irrelevant to any issue in this case.” Ibid. The OCCA nonetheless denied relief on the ground that\nthe trial court’s errors had been harmless. Judge Johnson dissented in part. In his view,\nthe “egregious . . . pattern of introducing evidence that\nha[d] no purpose other than to hammer home that Brenda Andrew is a\nbad wife, a bad mother, and a bad woman . . .\ntrivialize[d] the value of her life in the minds of the jurors.” Id ., at 206–207. He would therefore have vacated her\nsentence. Judge Chapel dissented separately, indicating that he\nwould have reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. Id ., at 208. In federal court, Andrew reiterated her claim\nthat the admission of this evidence rendered the guilt and penalty\nphases of her trial fundamentally unfair, in violation of due\nprocess. 62 F. 4th 1299, 1312–1313 (CA10 2023). The District\nCourt denied relief. A divided Tenth Circuit affirmed because, it\nheld, Andrew had failed to cite “clearly established federal law\ngoverning her claim.” Id ., at 1314. The majority\nacknowledged that Andrew had cited Payne , in which this\nCourt said that the Due Process Clause “provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” when the introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence\n“renders [a] trial fundamentally unfair.” 501 U. S., at 825.\nAccording to the majority, however, that had been a\n“pronouncement,” not a “holding,” of this Court. 62 F. 4th, at\n1314. It therefore concluded Andrew had failed to identify “clearly\nestablished federal law governing her claim,” as required under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Id ., at 1316; 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). As a\nresult, the majority declined to consider whether the OCCA\nunreasonably applied Payne , i . e ., whether a\nfairminded jurist could hold that the admission of irrelevant\nevidence about Andrew’s demeanor as a woman was not so prejudicial\nas to deprive her of a fundamentally fair trial. 62 F. 4th, at 1316\n(“ ‘The absence of clearly established federal law is\ndispositive under §2254(d)(1)’ ” (quoting House v. Hatch , 527 F.3d 1010, 1018 (CA10 2008))). In dissent, Judge Bacharach condemned the\nState’s focus “from start to finish on Ms. Andrew’s sex life,” a\nmove he argued “portrayed Ms. Andrew as a scarlet woman, a modern\nJezebel, sparking distrust based on her loose morals\n. . . plucking away any realistic chance that the jury\nwould seriously consider her version of events.” 62 F. 4th, at\n1366. Judge Bacharach therefore would have held that the\ncombination of evidentiary errors “deprived Ms. Andrew of a\nfundamentally fair trial.” Id ., at 1377. II A federal court may grant habeas relief as to\na claim adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the state\ncourt relied on an unreasonable determination of the facts or\nunreasonably applied “clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by” this Court. 28 U. S. C. §§2254(d)(1)–(2).\nTo show that a state court unreasonably applied clearly established\nfederal law, a petitioner must show that the court unreasonably\napplied “ ‘the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this\nCourt’s decisions.’ ” White v. Woodall , 572 U.S.\n415 , 419 (2014) (quoting Howes v. Fields , 565 U.S.\n499 , 505 (2012)). An unreasonable application, in turn, is one\nwith which no fairminded jurist would agree. Harrington v. Richter , 562 U.S.\n86 , 101 (2011). A When this Court relies on a legal rule or\nprinciple to decide a case, that principle is a “holding” of the\nCourt for purposes of AEDPA. Lockyer v. Andrade , 538 U.S.\n63 , 71–72 (2003) (“[C]learly established Federal law\n. . . is the governing legal principle or principles set\nforth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its\ndecision” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Following these\nprinciples, it is clear that Andrew properly identified clearly\nestablished federal law. In Payne , this Court considered whether\nto overrule a set of prior cases that had categorically barred the\nintroduction of victim impact evidence during the sentencing phases\nof a capital trial. The Court noted that, in many circumstances,\n“victim impact evidence serves entirely legitimate purposes,” 501\nU. S., at 825, even though in others it could be prejudicial.\nIt then concluded that a categorical bar was not necessary to\nprotect against the risk of prejudicial testimony because “the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” against the introduction of evidence “that is so\nunduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair.” Ibid. (citing Darden v. Wainwright , 477 U.S.\n168 , 179–183 (1986)). In light of that protection, the Court\nheld, it could permit victim impact evidence where appropriate\nwithout risking undue prejudice to defendants. 501 U. S., at\n825. In other words, the Court removed one protection for capital\ndefendants (the per se bar on victim impact statements)\nin part because another protection (the Due Process Clause)\nremained available against evidence that is so unduly prejudicial\nthat it renders the trial fundamentally unfair. The legal principle\non which Andrew relies, that the Due Process Clause can in certain\ncases protect against the introduction of unduly prejudicial\nevidence at a criminal trial, was therefore indispensable to the\ndecision in Payne . That means it was a holding of this Court\nfor purposes of AEDPA. Importantly, Payne did not invent due\nprocess protections against unduly prejudicial evidence. The Court\nhad several times before held that prosecutors’ prejudicial or\nmisleading statements violate due process if they render a trial or\ncapital sentencing fundamentally unfair. Donnelly v. DeChristoforo , 416 U.S.\n637 (1974); Caldwell v. Mississippi , 472 U.S.\n320 , 338–340 (1985); Darden , 477 U. S., at 178–183. Payne thus broke little new ground in this respect. By the\ntime of the OCCA’s decision in this case, it was clear that the\nintroduction of unduly prejudicial evidence could, in certain\ncases, violate the Due Process Clause.[ 3 ] B The Court of Appeals nonetheless held that Payne “merely established that the Eighth Amendment did not\nerect a ‘ per se bar’ to the introduction of\nvictim-impact statements in capital cases.” 62 F. 4th, at 1314\n(quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 827). As just explained,\nhowever, Payne expressly relied on the availability of\nrelief under the Due Process Clause to reach that conclusion. This\nCourt has accordingly applied Payne ’s framework to a claim\nmuch like Andrew’s: “that the introduction of [prejudicial]\nevidence” at the sentencing phases “violated the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.” Romano v. Oklahoma , 512 U.S.\n1 , 12 (1994). More recently, the Court relied on Payne in the same way that Andrew sought to rely on it here: for the\nproposition that “the Due Process Clause . . . wards off\nthe introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence that would render\nthe trial fundamentally unfair.” Kansas v. Carr , 577 U.S.\n108 , 123 (2016) (quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 825;\ninternal quotation marks and alteration omitted). This Court has\nalso relied on the underlying fundamental fairness principle in the\njury-impartiality context. See Rideau v. Louisiana , 373 U.S.\n723 , 726 (1963); Skilling v. United States , 561 U.S.\n358 , 379 (2010). To the extent that the Court of Appeals thought\nitself constrained by AEDPA to limit Payne to its facts, it\nwas mistaken. General legal principles can constitute clearly\nestablished law for purposes of AEDPA so long as they are holdings\nof this Court. For example, the Eighth Amendment principle that a\nsentence may not be grossly disproportionate to the offense is\n“ ‘clearly established’ under §2554(d)(1),” even though it\narises out of a “thicket of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence” and\nlacks “ ‘precise contours.’ ” Lockyer , 538\nU. S., at 72. Although this Court has not previously relied on Payne to invalidate a conviction for improperly admitted\nprejudicial evidence, moreover, “certain principles are fundamental\nenough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to\napply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt.” White , 572\nU. S., at 427 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado , 541 U.S.\n652 , 666 (2004)); see also Taylor v. Riojas , 592\nU.S. 7, 9 (2020) ( per curiam ) (“ ‘[A] general\nconstitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may\napply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in\nquestion’ ” (quoting Hope v. Pelzer , 536 U.S.\n730 , 741 (2002))). The Court of Appeals thus erred by refusing\neven to consider whether the OCCA unreasonably applied established\ndue process principles to Andrew’s case. The dissent maintains that a reasonable jurist\ncould agree with the Tenth Circuit’s understanding of our\nprecedent. That assertion conflates the deference federal habeas\ncourts must extend to a state court’s “application of ” this\nCourt’s precedent with the federal courts’ independent obligation\nto first identify the relevant “clearly established Federal law.”\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1); Lockyer , 538 U. S.,\nat 71 (identifying clearly established law “[a]s a threshold\nmatter”). A legal principle is clearly established for purposes of\nAEDPA if it is a holding of this Court. White , 572\nU. S., at 419. This Court has no occasion to defer to other\nfederal courts’ erroneous interpretations of its own precedent. Nor\nis such double deference necessary to prevent expansion of federal\nhabeas relief to those who rely on “debatable” interpretations or\nextensions of our holdings. Post at 17–18 (opinion of\nThomas, J.). Andrew does not rely on an interpretation or extension\nof this Court’s cases but on a principle this Court itself has\nrelied on over the course of decades. Because the Tenth Circuit nonetheless held that\nno relevant clearly established law existed (a ruling this Court\nreviews de novo ) it never considered whether the state\ncourt’s application of that law was reasonable. On remand, the\nCourt of Appeals should conduct that inquiry in the first instance.\nSpecifically, the question now is whether a fairminded jurist\nreviewing this record could disagree with Andrew that the trial\ncourt’s mistaken admission of irrelevant evidence was so “unduly\nprejudicial” as to render her trial “fundamentally unfair.” Payne , 501 U. S., at 825. The Court of Appeals must ask that question\nseparately for the guilt and sentencing phases. As to each phase,\nit might consider the relevance of the disputed evidence to the\ncharges or sentencing factors, the degree of prejudice Andrew\nsuffered from its introduction, and whether the trial court\nprovided any mitigating instructions. Cf. Romano , 512\nU. S., at 13. The ultimate question is whether a fairminded\njurist could disagree that the evidence “so infected the trial with\nunfairness” as to render the resulting conviction or sentence\n“a denial of due process.” Ibid. *  *  * At the time of the OCCA’s decision, clearly\nestablished law provided that the Due Process Clause forbids the\nintroduction of evidence so unduly prejudicial as to render a\ncriminal trial fundamentally unfair. This Court accordingly grants\nthe petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis , vacates the judgment below, and remands\nthe case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Notes 1 The dissent recites what\nit insists was substantial evidence of Andrew’s guilt, contending\nin the process that this Court “inaccurately portrays” that\nevidence. Post , at 2 (opinion of Thomas, J.). In doing so,\nit prejudges the prejudice analysis by characterizing as fact the\nState’s narrative at trial. That narrative, of course, was hotly\ncontested then and remains so now. For example, the defense\nelicited testimony from multiple witnesses that Andrew knew on the\nday of the murder that she was not the beneficiary on the life\ninsurance policy. The OCCA held that the court also wrongly\nexcluded evidence Andrew argued would cast doubt on the theory that\nshe had staged the shooting, though the OCCA held that exclusion\nwas harmless. Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23,\n¶¶89–92, 164 P.3d 176 , 197. The Court today says nothing about the\nstrength of the evidence against Andrew because the issue of\nprejudice in both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial is\none for the Tenth Circuit to consider on remand. See infra ,\nat 9. Similarly, the dissent asserts that Andrew falsely accuses\nthe prosecution of calling her a “slut puppy” in closing argument. Post , at 7, n. 3 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Whether the\nprosecution quoted something it believed Andrew once said to\nsuggest to the jury that Andrew herself was a “slut puppy,” or\nsimply to recite an alleged abusive phone call, is a question of\nfact for the Tenth Circuit to resolve. 2 The dissent asserts that\nthe OCCA held evidence of Andrew’s “ ‘close personal\nrelationship’ ” with two of her affair partners to be relevant\nbecause it gave credence to testimony that Andrew had\n“ ‘shared with both of these men her hatred for Rob Andrew and\nher wish that he was dead.’ ” Post , at 6 (opinion of\nThomas, J.) (quoting 164 P. 3d, at 192). Andrew never objected\nto evidence that she had a “close personal relationship” with these\nmen. In fact, defense counsel stipulated that she had affairs with\nthem. See, e . g ., Tr. 338 (June 18, 2004) (“We’re not\ncontesting the affair. We have never contested the affair with\nNunley or Higgins”). Andrew’s claim instead concerned the extensive\ntestimony about how she flirted with these men, how she dressed\naround them, and how many times (and where) she had sex with them.\nThat testimony appears to have no bearing on Andrew’s alleged\nexpressions of hatred for her husband. 3 The dissent argues that Estelle v. McGuire , 502 U.S.\n62 (1991), shows otherwise because it left open whether\n“ ‘it is a violation of the due process guaranteed by the\nFourteenth Amendment for evidence that is not relevant to be\nreceived in a criminal trial.’ ” Post , at 16 (opinion\nof Thomas, J.) (quoting Estelle , 502 U. S., at 70). To\nbe sure, this Court did not hold in Payne that the\nintroduction of all irrelevant evidence violates the Due Process\nClause. Payne established, rather, that due process protects\ndefendants from the introduction of evidence so prejudicial as to\naffect the fundamental fairness of their trials. This Court\nsquarely acknowledged that rule in Estelle , explaining that\n“the challenged evidence” at issue there did not warrant relief\nbecause it did not “ ‘so infus[e] the trial with unfairness as\nto deny due process of law.’ ” 502 U. S., at 75 (quoting Lisenba v. California , 314 U.S.\n219 , 228 (1941), and citing Donnelly , 416 U. S., at\n643). In any event, and as recounted below, this Court has\ncontinued to rely on Payne ’s fundamental fairness principle\nsince Estelle .",

Tennessee , 501 U.S.\n808 , 825 (1991). I A On November 20, 2001, Rob Andrew was fatally\nshot in his garage. Brenda Andrew, who herself had been shot in the\narm during the incident, told the police that two armed assailants\nhad committed the shooting. Andrew further explained that she had\nseparated from her husband and was now dating James Pavatt, but\nthat she and Rob continued to see each other as they had two\nchildren together. Pavatt and Andrew traveled to Mexico together\nafter Rob Andrew’s death and soon became suspects in his murder.\nEventually, Pavatt confessed to committing the shooting with a\nfriend. Pavatt denied that Andrew had been involved. The State\nthereafter charged both Pavatt and Andrew with capital murder, and\na jury convicted Pavatt and sentenced him to death. At Andrew’s trial, the prosecution sought to\nprove that Andrew had conspired with Pavatt, an insurance agent, to\nmurder her husband for the proceeds of his life insurance policy.\nAmong other things, the prosecution elicited testimony about\nAndrew’s sexual partners reaching back two decades; about the\noutfits she wore to dinner or during grocery runs; about the\nunderwear she packed for vacation; and about how often she had sex\nin her car. At least two of the prosecution’s guilt-phase witnesses\ntook the stand exclusively to testify about Andrew’s provocative\nclothing, and others were asked to comment on whether a good mother\nwould dress or behave the way Andrew had. In its closing statement,\nthe prosecution again invoked these themes, including by displaying\nAndrew’s “thong underwear” to the jury, by reminding the jury of\nAndrew’s alleged affairs during college, and by emphasizing that\nAndrew “had sex on [her husband] over and over and over” while\n“keeping a boyfriend on the side.” Tr. 4103, 4124–4125 (July 12,\n2004). At both the guilt and sentencing phases, prosecutors\ncontrasted Andrew with the victim, whom they asserted had been\n“committed to God.” Id. , at 4124; see also, e.g. , Tr.\n4402 (July 14, 2004) (suggesting nothing could mitigate murder of\nRob Andrew because he just “wanted to love God”).[ 1 ] B The jury convicted Andrew and sentenced her to\ndeath. On appeal, Andrew argued that the introduction\nof irrelevant evidence, including evidence “that she had\nextramarital sexual affairs with two other men,” that she had\n“ ‘come on to’ ” another witness’s sons, and that she had\ndressed provocatively at a restaurant, Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23, ¶¶42–59, 164 P.3d 176 , 190–193, violated Oklahoma law as well as the\nFederal Due Process Clause. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n(OCCA) held that admission of evidence about Andrew’s extramarital\naffairs had been proper because it showed that “[h]er co-defendant\nwas just the last in a long line of men that she seduced.” Id., at 192.[ 2 ] The OCCA\n“struggl[ed],” however, “to find any relevance . . .\nother than to show [Andrew’s] character” for the remaining\nchallenged evidence. Ibid . By now, the State “agree[d] that\nmost of this evidence was irrelevant to any issue in this case.” Ibid. The OCCA nonetheless denied relief on the ground that\nthe trial court’s errors had been harmless. Judge Johnson dissented in part. In his view,\nthe “egregious . . . pattern of introducing evidence that\nha[d] no purpose other than to hammer home that Brenda Andrew is a\nbad wife, a bad mother, and a bad woman . . .\ntrivialize[d] the value of her life in the minds of the jurors.” Id ., at 206–207. He would therefore have vacated her\nsentence. Judge Chapel dissented separately, indicating that he\nwould have reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. Id ., at 208. In federal court, Andrew reiterated her claim\nthat the admission of this evidence rendered the guilt and penalty\nphases of her trial fundamentally unfair, in violation of due\nprocess. 62 F. 4th 1299, 1312–1313 (CA10 2023). The District\nCourt denied relief. A divided Tenth Circuit affirmed because, it\nheld, Andrew had failed to cite “clearly established federal law\ngoverning her claim.” Id ., at 1314. The majority\nacknowledged that Andrew had cited Payne , in which this\nCourt said that the Due Process Clause “provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” when the introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence\n“renders [a] trial fundamentally unfair.” 501 U. S., at 825.\nAccording to the majority, however, that had been a\n“pronouncement,” not a “holding,” of this Court. 62 F. 4th, at\n1314. It therefore concluded Andrew had failed to identify “clearly\nestablished federal law governing her claim,” as required under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Id ., at 1316; 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). As a\nresult, the majority declined to consider whether the OCCA\nunreasonably applied Payne , i . e ., whether a\nfairminded jurist could hold that the admission of irrelevant\nevidence about Andrew’s demeanor as a woman was not so prejudicial\nas to deprive her of a fundamentally fair trial. 62 F. 4th, at 1316\n(“ ‘The absence of clearly established federal law is\ndispositive under §2254(d)(1)’ ” (quoting House v. Hatch , 527 F.3d 1010, 1018 (CA10 2008))). In dissent, Judge Bacharach condemned the\nState’s focus “from start to finish on Ms. Andrew’s sex life,” a\nmove he argued “portrayed Ms. Andrew as a scarlet woman, a modern\nJezebel, sparking distrust based on her loose morals\n. . . plucking away any realistic chance that the jury\nwould seriously consider her version of events.” 62 F. 4th, at\n1366. Judge Bacharach therefore would have held that the\ncombination of evidentiary errors “deprived Ms. Andrew of a\nfundamentally fair trial.” Id ., at 1377. II A federal court may grant habeas relief as to\na claim adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the state\ncourt relied on an unreasonable determination of the facts or\nunreasonably applied “clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by” this Court. 28 U. S. C. §§2254(d)(1)–(2).\nTo show that a state court unreasonably applied clearly established\nfederal law, a petitioner must show that the court unreasonably\napplied “ ‘the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this\nCourt’s decisions.’ ” White v. Woodall , 572 U.S.\n415 , 419 (2014) (quoting Howes v. Fields , 565 U.S.\n499 , 505 (2012)). An unreasonable application, in turn, is one\nwith which no fairminded jurist would agree. Harrington v. Richter , 562 U.S.\n86 , 101 (2011). A When this Court relies on a legal rule or\nprinciple to decide a case, that principle is a “holding” of the\nCourt for purposes of AEDPA. Lockyer v. Andrade , 538 U.S.\n63 , 71–72 (2003) (“[C]learly established Federal law\n. . . is the governing legal principle or principles set\nforth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its\ndecision” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Following these\nprinciples, it is clear that Andrew properly identified clearly\nestablished federal law. In Payne , this Court considered whether\nto overrule a set of prior cases that had categorically barred the\nintroduction of victim impact evidence during the sentencing phases\nof a capital trial. The Court noted that, in many circumstances,\n“victim impact evidence serves entirely legitimate purposes,” 501\nU. S., at 825, even though in others it could be prejudicial.\nIt then concluded that a categorical bar was not necessary to\nprotect against the risk of prejudicial testimony because “the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” against the introduction of evidence “that is so\nunduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair.” Ibid. (citing Darden v. Wainwright , 477 U.S.\n168 , 179–183 (1986)). In light of that protection, the Court\nheld, it could permit victim impact evidence where appropriate\nwithout risking undue prejudice to defendants. 501 U. S., at\n825. In other words, the Court removed one protection for capital\ndefendants (the per se bar on victim impact statements)\nin part because another protection (the Due Process Clause)\nremained available against evidence that is so unduly prejudicial\nthat it renders the trial fundamentally unfair. The legal principle\non which Andrew relies, that the Due Process Clause can in certain\ncases protect against the introduction of unduly prejudicial\nevidence at a criminal trial, was therefore indispensable to the\ndecision in Payne . That means it was a holding of this Court\nfor purposes of AEDPA. Importantly, Payne did not invent due\nprocess protections against unduly prejudicial evidence. The Court\nhad several times before held that prosecutors’ prejudicial or\nmisleading statements violate due process if they render a trial or\ncapital sentencing fundamentally unfair. Donnelly v. DeChristoforo , 416 U.S.\n637 (1974); Caldwell v. Mississippi , 472 U.S.\n320 , 338–340 (1985); Darden , 477 U. S., at 178–183. Payne thus broke little new ground in this respect. By the\ntime of the OCCA’s decision in this case, it was clear that the\nintroduction of unduly prejudicial evidence could, in certain\ncases, violate the Due Process Clause.[ 3 ] B The Court of Appeals nonetheless held that Payne “merely established that the Eighth Amendment did not\nerect a ‘ per se bar’ to the introduction of\nvictim-impact statements in capital cases.” 62 F. 4th, at 1314\n(quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 827). As just explained,\nhowever, Payne expressly relied on the availability of\nrelief under the Due Process Clause to reach that conclusion. This\nCourt has accordingly applied Payne ’s framework to a claim\nmuch like Andrew’s: “that the introduction of [prejudicial]\nevidence” at the sentencing phases “violated the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.” Romano v. Oklahoma , 512 U.S.\n1 , 12 (1994). More recently, the Court relied on Payne in the same way that Andrew sought to rely on it here: for the\nproposition that “the Due Process Clause . . . wards off\nthe introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence that would render\nthe trial fundamentally unfair.” Kansas v. Carr , 577 U.S.\n108 , 123 (2016) (quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 825;\ninternal quotation marks and alteration omitted). This Court has\nalso relied on the underlying fundamental fairness principle in the\njury-impartiality context. See Rideau v. Louisiana , 373 U.S.\n723 , 726 (1963); Skilling v. United States , 561 U.S.\n358 , 379 (2010). To the extent that the Court of Appeals thought\nitself constrained by AEDPA to limit Payne to its facts, it\nwas mistaken. General legal principles can constitute clearly\nestablished law for purposes of AEDPA so long as they are holdings\nof this Court. For example, the Eighth Amendment principle that a\nsentence may not be grossly disproportionate to the offense is\n“ ‘clearly established’ under §2554(d)(1),” even though it\narises out of a “thicket of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence” and\nlacks “ ‘precise contours.’ ” Lockyer , 538\nU. S., at 72. Although this Court has not previously relied on Payne to invalidate a conviction for improperly admitted\nprejudicial evidence, moreover, “certain principles are fundamental\nenough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to\napply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt.” White , 572\nU. S., at 427 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado , 541 U.S.\n652 , 666 (2004)); see also Taylor v. Riojas , 592\nU.S. 7, 9 (2020) ( per curiam ) (“ ‘[A] general\nconstitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may\napply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in\nquestion’ ” (quoting Hope v. Pelzer , 536 U.S.\n730 , 741 (2002))). The Court of Appeals thus erred by refusing\neven to consider whether the OCCA unreasonably applied established\ndue process principles to Andrew’s case. The dissent maintains that a reasonable jurist\ncould agree with the Tenth Circuit’s understanding of our\nprecedent. That assertion conflates the deference federal habeas\ncourts must extend to a state court’s “application of ” this\nCourt’s precedent with the federal courts’ independent obligation\nto first identify the relevant “clearly established Federal law.”\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1); Lockyer , 538 U. S.,\nat 71 (identifying clearly established law “[a]s a threshold\nmatter”). A legal principle is clearly established for purposes of\nAEDPA if it is a holding of this Court. White , 572\nU. S., at 419. This Court has no occasion to defer to other\nfederal courts’ erroneous interpretations of its own precedent. Nor\nis such double deference necessary to prevent expansion of federal\nhabeas relief to those who rely on “debatable” interpretations or\nextensions of our holdings. Post at 17–18 (opinion of\nThomas, J.). Andrew does not rely on an interpretation or extension\nof this Court’s cases but on a principle this Court itself has\nrelied on over the course of decades. Because the Tenth Circuit nonetheless held that\nno relevant clearly established law existed (a ruling this Court\nreviews de novo ) it never considered whether the state\ncourt’s application of that law was reasonable. On remand, the\nCourt of Appeals should conduct that inquiry in the first instance.\nSpecifically, the question now is whether a fairminded jurist\nreviewing this record could disagree with Andrew that the trial\ncourt’s mistaken admission of irrelevant evidence was so “unduly\nprejudicial” as to render her trial “fundamentally unfair.” Payne , 501 U. S., at 825. The Court of Appeals must ask that question\nseparately for the guilt and sentencing phases. As to each phase,\nit might consider the relevance of the disputed evidence to the\ncharges or sentencing factors, the degree of prejudice Andrew\nsuffered from its introduction, and whether the trial court\nprovided any mitigating instructions. Cf. Romano , 512\nU. S., at 13. The ultimate question is whether a fairminded\njurist could disagree that the evidence “so infected the trial with\nunfairness” as to render the resulting conviction or sentence\n“a denial of due process.” Ibid. *  *  * At the time of the OCCA’s decision, clearly\nestablished law provided that the Due Process Clause forbids the\nintroduction of evidence so unduly prejudicial as to render a\ncriminal trial fundamentally unfair. This Court accordingly grants\nthe petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis , vacates the judgment below, and remands\nthe case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Notes 1 The dissent recites what\nit insists was substantial evidence of Andrew’s guilt, contending\nin the process that this Court “inaccurately portrays” that\nevidence. Post , at 2 (opinion of Thomas, J.). In doing so,\nit prejudges the prejudice analysis by characterizing as fact the\nState’s narrative at trial. That narrative, of course, was hotly\ncontested then and remains so now. For example, the defense\nelicited testimony from multiple witnesses that Andrew knew on the\nday of the murder that she was not the beneficiary on the life\ninsurance policy. The OCCA held that the court also wrongly\nexcluded evidence Andrew argued would cast doubt on the theory that\nshe had staged the shooting, though the OCCA held that exclusion\nwas harmless. Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23,\n¶¶89–92, 164 P.3d 176 , 197. The Court today says nothing about the\nstrength of the evidence against Andrew because the issue of\nprejudice in both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial is\none for the Tenth Circuit to consider on remand. See infra ,\nat 9. Similarly, the dissent asserts that Andrew falsely accuses\nthe prosecution of calling her a “slut puppy” in closing argument. Post , at 7, n. 3 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Whether the\nprosecution quoted something it believed Andrew once said to\nsuggest to the jury that Andrew herself was a “slut puppy,” or\nsimply to recite an alleged abusive phone call, is a question of\nfact for the Tenth Circuit to resolve. 2 The dissent asserts that\nthe OCCA held evidence of Andrew’s “ ‘close personal\nrelationship’ ” with two of her affair partners to be relevant\nbecause it gave credence to testimony that Andrew had\n“ ‘shared with both of these men her hatred for Rob Andrew and\nher wish that he was dead.’ ” Post , at 6 (opinion of\nThomas, J.) (quoting 164 P. 3d, at 192). Andrew never objected\nto evidence that she had a “close personal relationship” with these\nmen. In fact, defense counsel stipulated that she had affairs with\nthem. See, e . g ., Tr. 338 (June 18, 2004) (“We’re not\ncontesting the affair. We have never contested the affair with\nNunley or Higgins”). Andrew’s claim instead concerned the extensive\ntestimony about how she flirted with these men, how she dressed\naround them, and how many times (and where) she had sex with them.\nThat testimony appears to have no bearing on Andrew’s alleged\nexpressions of hatred for her husband. 3 The dissent argues that Estelle v. McGuire , 502 U.S.\n62 (1991), shows otherwise because it left open whether\n“ ‘it is a violation of the due process guaranteed by the\nFourteenth Amendment for evidence that is not relevant to be\nreceived in a criminal trial.’ ” Post , at 16 (opinion\nof Thomas, J.) (quoting Estelle , 502 U. S., at 70). To\nbe sure, this Court did not hold in Payne that the\nintroduction of all irrelevant evidence violates the Due Process\nClause. Payne established, rather, that due process protects\ndefendants from the introduction of evidence so prejudicial as to\naffect the fundamental fairness of their trials. This Court\nsquarely acknowledged that rule in Estelle , explaining that\n“the challenged evidence” at issue there did not warrant relief\nbecause it did not “ ‘so infus[e] the trial with unfairness as\nto deny due process of law.’ ” 502 U. S., at 75 (quoting Lisenba v. California , 314 U.S.\n219 , 228 (1941), and citing Donnelly , 416 U. S., at\n643). In any event, and as recounted below, this Court has\ncontinued to rely on Payne ’s fundamental fairness principle\nsince Estelle .",

TAMIKA WHITE,\nWARDEN on petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the tenth circuit No. 23–6573. Decided January 21, 2025 Per Curiam. An Oklahoma jury convicted Brenda Andrew of\nmurdering her husband, Rob Andrew, and sentenced her to death. The\nState spent significant time at trial introducing evidence about\nAndrew’s sex life and about her failings as a mother and wife, much\nof which it later conceded was irrelevant. In a federal habeas\npetition, Andrew argued that this evidence had been so prejudicial\nas to violate the Due Process Clause.

This\nCourt has accordingly applied Payne ’s framework to a claim\nmuch like Andrew’s: “that the introduction of [prejudicial]\nevidence” at the sentencing phases “violated the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.” Romano v. Oklahoma , 512 U.S.\n1 , 12 (1994). More recently, the Court relied on Payne in the same way that Andrew sought to rely on it here: for the\nproposition that “the Due Process Clause . . . wards off\nthe introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence that would render\nthe trial fundamentally unfair.” Kansas v. Carr , 577 U.S.\n108 , 123 (2016) (quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 825;\ninternal quotation marks and alteration omitted). This Court has\nalso relied on the underlying fundamental fairness principle in the\njury-impartiality context. See Rideau v. Louisiana , 373 U.S.\n723 , 726 (1963); Skilling v. United States , 561 U.S.\n358 , 379 (2010). To the extent that the Court of Appeals thought\nitself constrained by AEDPA to limit Payne to its facts, it\nwas mistaken. General legal principles can constitute clearly\nestablished law for purposes of AEDPA so long as they are holdings\nof this Court. For example, the Eighth Amendment principle that a\nsentence may not be grossly disproportionate to the offense is\n“ ‘clearly established’ under §2554(d)(1),” even though it\narises out of a “thicket of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence” and\nlacks “ ‘precise contours.’ ” Lockyer , 538\nU. S., at 72. Although this Court has not previously relied on Payne to invalidate a conviction for improperly admitted\nprejudicial evidence, moreover, “certain principles are fundamental\nenough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to\napply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt.” White , 572\nU. S., at 427 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado , 541 U.S.\n652 , 666 (2004)); see also Taylor v. Riojas , 592\nU.S. 7, 9 (2020) ( per curiam ) (“ ‘[A] general\nconstitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may\napply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in\nquestion’ ” (quoting Hope v. Pelzer , 536 U.S.\n730 , 741 (2002))). The Court of Appeals thus erred by refusing\neven to consider whether the OCCA unreasonably applied established\ndue process principles to Andrew’s case. The dissent maintains that a reasonable jurist\ncould agree with the Tenth Circuit’s understanding of our\nprecedent. That assertion conflates the deference federal habeas\ncourts must extend to a state court’s “application of ” this\nCourt’s precedent with the federal courts’ independent obligation\nto first identify the relevant “clearly established Federal law.”\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1); Lockyer , 538 U. S.,\nat 71 (identifying clearly established law “[a]s a threshold\nmatter”). A legal principle is clearly established for purposes of\nAEDPA if it is a holding of this Court. White , 572\nU. S., at 419. This Court has no occasion to defer to other\nfederal courts’ erroneous interpretations of its own precedent. Nor\nis such double deference necessary to prevent expansion of federal\nhabeas relief to those who rely on “debatable” interpretations or\nextensions of our holdings. Post at 17–18 (opinion of\nThomas, J.). Andrew does not rely on an interpretation or extension\nof this Court’s cases but on a principle this Court itself has\nrelied on over the course of decades. Because the Tenth Circuit nonetheless held that\nno relevant clearly established law existed (a ruling this Court\nreviews de novo ) it never considered whether the state\ncourt’s application of that law was reasonable. On remand, the\nCourt of Appeals should conduct that inquiry in the first instance.\nSpecifically, the question now is whether a fairminded jurist\nreviewing this record could disagree with Andrew that the trial\ncourt’s mistaken admission of irrelevant evidence was so “unduly\nprejudicial” as to render her trial “fundamentally unfair.” Payne , 501 U. S., at 825. The Court of Appeals must ask that question\nseparately for the guilt and sentencing phases. As to each phase,\nit might consider the relevance of the disputed evidence to the\ncharges or sentencing factors, the degree of prejudice Andrew\nsuffered from its introduction, and whether the trial court\nprovided any mitigating instructions. Cf. Romano , 512\nU. S., at 13. The ultimate question is whether a fairminded\njurist could disagree that the evidence “so infected the trial with\nunfairness” as to render the resulting conviction or sentence\n“a denial of due process.” Ibid. *  *  * At the time of the OCCA’s decision, clearly\nestablished law provided that the Due Process Clause forbids the\nintroduction of evidence so unduly prejudicial as to render a\ncriminal trial fundamentally unfair. This Court accordingly grants\nthe petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis , vacates the judgment below, and remands\nthe case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Notes 1 The dissent recites what\nit insists was substantial evidence of Andrew’s guilt, contending\nin the process that this Court “inaccurately portrays” that\nevidence. Post , at 2 (opinion of Thomas, J.). In doing so,\nit prejudges the prejudice analysis by characterizing as fact the\nState’s narrative at trial. That narrative, of course, was hotly\ncontested then and remains so now. For example, the defense\nelicited testimony from multiple witnesses that Andrew knew on the\nday of the murder that she was not the beneficiary on the life\ninsurance policy. The OCCA held that the court also wrongly\nexcluded evidence Andrew argued would cast doubt on the theory that\nshe had staged the shooting, though the OCCA held that exclusion\nwas harmless. Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23,\n¶¶89–92, 164 P.3d 176 , 197. The Court today says nothing about the\nstrength of the evidence against Andrew because the issue of\nprejudice in both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial is\none for the Tenth Circuit to consider on remand. See infra ,\nat 9. Similarly, the dissent asserts that Andrew falsely accuses\nthe prosecution of calling her a “slut puppy” in closing argument. Post , at 7, n. 3 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Whether the\nprosecution quoted something it believed Andrew once said to\nsuggest to the jury that Andrew herself was a “slut puppy,” or\nsimply to recite an alleged abusive phone call, is a question of\nfact for the Tenth Circuit to resolve. 2 The dissent asserts that\nthe OCCA held evidence of Andrew’s “ ‘close personal\nrelationship’ ” with two of her affair partners to be relevant\nbecause it gave credence to testimony that Andrew had\n“ ‘shared with both of these men her hatred for Rob Andrew and\nher wish that he was dead.’ ” Post , at 6 (opinion of\nThomas, J.) (quoting 164 P. 3d, at 192). Andrew never objected\nto evidence that she had a “close personal relationship” with these\nmen. In fact, defense counsel stipulated that she had affairs with\nthem. See, e . g ., Tr. 338 (June 18, 2004) (“We’re not\ncontesting the affair. We have never contested the affair with\nNunley or Higgins”). Andrew’s claim instead concerned the extensive\ntestimony about how she flirted with these men, how she dressed\naround them, and how many times (and where) she had sex with them.\nThat testimony appears to have no bearing on Andrew’s alleged\nexpressions of hatred for her husband. 3 The dissent argues that Estelle v. McGuire , 502 U.S.\n62 (1991), shows otherwise because it left open whether\n“ ‘it is a violation of the due process guaranteed by the\nFourteenth Amendment for evidence that is not relevant to be\nreceived in a criminal trial.’ ” Post , at 16 (opinion\nof Thomas, J.) (quoting Estelle , 502 U. S., at 70). To\nbe sure, this Court did not hold in Payne that the\nintroduction of all irrelevant evidence violates the Due Process\nClause. Payne established, rather, that due process protects\ndefendants from the introduction of evidence so prejudicial as to\naffect the fundamental fairness of their trials. This Court\nsquarely acknowledged that rule in Estelle , explaining that\n“the challenged evidence” at issue there did not warrant relief\nbecause it did not “ ‘so infus[e] the trial with unfairness as\nto deny due process of law.’ ” 502 U. S., at 75 (quoting Lisenba v. California , 314 U.S.\n219 , 228 (1941), and citing Donnelly , 416 U. S., at\n643). In any event, and as recounted below, this Court has\ncontinued to rely on Payne ’s fundamental fairness principle\nsince Estelle .",

    "fulltext": " SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES BRENDA EVERS ANDREW v. TAMIKA WHITE,\nWARDEN on petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the tenth circuit No. 23–6573. Decided January 21, 2025 Per Curiam. An Oklahoma jury convicted Brenda Andrew of\nmurdering her husband, Rob Andrew, and sentenced her to death. The\nState spent significant time at trial introducing evidence about\nAndrew’s sex life and about her failings as a mother and wife, much\nof which it later conceded was irrelevant. In a federal habeas\npetition, Andrew argued that this evidence had been so prejudicial\nas to violate the Due Process Clause. The Court of Appeals rejected\nthat claim because, it thought, no holding of this Court\nestablished a general rule that the erroneous admission of\nprejudicial evidence could violate due process. That was wrong. By\nthe time of Andrew’s trial, this Court had made clear that when\n“evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it\nrenders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for relief.” Payne v. Tennessee , 501 U.S.\n808 , 825 (1991). I A On November 20, 2001, Rob Andrew was fatally\nshot in his garage. Brenda Andrew, who herself had been shot in the\narm during the incident, told the police that two armed assailants\nhad committed the shooting. Andrew further explained that she had\nseparated from her husband and was now dating James Pavatt, but\nthat she and Rob continued to see each other as they had two\nchildren together. Pavatt and Andrew traveled to Mexico together\nafter Rob Andrew’s death and soon became suspects in his murder.\nEventually, Pavatt confessed to committing the shooting with a\nfriend. Pavatt denied that Andrew had been involved. The State\nthereafter charged both Pavatt and Andrew with capital murder, and\na jury convicted Pavatt and sentenced him to death. At Andrew’s trial, the prosecution sought to\nprove that Andrew had conspired with Pavatt, an insurance agent, to\nmurder her husband for the proceeds of his life insurance policy.\nAmong other things, the prosecution elicited testimony about\nAndrew’s sexual partners reaching back two decades; about the\noutfits she wore to dinner or during grocery runs; about the\nunderwear she packed for vacation; and about how often she had sex\nin her car. At least two of the prosecution’s guilt-phase witnesses\ntook the stand exclusively to testify about Andrew’s provocative\nclothing, and others were asked to comment on whether a good mother\nwould dress or behave the way Andrew had. In its closing statement,\nthe prosecution again invoked these themes, including by displaying\nAndrew’s “thong underwear” to the jury, by reminding the jury of\nAndrew’s alleged affairs during college, and by emphasizing that\nAndrew “had sex on [her husband] over and over and over” while\n“keeping a boyfriend on the side.” Tr. 4103, 4124–4125 (July 12,\n2004). At both the guilt and sentencing phases, prosecutors\ncontrasted Andrew with the victim, whom they asserted had been\n“committed to God.” Id. , at 4124; see also, e.g. , Tr.\n4402 (July 14, 2004) (suggesting nothing could mitigate murder of\nRob Andrew because he just “wanted to love God”).[ 1 ] B The jury convicted Andrew and sentenced her to\ndeath. On appeal, Andrew argued that the introduction\nof irrelevant evidence, including evidence “that she had\nextramarital sexual affairs with two other men,” that she had\n“ ‘come on to’ ” another witness’s sons, and that she had\ndressed provocatively at a restaurant, Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23, ¶¶42–59, 164 P.3d 176 , 190–193, violated Oklahoma law as well as the\nFederal Due Process Clause. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n(OCCA) held that admission of evidence about Andrew’s extramarital\naffairs had been proper because it showed that “[h]er co-defendant\nwas just the last in a long line of men that she seduced.” Id., at 192.[ 2 ] The OCCA\n“struggl[ed],” however, “to find any relevance . . .\nother than to show [Andrew’s] character” for the remaining\nchallenged evidence. Ibid . By now, the State “agree[d] that\nmost of this evidence was irrelevant to any issue in this case.” Ibid. The OCCA nonetheless denied relief on the ground that\nthe trial court’s errors had been harmless. Judge Johnson dissented in part. In his view,\nthe “egregious . . . pattern of introducing evidence that\nha[d] no purpose other than to hammer home that Brenda Andrew is a\nbad wife, a bad mother, and a bad woman . . .\ntrivialize[d] the value of her life in the minds of the jurors.” Id ., at 206–207. He would therefore have vacated her\nsentence. Judge Chapel dissented separately, indicating that he\nwould have reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. Id ., at 208. In federal court, Andrew reiterated her claim\nthat the admission of this evidence rendered the guilt and penalty\nphases of her trial fundamentally unfair, in violation of due\nprocess. 62 F. 4th 1299, 1312–1313 (CA10 2023). The District\nCourt denied relief. A divided Tenth Circuit affirmed because, it\nheld, Andrew had failed to cite “clearly established federal law\ngoverning her claim.” Id ., at 1314. The majority\nacknowledged that Andrew had cited Payne , in which this\nCourt said that the Due Process Clause “provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” when the introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence\n“renders [a] trial fundamentally unfair.” 501 U. S., at 825.\nAccording to the majority, however, that had been a\n“pronouncement,” not a “holding,” of this Court. 62 F. 4th, at\n1314. It therefore concluded Andrew had failed to identify “clearly\nestablished federal law governing her claim,” as required under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Id ., at 1316; 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). As a\nresult, the majority declined to consider whether the OCCA\nunreasonably applied Payne , i . e ., whether a\nfairminded jurist could hold that the admission of irrelevant\nevidence about Andrew’s demeanor as a woman was not so prejudicial\nas to deprive her of a fundamentally fair trial. 62 F. 4th, at 1316\n(“ ‘The absence of clearly established federal law is\ndispositive under §2254(d)(1)’ ” (quoting House v. Hatch , 527 F.3d 1010, 1018 (CA10 2008))). In dissent, Judge Bacharach condemned the\nState’s focus “from start to finish on Ms. Andrew’s sex life,” a\nmove he argued “portrayed Ms. Andrew as a scarlet woman, a modern\nJezebel, sparking distrust based on her loose morals\n. . . plucking away any realistic chance that the jury\nwould seriously consider her version of events.” 62 F. 4th, at\n1366. Judge Bacharach therefore would have held that the\ncombination of evidentiary errors “deprived Ms. Andrew of a\nfundamentally fair trial.” Id ., at 1377. II A federal court may grant habeas relief as to\na claim adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the state\ncourt relied on an unreasonable determination of the facts or\nunreasonably applied “clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by” this Court. 28 U. S. C. §§2254(d)(1)–(2).\nTo show that a state court unreasonably applied clearly established\nfederal law, a petitioner must show that the court unreasonably\napplied “ ‘the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this\nCourt’s decisions.’ ” White v. Woodall , 572 U.S.\n415 , 419 (2014) (quoting Howes v. Fields , 565 U.S.\n499 , 505 (2012)). An unreasonable application, in turn, is one\nwith which no fairminded jurist would agree. Harrington v. Richter , 562 U.S.\n86 , 101 (2011). A When this Court relies on a legal rule or\nprinciple to decide a case, that principle is a “holding” of the\nCourt for purposes of AEDPA. Lockyer v. Andrade , 538 U.S.\n63 , 71–72 (2003) (“[C]learly established Federal law\n. . . is the governing legal principle or principles set\nforth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its\ndecision” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Following these\nprinciples, it is clear that Andrew properly identified clearly\nestablished federal law. In Payne , this Court considered whether\nto overrule a set of prior cases that had categorically barred the\nintroduction of victim impact evidence during the sentencing phases\nof a capital trial. The Court noted that, in many circumstances,\n“victim impact evidence serves entirely legitimate purposes,” 501\nU. S., at 825, even though in others it could be prejudicial.\nIt then concluded that a categorical bar was not necessary to\nprotect against the risk of prejudicial testimony because “the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” against the introduction of evidence “that is so\nunduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair.” Ibid. (citing Darden v. Wainwright , 477 U.S.\n168 , 179–183 (1986)). In light of that protection, the Court\nheld, it could permit victim impact evidence where appropriate\nwithout risking undue prejudice to defendants. 501 U. S., at\n825. In other words, the Court removed one protection for capital\ndefendants (the per se bar on victim impact statements)\nin part because another protection (the Due Process Clause)\nremained available against evidence that is so unduly prejudicial\nthat it renders the trial fundamentally unfair. The legal principle\non which Andrew relies, that the Due Process Clause can in certain\ncases protect against the introduction of unduly prejudicial\nevidence at a criminal trial, was therefore indispensable to the\ndecision in Payne . That means it was a holding of this Court\nfor purposes of AEDPA. Importantly, Payne did not invent due\nprocess protections against unduly prejudicial evidence. The Court\nhad several times before held that prosecutors’ prejudicial or\nmisleading statements violate due process if they render a trial or\ncapital sentencing fundamentally unfair. Donnelly v. DeChristoforo , 416 U.S.\n637 (1974); Caldwell v. Mississippi , 472 U.S.\n320 , 338–340 (1985); Darden , 477 U. S., at 178–183. Payne thus broke little new ground in this respect. By the\ntime of the OCCA’s decision in this case, it was clear that the\nintroduction of unduly prejudicial evidence could, in certain\ncases, violate the Due Process Clause.[ 3 ] B The Court of Appeals nonetheless held that Payne “merely established that the Eighth Amendment did not\nerect a ‘ per se bar’ to the introduction of\nvictim-impact statements in capital cases.” 62 F. 4th, at 1314\n(quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 827). As just explained,\nhowever, Payne expressly relied on the availability of\nrelief under the Due Process Clause to reach that conclusion. This\nCourt has accordingly applied Payne ’s framework to a claim\nmuch like Andrew’s: “that the introduction of [prejudicial]\nevidence” at the sentencing phases “violated the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.” Romano v. Oklahoma , 512 U.S.\n1 , 12 (1994). More recently, the Court relied on Payne in the same way that Andrew sought to rely on it here: for the\nproposition that “the Due Process Clause . . . wards off\nthe introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence that would render\nthe trial fundamentally unfair.” Kansas v. Carr , 577 U.S.\n108 , 123 (2016) (quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 825;\ninternal quotation marks and alteration omitted). This Court has\nalso relied on the underlying fundamental fairness principle in the\njury-impartiality context. See Rideau v. Louisiana , 373 U.S.\n723 , 726 (1963); Skilling v. United States , 561 U.S.\n358 , 379 (2010). To the extent that the Court of Appeals thought\nitself constrained by AEDPA to limit Payne to its facts, it\nwas mistaken.

In a federal habeas\npetition, Andrew argued that this evidence had been so prejudicial\nas to violate the Due Process Clause. The Court of Appeals rejected\nthat claim because, it thought, no holding of this Court\nestablished a general rule that the erroneous admission of\nprejudicial evidence could violate due process. That was wrong. By\nthe time of Andrew’s trial, this Court had made clear that when\n“evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it\nrenders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for relief.” Payne v. Tennessee , 501 U.S.\n808 , 825 (1991). I A On November 20, 2001, Rob Andrew was fatally\nshot in his garage. Brenda Andrew, who herself had been shot in the\narm during the incident, told the police that two armed assailants\nhad committed the shooting. Andrew further explained that she had\nseparated from her husband and was now dating James Pavatt, but\nthat she and Rob continued to see each other as they had two\nchildren together. Pavatt and Andrew traveled to Mexico together\nafter Rob Andrew’s death and soon became suspects in his murder.\nEventually, Pavatt confessed to committing the shooting with a\nfriend. Pavatt denied that Andrew had been involved. The State\nthereafter charged both Pavatt and Andrew with capital murder, and\na jury convicted Pavatt and sentenced him to death. At Andrew’s trial, the prosecution sought to\nprove that Andrew had conspired with Pavatt, an insurance agent, to\nmurder her husband for the proceeds of his life insurance policy.\nAmong other things, the prosecution elicited testimony about\nAndrew’s sexual partners reaching back two decades; about the\noutfits she wore to dinner or during grocery runs; about the\nunderwear she packed for vacation; and about how often she had sex\nin her car. At least two of the prosecution’s guilt-phase witnesses\ntook the stand exclusively to testify about Andrew’s provocative\nclothing, and others were asked to comment on whether a good mother\nwould dress or behave the way Andrew had. In its closing statement,\nthe prosecution again invoked these themes, including by displaying\nAndrew’s “thong underwear” to the jury, by reminding the jury of\nAndrew’s alleged affairs during college, and by emphasizing that\nAndrew “had sex on [her husband] over and over and over” while\n“keeping a boyfriend on the side.” Tr. 4103, 4124–4125 (July 12,\n2004). At both the guilt and sentencing phases, prosecutors\ncontrasted Andrew with the victim, whom they asserted had been\n“committed to God.” Id. , at 4124; see also, e.g. , Tr.\n4402 (July 14, 2004) (suggesting nothing could mitigate murder of\nRob Andrew because he just “wanted to love God”).[ 1 ] B The jury convicted Andrew and sentenced her to\ndeath. On appeal, Andrew argued that the introduction\nof irrelevant evidence, including evidence “that she had\nextramarital sexual affairs with two other men,” that she had\n“ ‘come on to’ ” another witness’s sons, and that she had\ndressed provocatively at a restaurant, Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23, ¶¶42–59, 164 P.3d 176 , 190–193, violated Oklahoma law as well as the\nFederal Due Process Clause. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n(OCCA) held that admission of evidence about Andrew’s extramarital\naffairs had been proper because it showed that “[h]er co-defendant\nwas just the last in a long line of men that she seduced.” Id., at 192.[ 2 ] The OCCA\n“struggl[ed],” however, “to find any relevance . . .\nother than to show [Andrew’s] character” for the remaining\nchallenged evidence. Ibid . By now, the State “agree[d] that\nmost of this evidence was irrelevant to any issue in this case.” Ibid. The OCCA nonetheless denied relief on the ground that\nthe trial court’s errors had been harmless. Judge Johnson dissented in part. In his view,\nthe “egregious . . . pattern of introducing evidence that\nha[d] no purpose other than to hammer home that Brenda Andrew is a\nbad wife, a bad mother, and a bad woman . . .\ntrivialize[d] the value of her life in the minds of the jurors.” Id ., at 206–207. He would therefore have vacated her\nsentence. Judge Chapel dissented separately, indicating that he\nwould have reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. Id ., at 208. In federal court, Andrew reiterated her claim\nthat the admission of this evidence rendered the guilt and penalty\nphases of her trial fundamentally unfair, in violation of due\nprocess. 62 F. 4th 1299, 1312–1313 (CA10 2023). The District\nCourt denied relief. A divided Tenth Circuit affirmed because, it\nheld, Andrew had failed to cite “clearly established federal law\ngoverning her claim.” Id ., at 1314. The majority\nacknowledged that Andrew had cited Payne , in which this\nCourt said that the Due Process Clause “provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” when the introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence\n“renders [a] trial fundamentally unfair.” 501 U. S., at 825.\nAccording to the majority, however, that had been a\n“pronouncement,” not a “holding,” of this Court. 62 F. 4th, at\n1314. It therefore concluded Andrew had failed to identify “clearly\nestablished federal law governing her claim,” as required under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Id ., at 1316; 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). As a\nresult, the majority declined to consider whether the OCCA\nunreasonably applied Payne , i . e ., whether a\nfairminded jurist could hold that the admission of irrelevant\nevidence about Andrew’s demeanor as a woman was not so prejudicial\nas to deprive her of a fundamentally fair trial. 62 F. 4th, at 1316\n(“ ‘The absence of clearly established federal law is\ndispositive under §2254(d)(1)’ ” (quoting House v. Hatch , 527 F.3d 1010, 1018 (CA10 2008))). In dissent, Judge Bacharach condemned the\nState’s focus “from start to finish on Ms. Andrew’s sex life,” a\nmove he argued “portrayed Ms. Andrew as a scarlet woman, a modern\nJezebel, sparking distrust based on her loose morals\n. . . plucking away any realistic chance that the jury\nwould seriously consider her version of events.” 62 F. 4th, at\n1366. Judge Bacharach therefore would have held that the\ncombination of evidentiary errors “deprived Ms. Andrew of a\nfundamentally fair trial.” Id ., at 1377. II A federal court may grant habeas relief as to\na claim adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the state\ncourt relied on an unreasonable determination of the facts or\nunreasonably applied “clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by” this Court. 28 U. S. C. §§2254(d)(1)–(2).\nTo show that a state court unreasonably applied clearly established\nfederal law, a petitioner must show that the court unreasonably\napplied “ ‘the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this\nCourt’s decisions.’ ” White v. Woodall , 572 U.S.\n415 , 419 (2014) (quoting Howes v. Fields , 565 U.S.\n499 , 505 (2012)). An unreasonable application, in turn, is one\nwith which no fairminded jurist would agree. Harrington v. Richter , 562 U.S.\n86 , 101 (2011). A When this Court relies on a legal rule or\nprinciple to decide a case, that principle is a “holding” of the\nCourt for purposes of AEDPA. Lockyer v. Andrade , 538 U.S.\n63 , 71–72 (2003) (“[C]learly established Federal law\n. . . is the governing legal principle or principles set\nforth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its\ndecision” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Following these\nprinciples, it is clear that Andrew properly identified clearly\nestablished federal law. In Payne , this Court considered whether\nto overrule a set of prior cases that had categorically barred the\nintroduction of victim impact evidence during the sentencing phases\nof a capital trial. The Court noted that, in many circumstances,\n“victim impact evidence serves entirely legitimate purposes,” 501\nU. S., at 825, even though in others it could be prejudicial.\nIt then concluded that a categorical bar was not necessary to\nprotect against the risk of prejudicial testimony because “the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” against the introduction of evidence “that is so\nunduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair.” Ibid. (citing Darden v. Wainwright , 477 U.S.\n168 , 179–183 (1986)). In light of that protection, the Court\nheld, it could permit victim impact evidence where appropriate\nwithout risking undue prejudice to defendants. 501 U. S., at\n825. In other words, the Court removed one protection for capital\ndefendants (the per se bar on victim impact statements)\nin part because another protection (the Due Process Clause)\nremained available against evidence that is so unduly prejudicial\nthat it renders the trial fundamentally unfair. The legal principle\non which Andrew relies, that the Due Process Clause can in certain\ncases protect against the introduction of unduly prejudicial\nevidence at a criminal trial, was therefore indispensable to the\ndecision in Payne . That means it was a holding of this Court\nfor purposes of AEDPA. Importantly, Payne did not invent due\nprocess protections against unduly prejudicial evidence. The Court\nhad several times before held that prosecutors’ prejudicial or\nmisleading statements violate due process if they render a trial or\ncapital sentencing fundamentally unfair. Donnelly v. DeChristoforo , 416 U.S.\n637 (1974); Caldwell v. Mississippi , 472 U.S.\n320 , 338–340 (1985); Darden , 477 U. S., at 178–183. Payne thus broke little new ground in this respect. By the\ntime of the OCCA’s decision in this case, it was clear that the\nintroduction of unduly prejudicial evidence could, in certain\ncases, violate the Due Process Clause.[ 3 ] B The Court of Appeals nonetheless held that Payne “merely established that the Eighth Amendment did not\nerect a ‘ per se bar’ to the introduction of\nvictim-impact statements in capital cases.” 62 F. 4th, at 1314\n(quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 827). As just explained,\nhowever, Payne expressly relied on the availability of\nrelief under the Due Process Clause to reach that conclusion. This\nCourt has accordingly applied Payne ’s framework to a claim\nmuch like Andrew’s: “that the introduction of [prejudicial]\nevidence” at the sentencing phases “violated the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.” Romano v. Oklahoma , 512 U.S.\n1 , 12 (1994). More recently, the Court relied on Payne in the same way that Andrew sought to rely on it here: for the\nproposition that “the Due Process Clause . . . wards off\nthe introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence that would render\nthe trial fundamentally unfair.” Kansas v. Carr , 577 U.S.\n108 , 123 (2016) (quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 825;\ninternal quotation marks and alteration omitted). This Court has\nalso relied on the underlying fundamental fairness principle in the\njury-impartiality context. See Rideau v. Louisiana , 373 U.S.\n723 , 726 (1963); Skilling v. United States , 561 U.S.\n358 , 379 (2010). To the extent that the Court of Appeals thought\nitself constrained by AEDPA to limit Payne to its facts, it\nwas mistaken. General legal principles can constitute clearly\nestablished law for purposes of AEDPA so long as they are holdings\nof this Court. For example, the Eighth Amendment principle that a\nsentence may not be grossly disproportionate to the offense is\n“ ‘clearly established’ under §2554(d)(1),” even though it\narises out of a “thicket of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence” and\nlacks “ ‘precise contours.’ ” Lockyer , 538\nU. S., at 72. Although this Court has not previously relied on Payne to invalidate a conviction for improperly admitted\nprejudicial evidence, moreover, “certain principles are fundamental\nenough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to\napply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt.” White , 572\nU. S., at 427 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado , 541 U.S.\n652 , 666 (2004)); see also Taylor v. Riojas , 592\nU.S. 7, 9 (2020) ( per curiam ) (“ ‘[A] general\nconstitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may\napply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in\nquestion’ ” (quoting Hope v. Pelzer , 536 U.S.\n730 , 741 (2002))). The Court of Appeals thus erred by refusing\neven to consider whether the OCCA unreasonably applied established\ndue process principles to Andrew’s case. The dissent maintains that a reasonable jurist\ncould agree with the Tenth Circuit’s understanding of our\nprecedent. That assertion conflates the deference federal habeas\ncourts must extend to a state court’s “application of ” this\nCourt’s precedent with the federal courts’ independent obligation\nto first identify the relevant “clearly established Federal law.”\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1); Lockyer , 538 U. S.,\nat 71 (identifying clearly established law “[a]s a threshold\nmatter”). A legal principle is clearly established for purposes of\nAEDPA if it is a holding of this Court. White , 572\nU. S., at 419. This Court has no occasion to defer to other\nfederal courts’ erroneous interpretations of its own precedent. Nor\nis such double deference necessary to prevent expansion of federal\nhabeas relief to those who rely on “debatable” interpretations or\nextensions of our holdings. Post at 17–18 (opinion of\nThomas, J.). Andrew does not rely on an interpretation or extension\nof this Court’s cases but on a principle this Court itself has\nrelied on over the course of decades. Because the Tenth Circuit nonetheless held that\nno relevant clearly established law existed (a ruling this Court\nreviews de novo ) it never considered whether the state\ncourt’s application of that law was reasonable. On remand, the\nCourt of Appeals should conduct that inquiry in the first instance.\nSpecifically, the question now is whether a fairminded jurist\nreviewing this record could disagree with Andrew that the trial\ncourt’s mistaken admission of irrelevant evidence was so “unduly\nprejudicial” as to render her trial “fundamentally unfair.” Payne , 501 U. S., at 825. The Court of Appeals must ask that question\nseparately for the guilt and sentencing phases. As to each phase,\nit might consider the relevance of the disputed evidence to the\ncharges or sentencing factors, the degree of prejudice Andrew\nsuffered from its introduction, and whether the trial court\nprovided any mitigating instructions. Cf. Romano , 512\nU. S., at 13. The ultimate question is whether a fairminded\njurist could disagree that the evidence “so infected the trial with\nunfairness” as to render the resulting conviction or sentence\n“a denial of due process.” Ibid. *  *  * At the time of the OCCA’s decision, clearly\nestablished law provided that the Due Process Clause forbids the\nintroduction of evidence so unduly prejudicial as to render a\ncriminal trial fundamentally unfair. This Court accordingly grants\nthe petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis , vacates the judgment below, and remands\nthe case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Notes 1 The dissent recites what\nit insists was substantial evidence of Andrew’s guilt, contending\nin the process that this Court “inaccurately portrays” that\nevidence. Post , at 2 (opinion of Thomas, J.). In doing so,\nit prejudges the prejudice analysis by characterizing as fact the\nState’s narrative at trial. That narrative, of course, was hotly\ncontested then and remains so now. For example, the defense\nelicited testimony from multiple witnesses that Andrew knew on the\nday of the murder that she was not the beneficiary on the life\ninsurance policy. The OCCA held that the court also wrongly\nexcluded evidence Andrew argued would cast doubt on the theory that\nshe had staged the shooting, though the OCCA held that exclusion\nwas harmless. Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23,\n¶¶89–92, 164 P.3d 176 , 197. The Court today says nothing about the\nstrength of the evidence against Andrew because the issue of\nprejudice in both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial is\none for the Tenth Circuit to consider on remand. See infra ,\nat 9. Similarly, the dissent asserts that Andrew falsely accuses\nthe prosecution of calling her a “slut puppy” in closing argument. Post , at 7, n. 3 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Whether the\nprosecution quoted something it believed Andrew once said to\nsuggest to the jury that Andrew herself was a “slut puppy,” or\nsimply to recite an alleged abusive phone call, is a question of\nfact for the Tenth Circuit to resolve. 2 The dissent asserts that\nthe OCCA held evidence of Andrew’s “ ‘close personal\nrelationship’ ” with two of her affair partners to be relevant\nbecause it gave credence to testimony that Andrew had\n“ ‘shared with both of these men her hatred for Rob Andrew and\nher wish that he was dead.’ ” Post , at 6 (opinion of\nThomas, J.) (quoting 164 P. 3d, at 192). Andrew never objected\nto evidence that she had a “close personal relationship” with these\nmen. In fact, defense counsel stipulated that she had affairs with\nthem. See, e . g ., Tr. 338 (June 18, 2004) (“We’re not\ncontesting the affair. We have never contested the affair with\nNunley or Higgins”). Andrew’s claim instead concerned the extensive\ntestimony about how she flirted with these men, how she dressed\naround them, and how many times (and where) she had sex with them.\nThat testimony appears to have no bearing on Andrew’s alleged\nexpressions of hatred for her husband. 3 The dissent argues that Estelle v. McGuire , 502 U.S.\n62 (1991), shows otherwise because it left open whether\n“ ‘it is a violation of the due process guaranteed by the\nFourteenth Amendment for evidence that is not relevant to be\nreceived in a criminal trial.’ ” Post , at 16 (opinion\nof Thomas, J.) (quoting Estelle , 502 U. S., at 70). To\nbe sure, this Court did not hold in Payne that the\nintroduction of all irrelevant evidence violates the Due Process\nClause. Payne established, rather, that due process protects\ndefendants from the introduction of evidence so prejudicial as to\naffect the fundamental fairness of their trials. This Court\nsquarely acknowledged that rule in Estelle , explaining that\n“the challenged evidence” at issue there did not warrant relief\nbecause it did not “ ‘so infus[e] the trial with unfairness as\nto deny due process of law.’ ” 502 U. S., at 75 (quoting Lisenba v. California , 314 U.S.\n219 , 228 (1941), and citing Donnelly , 416 U. S., at\n643). In any event, and as recounted below, this Court has\ncontinued to rely on Payne ’s fundamental fairness principle\nsince Estelle .",

By the\ntime of the OCCA’s decision in this case, it was clear that the\nintroduction of unduly prejudicial evidence could, in certain\ncases, violate the Due Process Clause.[ 3 ] B The Court of Appeals nonetheless held that Payne “merely established that the Eighth Amendment did not\nerect a ‘ per se bar’ to the introduction of\nvictim-impact statements in capital cases.” 62 F. 4th, at 1314\n(quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 827). As just explained,\nhowever, Payne expressly relied on the availability of\nrelief under the Due Process Clause to reach that conclusion. This\nCourt has accordingly applied Payne ’s framework to a claim\nmuch like Andrew’s: “that the introduction of [prejudicial]\nevidence” at the sentencing phases “violated the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.” Romano v. Oklahoma , 512 U.S.\n1 , 12 (1994). More recently, the Court relied on Payne in the same way that Andrew sought to rely on it here: for the\nproposition that “the Due Process Clause . . . wards off\nthe introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence that would render\nthe trial fundamentally unfair.” Kansas v. Carr , 577 U.S.\n108 , 123 (2016) (quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 825;\ninternal quotation marks and alteration omitted). This Court has\nalso relied on the underlying fundamental fairness principle in the\njury-impartiality context. See Rideau v. Louisiana , 373 U.S.\n723 , 726 (1963); Skilling v. United States , 561 U.S.\n358 , 379 (2010). To the extent that the Court of Appeals thought\nitself constrained by AEDPA to limit Payne to its facts, it\nwas mistaken. General legal principles can constitute clearly\nestablished law for purposes of AEDPA so long as they are holdings\nof this Court. For example, the Eighth Amendment principle that a\nsentence may not be grossly disproportionate to the offense is\n“ ‘clearly established’ under §2554(d)(1),” even though it\narises out of a “thicket of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence” and\nlacks “ ‘precise contours.’ ” Lockyer , 538\nU. S., at 72. Although this Court has not previously relied on Payne to invalidate a conviction for improperly admitted\nprejudicial evidence, moreover, “certain principles are fundamental\nenough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to\napply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt.” White , 572\nU. S., at 427 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado , 541 U.S.\n652 , 666 (2004)); see also Taylor v. Riojas , 592\nU.S. 7, 9 (2020) ( per curiam ) (“ ‘[A] general\nconstitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may\napply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in\nquestion’ ” (quoting Hope v. Pelzer , 536 U.S.\n730 , 741 (2002))). The Court of Appeals thus erred by refusing\neven to consider whether the OCCA unreasonably applied established\ndue process principles to Andrew’s case. The dissent maintains that a reasonable jurist\ncould agree with the Tenth Circuit’s understanding of our\nprecedent. That assertion conflates the deference federal habeas\ncourts must extend to a state court’s “application of ” this\nCourt’s precedent with the federal courts’ independent obligation\nto first identify the relevant “clearly established Federal law.”\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1); Lockyer , 538 U. S.,\nat 71 (identifying clearly established law “[a]s a threshold\nmatter”). A legal principle is clearly established for purposes of\nAEDPA if it is a holding of this Court. White , 572\nU. S., at 419. This Court has no occasion to defer to other\nfederal courts’ erroneous interpretations of its own precedent. Nor\nis such double deference necessary to prevent expansion of federal\nhabeas relief to those who rely on “debatable” interpretations or\nextensions of our holdings. Post at 17–18 (opinion of\nThomas, J.). Andrew does not rely on an interpretation or extension\nof this Court’s cases but on a principle this Court itself has\nrelied on over the course of decades. Because the Tenth Circuit nonetheless held that\nno relevant clearly established law existed (a ruling this Court\nreviews de novo ) it never considered whether the state\ncourt’s application of that law was reasonable. On remand, the\nCourt of Appeals should conduct that inquiry in the first instance.\nSpecifically, the question now is whether a fairminded jurist\nreviewing this record could disagree with Andrew that the trial\ncourt’s mistaken admission of irrelevant evidence was so “unduly\nprejudicial” as to render her trial “fundamentally unfair.” Payne , 501 U. S., at 825. The Court of Appeals must ask that question\nseparately for the guilt and sentencing phases. As to each phase,\nit might consider the relevance of the disputed evidence to the\ncharges or sentencing factors, the degree of prejudice Andrew\nsuffered from its introduction, and whether the trial court\nprovided any mitigating instructions. Cf. Romano , 512\nU. S., at 13. The ultimate question is whether a fairminded\njurist could disagree that the evidence “so infected the trial with\nunfairness” as to render the resulting conviction or sentence\n“a denial of due process.” Ibid. *  *  * At the time of the OCCA’s decision, clearly\nestablished law provided that the Due Process Clause forbids the\nintroduction of evidence so unduly prejudicial as to render a\ncriminal trial fundamentally unfair. This Court accordingly grants\nthe petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis , vacates the judgment below, and remands\nthe case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Notes 1 The dissent recites what\nit insists was substantial evidence of Andrew’s guilt, contending\nin the process that this Court “inaccurately portrays” that\nevidence. Post , at 2 (opinion of Thomas, J.). In doing so,\nit prejudges the prejudice analysis by characterizing as fact the\nState’s narrative at trial. That narrative, of course, was hotly\ncontested then and remains so now. For example, the defense\nelicited testimony from multiple witnesses that Andrew knew on the\nday of the murder that she was not the beneficiary on the life\ninsurance policy. The OCCA held that the court also wrongly\nexcluded evidence Andrew argued would cast doubt on the theory that\nshe had staged the shooting, though the OCCA held that exclusion\nwas harmless. Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23,\n¶¶89–92, 164 P.3d 176 , 197. The Court today says nothing about the\nstrength of the evidence against Andrew because the issue of\nprejudice in both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial is\none for the Tenth Circuit to consider on remand. See infra ,\nat 9. Similarly, the dissent asserts that Andrew falsely accuses\nthe prosecution of calling her a “slut puppy” in closing argument. Post , at 7, n. 3 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Whether the\nprosecution quoted something it believed Andrew once said to\nsuggest to the jury that Andrew herself was a “slut puppy,” or\nsimply to recite an alleged abusive phone call, is a question of\nfact for the Tenth Circuit to resolve. 2 The dissent asserts that\nthe OCCA held evidence of Andrew’s “ ‘close personal\nrelationship’ ” with two of her affair partners to be relevant\nbecause it gave credence to testimony that Andrew had\n“ ‘shared with both of these men her hatred for Rob Andrew and\nher wish that he was dead.’ ” Post , at 6 (opinion of\nThomas, J.) (quoting 164 P. 3d, at 192). Andrew never objected\nto evidence that she had a “close personal relationship” with these\nmen. In fact, defense counsel stipulated that she had affairs with\nthem. See, e . g ., Tr. 338 (June 18, 2004) (“We’re not\ncontesting the affair. We have never contested the affair with\nNunley or Higgins”). Andrew’s claim instead concerned the extensive\ntestimony about how she flirted with these men, how she dressed\naround them, and how many times (and where) she had sex with them.\nThat testimony appears to have no bearing on Andrew’s alleged\nexpressions of hatred for her husband. 3 The dissent argues that Estelle v. McGuire , 502 U.S.\n62 (1991), shows otherwise because it left open whether\n“ ‘it is a violation of the due process guaranteed by the\nFourteenth Amendment for evidence that is not relevant to be\nreceived in a criminal trial.’ ” Post , at 16 (opinion\nof Thomas, J.) (quoting Estelle , 502 U. S., at 70). To\nbe sure, this Court did not hold in Payne that the\nintroduction of all irrelevant evidence violates the Due Process\nClause. Payne established, rather, that due process protects\ndefendants from the introduction of evidence so prejudicial as to\naffect the fundamental fairness of their trials. This Court\nsquarely acknowledged that rule in Estelle , explaining that\n“the challenged evidence” at issue there did not warrant relief\nbecause it did not “ ‘so infus[e] the trial with unfairness as\nto deny due process of law.’ ” 502 U. S., at 75 (quoting Lisenba v. California , 314 U.S.\n219 , 228 (1941), and citing Donnelly , 416 U. S., at\n643). In any event, and as recounted below, this Court has\ncontinued to rely on Payne ’s fundamental fairness principle\nsince Estelle .",

    "fulltext": " SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES BRENDA EVERS ANDREW v. TAMIKA WHITE,\nWARDEN on petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the tenth circuit No. 23–6573. Decided January 21, 2025 Per Curiam. An Oklahoma jury convicted Brenda Andrew of\nmurdering her husband, Rob Andrew, and sentenced her to death. The\nState spent significant time at trial introducing evidence about\nAndrew’s sex life and about her failings as a mother and wife, much\nof which it later conceded was irrelevant. In a federal habeas\npetition, Andrew argued that this evidence had been so prejudicial\nas to violate the Due Process Clause. The Court of Appeals rejected\nthat claim because, it thought, no holding of this Court\nestablished a general rule that the erroneous admission of\nprejudicial evidence could violate due process. That was wrong. By\nthe time of Andrew’s trial, this Court had made clear that when\n“evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it\nrenders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for relief.” Payne v. Tennessee , 501 U.S.\n808 , 825 (1991). I A On November 20, 2001, Rob Andrew was fatally\nshot in his garage. Brenda Andrew, who herself had been shot in the\narm during the incident, told the police that two armed assailants\nhad committed the shooting. Andrew further explained that she had\nseparated from her husband and was now dating James Pavatt, but\nthat she and Rob continued to see each other as they had two\nchildren together. Pavatt and Andrew traveled to Mexico together\nafter Rob Andrew’s death and soon became suspects in his murder.\nEventually, Pavatt confessed to committing the shooting with a\nfriend. Pavatt denied that Andrew had been involved. The State\nthereafter charged both Pavatt and Andrew with capital murder, and\na jury convicted Pavatt and sentenced him to death. At Andrew’s trial, the prosecution sought to\nprove that Andrew had conspired with Pavatt, an insurance agent, to\nmurder her husband for the proceeds of his life insurance policy.\nAmong other things, the prosecution elicited testimony about\nAndrew’s sexual partners reaching back two decades; about the\noutfits she wore to dinner or during grocery runs; about the\nunderwear she packed for vacation; and about how often she had sex\nin her car. At least two of the prosecution’s guilt-phase witnesses\ntook the stand exclusively to testify about Andrew’s provocative\nclothing, and others were asked to comment on whether a good mother\nwould dress or behave the way Andrew had. In its closing statement,\nthe prosecution again invoked these themes, including by displaying\nAndrew’s “thong underwear” to the jury, by reminding the jury of\nAndrew’s alleged affairs during college, and by emphasizing that\nAndrew “had sex on [her husband] over and over and over” while\n“keeping a boyfriend on the side.” Tr. 4103, 4124–4125 (July 12,\n2004). At both the guilt and sentencing phases, prosecutors\ncontrasted Andrew with the victim, whom they asserted had been\n“committed to God.” Id. , at 4124; see also, e.g. , Tr.\n4402 (July 14, 2004) (suggesting nothing could mitigate murder of\nRob Andrew because he just “wanted to love God”).[ 1 ] B The jury convicted Andrew and sentenced her to\ndeath. On appeal, Andrew argued that the introduction\nof irrelevant evidence, including evidence “that she had\nextramarital sexual affairs with two other men,” that she had\n“ ‘come on to’ ” another witness’s sons, and that she had\ndressed provocatively at a restaurant, Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23, ¶¶42–59, 164 P.3d 176 , 190–193, violated Oklahoma law as well as the\nFederal Due Process Clause. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n(OCCA) held that admission of evidence about Andrew’s extramarital\naffairs had been proper because it showed that “[h]er co-defendant\nwas just the last in a long line of men that she seduced.” Id., at 192.[ 2 ] The OCCA\n“struggl[ed],” however, “to find any relevance . . .\nother than to show [Andrew’s] character” for the remaining\nchallenged evidence. Ibid . By now, the State “agree[d] that\nmost of this evidence was irrelevant to any issue in this case.” Ibid. The OCCA nonetheless denied relief on the ground that\nthe trial court’s errors had been harmless. Judge Johnson dissented in part. In his view,\nthe “egregious . . . pattern of introducing evidence that\nha[d] no purpose other than to hammer home that Brenda Andrew is a\nbad wife, a bad mother, and a bad woman . . .\ntrivialize[d] the value of her life in the minds of the jurors.” Id ., at 206–207. He would therefore have vacated her\nsentence. Judge Chapel dissented separately, indicating that he\nwould have reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. Id ., at 208. In federal court, Andrew reiterated her claim\nthat the admission of this evidence rendered the guilt and penalty\nphases of her trial fundamentally unfair, in violation of due\nprocess. 62 F. 4th 1299, 1312–1313 (CA10 2023). The District\nCourt denied relief. A divided Tenth Circuit affirmed because, it\nheld, Andrew had failed to cite “clearly established federal law\ngoverning her claim.” Id ., at 1314. The majority\nacknowledged that Andrew had cited Payne , in which this\nCourt said that the Due Process Clause “provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” when the introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence\n“renders [a] trial fundamentally unfair.” 501 U. S., at 825.\nAccording to the majority, however, that had been a\n“pronouncement,” not a “holding,” of this Court. 62 F. 4th, at\n1314. It therefore concluded Andrew had failed to identify “clearly\nestablished federal law governing her claim,” as required under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Id ., at 1316; 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). As a\nresult, the majority declined to consider whether the OCCA\nunreasonably applied Payne , i . e ., whether a\nfairminded jurist could hold that the admission of irrelevant\nevidence about Andrew’s demeanor as a woman was not so prejudicial\nas to deprive her of a fundamentally fair trial. 62 F. 4th, at 1316\n(“ ‘The absence of clearly established federal law is\ndispositive under §2254(d)(1)’ ” (quoting House v. Hatch , 527 F.3d 1010, 1018 (CA10 2008))). In dissent, Judge Bacharach condemned the\nState’s focus “from start to finish on Ms. Andrew’s sex life,” a\nmove he argued “portrayed Ms. Andrew as a scarlet woman, a modern\nJezebel, sparking distrust based on her loose morals\n. . . plucking away any realistic chance that the jury\nwould seriously consider her version of events.” 62 F. 4th, at\n1366. Judge Bacharach therefore would have held that the\ncombination of evidentiary errors “deprived Ms. Andrew of a\nfundamentally fair trial.” Id ., at 1377. II A federal court may grant habeas relief as to\na claim adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the state\ncourt relied on an unreasonable determination of the facts or\nunreasonably applied “clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by” this Court. 28 U. S. C. §§2254(d)(1)–(2).\nTo show that a state court unreasonably applied clearly established\nfederal law, a petitioner must show that the court unreasonably\napplied “ ‘the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this\nCourt’s decisions.’ ” White v. Woodall , 572 U.S.\n415 , 419 (2014) (quoting Howes v. Fields , 565 U.S.\n499 , 505 (2012)). An unreasonable application, in turn, is one\nwith which no fairminded jurist would agree. Harrington v. Richter , 562 U.S.\n86 , 101 (2011). A When this Court relies on a legal rule or\nprinciple to decide a case, that principle is a “holding” of the\nCourt for purposes of AEDPA. Lockyer v. Andrade , 538 U.S.\n63 , 71–72 (2003) (“[C]learly established Federal law\n. . . is the governing legal principle or principles set\nforth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its\ndecision” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Following these\nprinciples, it is clear that Andrew properly identified clearly\nestablished federal law. In Payne , this Court considered whether\nto overrule a set of prior cases that had categorically barred the\nintroduction of victim impact evidence during the sentencing phases\nof a capital trial. The Court noted that, in many circumstances,\n“victim impact evidence serves entirely legitimate purposes,” 501\nU. S., at 825, even though in others it could be prejudicial.\nIt then concluded that a categorical bar was not necessary to\nprotect against the risk of prejudicial testimony because “the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” against the introduction of evidence “that is so\nunduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair.” Ibid. (citing Darden v. Wainwright , 477 U.S.\n168 , 179–183 (1986)). In light of that protection, the Court\nheld, it could permit victim impact evidence where appropriate\nwithout risking undue prejudice to defendants. 501 U. S., at\n825. In other words, the Court removed one protection for capital\ndefendants (the per se bar on victim impact statements)\nin part because another protection (the Due Process Clause)\nremained available against evidence that is so unduly prejudicial\nthat it renders the trial fundamentally unfair. The legal principle\non which Andrew relies, that the Due Process Clause can in certain\ncases protect against the introduction of unduly prejudicial\nevidence at a criminal trial, was therefore indispensable to the\ndecision in Payne . That means it was a holding of this Court\nfor purposes of AEDPA. Importantly, Payne did not invent due\nprocess protections against unduly prejudicial evidence. The Court\nhad several times before held that prosecutors’ prejudicial or\nmisleading statements violate due process if they render a trial or\ncapital sentencing fundamentally unfair. Donnelly v. DeChristoforo , 416 U.S.\n637 (1974); Caldwell v. Mississippi , 472 U.S.\n320 , 338–340 (1985); Darden , 477 U. S., at 178–183. Payne thus broke little new ground in this respect. By the\ntime of the OCCA’s decision in this case, it was clear that the\nintroduction of unduly prejudicial evidence could, in certain\ncases, violate the Due Process Clause.[ 3 ] B The Court of Appeals nonetheless held that Payne “merely established that the Eighth Amendment did not\nerect a ‘ per se bar’ to the introduction of\nvictim-impact statements in capital cases.” 62 F. 4th, at 1314\n(quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 827). As just explained,\nhowever, Payne expressly relied on the availability of\nrelief under the Due Process Clause to reach that conclusion. This\nCourt has accordingly applied Payne ’s framework to a claim\nmuch like Andrew’s: “that the introduction of [prejudicial]\nevidence” at the sentencing phases “violated the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.” Romano v. Oklahoma , 512 U.S.\n1 , 12 (1994).

Carr , 577 U.S.\n108 , 123 (2016) (quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 825;\ninternal quotation marks and alteration omitted). This Court has\nalso relied on the underlying fundamental fairness principle in the\njury-impartiality context. See Rideau v. Louisiana , 373 U.S.\n723 , 726 (1963); Skilling v.

TAMIKA WHITE,\nWARDEN on petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the tenth circuit No. 23–6573. Decided January 21, 2025 Per Curiam. An Oklahoma jury convicted Brenda Andrew of\nmurdering her husband, Rob Andrew, and sentenced her to death. The\nState spent significant time at trial introducing evidence about\nAndrew’s sex life and about her failings as a mother and wife, much\nof which it later conceded was irrelevant. In a federal habeas\npetition, Andrew argued that this evidence had been so prejudicial\nas to violate the Due Process Clause. The Court of Appeals rejected\nthat claim because, it thought, no holding of this Court\nestablished a general rule that the erroneous admission of\nprejudicial evidence could violate due process. That was wrong. By\nthe time of Andrew’s trial, this Court had made clear that when\n“evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it\nrenders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for relief.” Payne v. Tennessee , 501 U.S.\n808 , 825 (1991). I A On November 20, 2001, Rob Andrew was fatally\nshot in his garage. Brenda Andrew, who herself had been shot in the\narm during the incident, told the police that two armed assailants\nhad committed the shooting. Andrew further explained that she had\nseparated from her husband and was now dating James Pavatt, but\nthat she and Rob continued to see each other as they had two\nchildren together. Pavatt and Andrew traveled to Mexico together\nafter Rob Andrew’s death and soon became suspects in his murder.\nEventually, Pavatt confessed to committing the shooting with a\nfriend. Pavatt denied that Andrew had been involved. The State\nthereafter charged both Pavatt and Andrew with capital murder, and\na jury convicted Pavatt and sentenced him to death. At Andrew’s trial, the prosecution sought to\nprove that Andrew had conspired with Pavatt, an insurance agent, to\nmurder her husband for the proceeds of his life insurance policy.\nAmong other things, the prosecution elicited testimony about\nAndrew’s sexual partners reaching back two decades; about the\noutfits she wore to dinner or during grocery runs; about the\nunderwear she packed for vacation; and about how often she had sex\nin her car. At least two of the prosecution’s guilt-phase witnesses\ntook the stand exclusively to testify about Andrew’s provocative\nclothing, and others were asked to comment on whether a good mother\nwould dress or behave the way Andrew had. In its closing statement,\nthe prosecution again invoked these themes, including by displaying\nAndrew’s “thong underwear” to the jury, by reminding the jury of\nAndrew’s alleged affairs during college, and by emphasizing that\nAndrew “had sex on [her husband] over and over and over” while\n“keeping a boyfriend on the side.” Tr. 4103, 4124–4125 (July 12,\n2004). At both the guilt and sentencing phases, prosecutors\ncontrasted Andrew with the victim, whom they asserted had been\n“committed to God.” Id. , at 4124; see also, e.g. , Tr.\n4402 (July 14, 2004) (suggesting nothing could mitigate murder of\nRob Andrew because he just “wanted to love God”).[ 1 ] B The jury convicted Andrew and sentenced her to\ndeath. On appeal, Andrew argued that the introduction\nof irrelevant evidence, including evidence “that she had\nextramarital sexual affairs with two other men,” that she had\n“ ‘come on to’ ” another witness’s sons, and that she had\ndressed provocatively at a restaurant, Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23, ¶¶42–59, 164 P.3d 176 , 190–193, violated Oklahoma law as well as the\nFederal Due Process Clause. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n(OCCA) held that admission of evidence about Andrew’s extramarital\naffairs had been proper because it showed that “[h]er co-defendant\nwas just the last in a long line of men that she seduced.” Id., at 192.[ 2 ] The OCCA\n“struggl[ed],” however, “to find any relevance . . .\nother than to show [Andrew’s] character” for the remaining\nchallenged evidence. Ibid . By now, the State “agree[d] that\nmost of this evidence was irrelevant to any issue in this case.” Ibid. The OCCA nonetheless denied relief on the ground that\nthe trial court’s errors had been harmless. Judge Johnson dissented in part. In his view,\nthe “egregious . . . pattern of introducing evidence that\nha[d] no purpose other than to hammer home that Brenda Andrew is a\nbad wife, a bad mother, and a bad woman . . .\ntrivialize[d] the value of her life in the minds of the jurors.” Id ., at 206–207. He would therefore have vacated her\nsentence. Judge Chapel dissented separately, indicating that he\nwould have reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. Id ., at 208. In federal court, Andrew reiterated her claim\nthat the admission of this evidence rendered the guilt and penalty\nphases of her trial fundamentally unfair, in violation of due\nprocess. 62 F. 4th 1299, 1312–1313 (CA10 2023). The District\nCourt denied relief. A divided Tenth Circuit affirmed because, it\nheld, Andrew had failed to cite “clearly established federal law\ngoverning her claim.” Id ., at 1314. The majority\nacknowledged that Andrew had cited Payne , in which this\nCourt said that the Due Process Clause “provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” when the introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence\n“renders [a] trial fundamentally unfair.” 501 U. S., at 825.\nAccording to the majority, however, that had been a\n“pronouncement,” not a “holding,” of this Court. 62 F. 4th, at\n1314. It therefore concluded Andrew had failed to identify “clearly\nestablished federal law governing her claim,” as required under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Id ., at 1316; 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). As a\nresult, the majority declined to consider whether the OCCA\nunreasonably applied Payne , i . e ., whether a\nfairminded jurist could hold that the admission of irrelevant\nevidence about Andrew’s demeanor as a woman was not so prejudicial\nas to deprive her of a fundamentally fair trial. 62 F. 4th, at 1316\n(“ ‘The absence of clearly established federal law is\ndispositive under §2254(d)(1)’ ” (quoting House v. Hatch , 527 F.3d 1010, 1018 (CA10 2008))). In dissent, Judge Bacharach condemned the\nState’s focus “from start to finish on Ms. Andrew’s sex life,” a\nmove he argued “portrayed Ms. Andrew as a scarlet woman, a modern\nJezebel, sparking distrust based on her loose morals\n. . . plucking away any realistic chance that the jury\nwould seriously consider her version of events.” 62 F. 4th, at\n1366. Judge Bacharach therefore would have held that the\ncombination of evidentiary errors “deprived Ms. Andrew of a\nfundamentally fair trial.” Id ., at 1377. II A federal court may grant habeas relief as to\na claim adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the state\ncourt relied on an unreasonable determination of the facts or\nunreasonably applied “clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by” this Court. 28 U. S. C. §§2254(d)(1)–(2).\nTo show that a state court unreasonably applied clearly established\nfederal law, a petitioner must show that the court unreasonably\napplied “ ‘the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this\nCourt’s decisions.’ ” White v. Woodall , 572 U.S.\n415 , 419 (2014) (quoting Howes v. Fields , 565 U.S.\n499 , 505 (2012)). An unreasonable application, in turn, is one\nwith which no fairminded jurist would agree. Harrington v. Richter , 562 U.S.\n86 , 101 (2011). A When this Court relies on a legal rule or\nprinciple to decide a case, that principle is a “holding” of the\nCourt for purposes of AEDPA. Lockyer v. Andrade , 538 U.S.\n63 , 71–72 (2003) (“[C]learly established Federal law\n. . . is the governing legal principle or principles set\nforth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its\ndecision” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Following these\nprinciples, it is clear that Andrew properly identified clearly\nestablished federal law. In Payne , this Court considered whether\nto overrule a set of prior cases that had categorically barred the\nintroduction of victim impact evidence during the sentencing phases\nof a capital trial. The Court noted that, in many circumstances,\n“victim impact evidence serves entirely legitimate purposes,” 501\nU. S., at 825, even though in others it could be prejudicial.\nIt then concluded that a categorical bar was not necessary to\nprotect against the risk of prejudicial testimony because “the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” against the introduction of evidence “that is so\nunduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair.” Ibid. (citing Darden v. Wainwright , 477 U.S.\n168 , 179–183 (1986)). In light of that protection, the Court\nheld, it could permit victim impact evidence where appropriate\nwithout risking undue prejudice to defendants. 501 U. S., at\n825. In other words, the Court removed one protection for capital\ndefendants (the per se bar on victim impact statements)\nin part because another protection (the Due Process Clause)\nremained available against evidence that is so unduly prejudicial\nthat it renders the trial fundamentally unfair. The legal principle\non which Andrew relies, that the Due Process Clause can in certain\ncases protect against the introduction of unduly prejudicial\nevidence at a criminal trial, was therefore indispensable to the\ndecision in Payne . That means it was a holding of this Court\nfor purposes of AEDPA. Importantly, Payne did not invent due\nprocess protections against unduly prejudicial evidence. The Court\nhad several times before held that prosecutors’ prejudicial or\nmisleading statements violate due process if they render a trial or\ncapital sentencing fundamentally unfair. Donnelly v. DeChristoforo , 416 U.S.\n637 (1974); Caldwell v. Mississippi , 472 U.S.\n320 , 338–340 (1985); Darden , 477 U. S., at 178–183. Payne thus broke little new ground in this respect. By the\ntime of the OCCA’s decision in this case, it was clear that the\nintroduction of unduly prejudicial evidence could, in certain\ncases, violate the Due Process Clause.[ 3 ] B The Court of Appeals nonetheless held that Payne “merely established that the Eighth Amendment did not\nerect a ‘ per se bar’ to the introduction of\nvictim-impact statements in capital cases.” 62 F. 4th, at 1314\n(quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 827). As just explained,\nhowever, Payne expressly relied on the availability of\nrelief under the Due Process Clause to reach that conclusion. This\nCourt has accordingly applied Payne ’s framework to a claim\nmuch like Andrew’s: “that the introduction of [prejudicial]\nevidence” at the sentencing phases “violated the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.” Romano v. Oklahoma , 512 U.S.\n1 , 12 (1994). More recently, the Court relied on Payne in the same way that Andrew sought to rely on it here: for the\nproposition that “the Due Process Clause . . . wards off\nthe introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence that would render\nthe trial fundamentally unfair.” Kansas v. Carr , 577 U.S.\n108 , 123 (2016) (quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 825;\ninternal quotation marks and alteration omitted). This Court has\nalso relied on the underlying fundamental fairness principle in the\njury-impartiality context. See Rideau v. Louisiana , 373 U.S.\n723 , 726 (1963); Skilling v. United States , 561 U.S.\n358 , 379 (2010). To the extent that the Court of Appeals thought\nitself constrained by AEDPA to limit Payne to its facts, it\nwas mistaken. General legal principles can constitute clearly\nestablished law for purposes of AEDPA so long as they are holdings\nof this Court. For example, the Eighth Amendment principle that a\nsentence may not be grossly disproportionate to the offense is\n“ ‘clearly established’ under §2554(d)(1),” even though it\narises out of a “thicket of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence” and\nlacks “ ‘precise contours.’ ” Lockyer , 538\nU. S., at 72. Although this Court has not previously relied on Payne to invalidate a conviction for improperly admitted\nprejudicial evidence, moreover, “certain principles are fundamental\nenough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to\napply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt.” White , 572\nU. S., at 427 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado , 541 U.S.\n652 , 666 (2004)); see also Taylor v. Riojas , 592\nU.S. 7, 9 (2020) ( per curiam ) (“ ‘[A] general\nconstitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may\napply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in\nquestion’ ” (quoting Hope v. Pelzer , 536 U.S.\n730 , 741 (2002))). The Court of Appeals thus erred by refusing\neven to consider whether the OCCA unreasonably applied established\ndue process principles to Andrew’s case. The dissent maintains that a reasonable jurist\ncould agree with the Tenth Circuit’s understanding of our\nprecedent. That assertion conflates the deference federal habeas\ncourts must extend to a state court’s “application of ” this\nCourt’s precedent with the federal courts’ independent obligation\nto first identify the relevant “clearly established Federal law.”\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1); Lockyer , 538 U. S.,\nat 71 (identifying clearly established law “[a]s a threshold\nmatter”). A legal principle is clearly established for purposes of\nAEDPA if it is a holding of this Court. White , 572\nU. S., at 419. This Court has no occasion to defer to other\nfederal courts’ erroneous interpretations of its own precedent. Nor\nis such double deference necessary to prevent expansion of federal\nhabeas relief to those who rely on “debatable” interpretations or\nextensions of our holdings. Post at 17–18 (opinion of\nThomas, J.). Andrew does not rely on an interpretation or extension\nof this Court’s cases but on a principle this Court itself has\nrelied on over the course of decades. Because the Tenth Circuit nonetheless held that\nno relevant clearly established law existed (a ruling this Court\nreviews de novo ) it never considered whether the state\ncourt’s application of that law was reasonable. On remand, the\nCourt of Appeals should conduct that inquiry in the first instance.\nSpecifically, the question now is whether a fairminded jurist\nreviewing this record could disagree with Andrew that the trial\ncourt’s mistaken admission of irrelevant evidence was so “unduly\nprejudicial” as to render her trial “fundamentally unfair.” Payne , 501 U. S., at 825. The Court of Appeals must ask that question\nseparately for the guilt and sentencing phases. As to each phase,\nit might consider the relevance of the disputed evidence to the\ncharges or sentencing factors, the degree of prejudice Andrew\nsuffered from its introduction, and whether the trial court\nprovided any mitigating instructions. Cf. Romano , 512\nU. S., at 13. The ultimate question is whether a fairminded\njurist could disagree that the evidence “so infected the trial with\nunfairness” as to render the resulting conviction or sentence\n“a denial of due process.” Ibid. *  *  * At the time of the OCCA’s decision, clearly\nestablished law provided that the Due Process Clause forbids the\nintroduction of evidence so unduly prejudicial as to render a\ncriminal trial fundamentally unfair. This Court accordingly grants\nthe petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis , vacates the judgment below, and remands\nthe case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Notes 1 The dissent recites what\nit insists was substantial evidence of Andrew’s guilt, contending\nin the process that this Court “inaccurately portrays” that\nevidence. Post , at 2 (opinion of Thomas, J.). In doing so,\nit prejudges the prejudice analysis by characterizing as fact the\nState’s narrative at trial. That narrative, of course, was hotly\ncontested then and remains so now. For example, the defense\nelicited testimony from multiple witnesses that Andrew knew on the\nday of the murder that she was not the beneficiary on the life\ninsurance policy. The OCCA held that the court also wrongly\nexcluded evidence Andrew argued would cast doubt on the theory that\nshe had staged the shooting, though the OCCA held that exclusion\nwas harmless. Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23,\n¶¶89–92, 164 P.3d 176 , 197. The Court today says nothing about the\nstrength of the evidence against Andrew because the issue of\nprejudice in both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial is\none for the Tenth Circuit to consider on remand. See infra ,\nat 9. Similarly, the dissent asserts that Andrew falsely accuses\nthe prosecution of calling her a “slut puppy” in closing argument. Post , at 7, n. 3 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Whether the\nprosecution quoted something it believed Andrew once said to\nsuggest to the jury that Andrew herself was a “slut puppy,” or\nsimply to recite an alleged abusive phone call, is a question of\nfact for the Tenth Circuit to resolve. 2 The dissent asserts that\nthe OCCA held evidence of Andrew’s “ ‘close personal\nrelationship’ ” with two of her affair partners to be relevant\nbecause it gave credence to testimony that Andrew had\n“ ‘shared with both of these men her hatred for Rob Andrew and\nher wish that he was dead.’ ” Post , at 6 (opinion of\nThomas, J.) (quoting 164 P. 3d, at 192). Andrew never objected\nto evidence that she had a “close personal relationship” with these\nmen. In fact, defense counsel stipulated that she had affairs with\nthem. See, e . g ., Tr. 338 (June 18, 2004) (“We’re not\ncontesting the affair. We have never contested the affair with\nNunley or Higgins”). Andrew’s claim instead concerned the extensive\ntestimony about how she flirted with these men, how she dressed\naround them, and how many times (and where) she had sex with them.\nThat testimony appears to have no bearing on Andrew’s alleged\nexpressions of hatred for her husband. 3 The dissent argues that Estelle v. McGuire , 502 U.S.\n62 (1991), shows otherwise because it left open whether\n“ ‘it is a violation of the due process guaranteed by the\nFourteenth Amendment for evidence that is not relevant to be\nreceived in a criminal trial.’ ” Post , at 16 (opinion\nof Thomas, J.) (quoting Estelle , 502 U. S., at 70). To\nbe sure, this Court did not hold in Payne that the\nintroduction of all irrelevant evidence violates the Due Process\nClause. Payne established, rather, that due process protects\ndefendants from the introduction of evidence so prejudicial as to\naffect the fundamental fairness of their trials. This Court\nsquarely acknowledged that rule in Estelle , explaining that\n“the challenged evidence” at issue there did not warrant relief\nbecause it did not “ ‘so infus[e] the trial with unfairness as\nto deny due process of law.’ ” 502 U. S., at 75 (quoting Lisenba v. California , 314 U.S.\n219 , 228 (1941), and citing Donnelly , 416 U. S., at\n643). In any event, and as recounted below, this Court has\ncontinued to rely on Payne ’s fundamental fairness principle\nsince Estelle .",

DeChristoforo , 416 U.S.\n637 (1974); Caldwell v. Mississippi , 472 U.S.\n320 , 338–340 (1985); Darden , 477 U. S., at 178–183. Payne thus broke little new ground in this respect. By the\ntime of the OCCA’s decision in this case, it was clear that the\nintroduction of unduly prejudicial evidence could, in certain\ncases, violate the Due Process Clause.[ 3 ] B The Court of Appeals nonetheless held that Payne “merely established that the Eighth Amendment did not\nerect a ‘ per se bar’ to the introduction of\nvictim-impact statements in capital cases.” 62 F. 4th, at 1314\n(quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 827). As just explained,\nhowever, Payne expressly relied on the availability of\nrelief under the Due Process Clause to reach that conclusion. This\nCourt has accordingly applied Payne ’s framework to a claim\nmuch like Andrew’s: “that the introduction of [prejudicial]\nevidence” at the sentencing phases “violated the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.” Romano v. Oklahoma , 512 U.S.\n1 , 12 (1994). More recently, the Court relied on Payne in the same way that Andrew sought to rely on it here: for the\nproposition that “the Due Process Clause . . . wards off\nthe introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence that would render\nthe trial fundamentally unfair.” Kansas v. Carr , 577 U.S.\n108 , 123 (2016) (quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 825;\ninternal quotation marks and alteration omitted). This Court has\nalso relied on the underlying fundamental fairness principle in the\njury-impartiality context. See Rideau v. Louisiana , 373 U.S.\n723 , 726 (1963); Skilling v. United States , 561 U.S.\n358 , 379 (2010). To the extent that the Court of Appeals thought\nitself constrained by AEDPA to limit Payne to its facts, it\nwas mistaken. General legal principles can constitute clearly\nestablished law for purposes of AEDPA so long as they are holdings\nof this Court. For example, the Eighth Amendment principle that a\nsentence may not be grossly disproportionate to the offense is\n“ ‘clearly established’ under §2554(d)(1),” even though it\narises out of a “thicket of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence” and\nlacks “ ‘precise contours.’ ” Lockyer , 538\nU. S., at 72. Although this Court has not previously relied on Payne to invalidate a conviction for improperly admitted\nprejudicial evidence, moreover, “certain principles are fundamental\nenough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to\napply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt.” White , 572\nU. S., at 427 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado , 541 U.S.\n652 , 666 (2004)); see also Taylor v. Riojas , 592\nU.S. 7, 9 (2020) ( per curiam ) (“ ‘[A] general\nconstitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may\napply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in\nquestion’ ” (quoting Hope v. Pelzer , 536 U.S.\n730 , 741 (2002))). The Court of Appeals thus erred by refusing\neven to consider whether the OCCA unreasonably applied established\ndue process principles to Andrew’s case. The dissent maintains that a reasonable jurist\ncould agree with the Tenth Circuit’s understanding of our\nprecedent. That assertion conflates the deference federal habeas\ncourts must extend to a state court’s “application of ” this\nCourt’s precedent with the federal courts’ independent obligation\nto first identify the relevant “clearly established Federal law.”\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1); Lockyer , 538 U. S.,\nat 71 (identifying clearly established law “[a]s a threshold\nmatter”). A legal principle is clearly established for purposes of\nAEDPA if it is a holding of this Court. White , 572\nU. S., at 419. This Court has no occasion to defer to other\nfederal courts’ erroneous interpretations of its own precedent. Nor\nis such double deference necessary to prevent expansion of federal\nhabeas relief to those who rely on “debatable” interpretations or\nextensions of our holdings. Post at 17–18 (opinion of\nThomas, J.). Andrew does not rely on an interpretation or extension\nof this Court’s cases but on a principle this Court itself has\nrelied on over the course of decades. Because the Tenth Circuit nonetheless held that\nno relevant clearly established law existed (a ruling this Court\nreviews de novo ) it never considered whether the state\ncourt’s application of that law was reasonable. On remand, the\nCourt of Appeals should conduct that inquiry in the first instance.\nSpecifically, the question now is whether a fairminded jurist\nreviewing this record could disagree with Andrew that the trial\ncourt’s mistaken admission of irrelevant evidence was so “unduly\nprejudicial” as to render her trial “fundamentally unfair.” Payne , 501 U. S., at 825. The Court of Appeals must ask that question\nseparately for the guilt and sentencing phases. As to each phase,\nit might consider the relevance of the disputed evidence to the\ncharges or sentencing factors, the degree of prejudice Andrew\nsuffered from its introduction, and whether the trial court\nprovided any mitigating instructions. Cf. Romano , 512\nU. S., at 13. The ultimate question is whether a fairminded\njurist could disagree that the evidence “so infected the trial with\nunfairness” as to render the resulting conviction or sentence\n“a denial of due process.” Ibid. *  *  * At the time of the OCCA’s decision, clearly\nestablished law provided that the Due Process Clause forbids the\nintroduction of evidence so unduly prejudicial as to render a\ncriminal trial fundamentally unfair. This Court accordingly grants\nthe petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis , vacates the judgment below, and remands\nthe case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Notes 1 The dissent recites what\nit insists was substantial evidence of Andrew’s guilt, contending\nin the process that this Court “inaccurately portrays” that\nevidence. Post , at 2 (opinion of Thomas, J.). In doing so,\nit prejudges the prejudice analysis by characterizing as fact the\nState’s narrative at trial. That narrative, of course, was hotly\ncontested then and remains so now. For example, the defense\nelicited testimony from multiple witnesses that Andrew knew on the\nday of the murder that she was not the beneficiary on the life\ninsurance policy. The OCCA held that the court also wrongly\nexcluded evidence Andrew argued would cast doubt on the theory that\nshe had staged the shooting, though the OCCA held that exclusion\nwas harmless. Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23,\n¶¶89–92, 164 P.3d 176 , 197. The Court today says nothing about the\nstrength of the evidence against Andrew because the issue of\nprejudice in both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial is\none for the Tenth Circuit to consider on remand. See infra ,\nat 9. Similarly, the dissent asserts that Andrew falsely accuses\nthe prosecution of calling her a “slut puppy” in closing argument. Post , at 7, n. 3 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Whether the\nprosecution quoted something it believed Andrew once said to\nsuggest to the jury that Andrew herself was a “slut puppy,” or\nsimply to recite an alleged abusive phone call, is a question of\nfact for the Tenth Circuit to resolve. 2 The dissent asserts that\nthe OCCA held evidence of Andrew’s “ ‘close personal\nrelationship’ ” with two of her affair partners to be relevant\nbecause it gave credence to testimony that Andrew had\n“ ‘shared with both of these men her hatred for Rob Andrew and\nher wish that he was dead.’ ” Post , at 6 (opinion of\nThomas, J.) (quoting 164 P. 3d, at 192). Andrew never objected\nto evidence that she had a “close personal relationship” with these\nmen. In fact, defense counsel stipulated that she had affairs with\nthem. See, e . g ., Tr. 338 (June 18, 2004) (“We’re not\ncontesting the affair. We have never contested the affair with\nNunley or Higgins”). Andrew’s claim instead concerned the extensive\ntestimony about how she flirted with these men, how she dressed\naround them, and how many times (and where) she had sex with them.\nThat testimony appears to have no bearing on Andrew’s alleged\nexpressions of hatred for her husband. 3 The dissent argues that Estelle v. McGuire , 502 U.S.\n62 (1991), shows otherwise because it left open whether\n“ ‘it is a violation of the due process guaranteed by the\nFourteenth Amendment for evidence that is not relevant to be\nreceived in a criminal trial.’ ” Post , at 16 (opinion\nof Thomas, J.) (quoting Estelle , 502 U. S., at 70). To\nbe sure, this Court did not hold in Payne that the\nintroduction of all irrelevant evidence violates the Due Process\nClause. Payne established, rather, that due process protects\ndefendants from the introduction of evidence so prejudicial as to\naffect the fundamental fairness of their trials.

    "fulltext": " SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES BRENDA EVERS ANDREW v. TAMIKA WHITE,\nWARDEN on petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the tenth circuit No. 23–6573. Decided January 21, 2025 Per Curiam. An Oklahoma jury convicted Brenda Andrew of\nmurdering her husband, Rob Andrew, and sentenced her to death. The\nState spent significant time at trial introducing evidence about\nAndrew’s sex life and about her failings as a mother and wife, much\nof which it later conceded was irrelevant. In a federal habeas\npetition, Andrew argued that this evidence had been so prejudicial\nas to violate the Due Process Clause. The Court of Appeals rejected\nthat claim because, it thought, no holding of this Court\nestablished a general rule that the erroneous admission of\nprejudicial evidence could violate due process. That was wrong. By\nthe time of Andrew’s trial, this Court had made clear that when\n“evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it\nrenders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for relief.” Payne v. Tennessee , 501 U.S.\n808 , 825 (1991). I A On November 20, 2001, Rob Andrew was fatally\nshot in his garage. Brenda Andrew, who herself had been shot in the\narm during the incident, told the police that two armed assailants\nhad committed the shooting. Andrew further explained that she had\nseparated from her husband and was now dating James Pavatt, but\nthat she and Rob continued to see each other as they had two\nchildren together. Pavatt and Andrew traveled to Mexico together\nafter Rob Andrew’s death and soon became suspects in his murder.\nEventually, Pavatt confessed to committing the shooting with a\nfriend. Pavatt denied that Andrew had been involved. The State\nthereafter charged both Pavatt and Andrew with capital murder, and\na jury convicted Pavatt and sentenced him to death. At Andrew’s trial, the prosecution sought to\nprove that Andrew had conspired with Pavatt, an insurance agent, to\nmurder her husband for the proceeds of his life insurance policy.\nAmong other things, the prosecution elicited testimony about\nAndrew’s sexual partners reaching back two decades; about the\noutfits she wore to dinner or during grocery runs; about the\nunderwear she packed for vacation; and about how often she had sex\nin her car. At least two of the prosecution’s guilt-phase witnesses\ntook the stand exclusively to testify about Andrew’s provocative\nclothing, and others were asked to comment on whether a good mother\nwould dress or behave the way Andrew had. In its closing statement,\nthe prosecution again invoked these themes, including by displaying\nAndrew’s “thong underwear” to the jury, by reminding the jury of\nAndrew’s alleged affairs during college, and by emphasizing that\nAndrew “had sex on [her husband] over and over and over” while\n“keeping a boyfriend on the side.” Tr. 4103, 4124–4125 (July 12,\n2004). At both the guilt and sentencing phases, prosecutors\ncontrasted Andrew with the victim, whom they asserted had been\n“committed to God.” Id. , at 4124; see also, e.g. , Tr.\n4402 (July 14, 2004) (suggesting nothing could mitigate murder of\nRob Andrew because he just “wanted to love God”).[ 1 ] B The jury convicted Andrew and sentenced her to\ndeath. On appeal, Andrew argued that the introduction\nof irrelevant evidence, including evidence “that she had\nextramarital sexual affairs with two other men,” that she had\n“ ‘come on to’ ” another witness’s sons, and that she had\ndressed provocatively at a restaurant, Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23, ¶¶42–59, 164 P.3d 176 , 190–193, violated Oklahoma law as well as the\nFederal Due Process Clause. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n(OCCA) held that admission of evidence about Andrew’s extramarital\naffairs had been proper because it showed that “[h]er co-defendant\nwas just the last in a long line of men that she seduced.” Id., at 192.[ 2 ] The OCCA\n“struggl[ed],” however, “to find any relevance . . .\nother than to show [Andrew’s] character” for the remaining\nchallenged evidence. Ibid . By now, the State “agree[d] that\nmost of this evidence was irrelevant to any issue in this case.” Ibid. The OCCA nonetheless denied relief on the ground that\nthe trial court’s errors had been harmless. Judge Johnson dissented in part. In his view,\nthe “egregious . . . pattern of introducing evidence that\nha[d] no purpose other than to hammer home that Brenda Andrew is a\nbad wife, a bad mother, and a bad woman . . .\ntrivialize[d] the value of her life in the minds of the jurors.” Id ., at 206–207. He would therefore have vacated her\nsentence. Judge Chapel dissented separately, indicating that he\nwould have reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. Id ., at 208. In federal court, Andrew reiterated her claim\nthat the admission of this evidence rendered the guilt and penalty\nphases of her trial fundamentally unfair, in violation of due\nprocess. 62 F. 4th 1299, 1312–1313 (CA10 2023). The District\nCourt denied relief. A divided Tenth Circuit affirmed because, it\nheld, Andrew had failed to cite “clearly established federal law\ngoverning her claim.” Id ., at 1314. The majority\nacknowledged that Andrew had cited Payne , in which this\nCourt said that the Due Process Clause “provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” when the introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence\n“renders [a] trial fundamentally unfair.” 501 U. S., at 825.\nAccording to the majority, however, that had been a\n“pronouncement,” not a “holding,” of this Court. 62 F. 4th, at\n1314. It therefore concluded Andrew had failed to identify “clearly\nestablished federal law governing her claim,” as required under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Id ., at 1316; 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). As a\nresult, the majority declined to consider whether the OCCA\nunreasonably applied Payne , i . e ., whether a\nfairminded jurist could hold that the admission of irrelevant\nevidence about Andrew’s demeanor as a woman was not so prejudicial\nas to deprive her of a fundamentally fair trial. 62 F. 4th, at 1316\n(“ ‘The absence of clearly established federal law is\ndispositive under §2254(d)(1)’ ” (quoting House v. Hatch , 527 F.3d 1010, 1018 (CA10 2008))). In dissent, Judge Bacharach condemned the\nState’s focus “from start to finish on Ms. Andrew’s sex life,” a\nmove he argued “portrayed Ms. Andrew as a scarlet woman, a modern\nJezebel, sparking distrust based on her loose morals\n. . . plucking away any realistic chance that the jury\nwould seriously consider her version of events.” 62 F. 4th, at\n1366. Judge Bacharach therefore would have held that the\ncombination of evidentiary errors “deprived Ms. Andrew of a\nfundamentally fair trial.” Id ., at 1377. II A federal court may grant habeas relief as to\na claim adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the state\ncourt relied on an unreasonable determination of the facts or\nunreasonably applied “clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by” this Court. 28 U. S. C. §§2254(d)(1)–(2).\nTo show that a state court unreasonably applied clearly established\nfederal law, a petitioner must show that the court unreasonably\napplied “ ‘the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this\nCourt’s decisions.’ ” White v. Woodall , 572 U.S.\n415 , 419 (2014) (quoting Howes v. Fields , 565 U.S.\n499 , 505 (2012)). An unreasonable application, in turn, is one\nwith which no fairminded jurist would agree. Harrington v. Richter , 562 U.S.\n86 , 101 (2011). A When this Court relies on a legal rule or\nprinciple to decide a case, that principle is a “holding” of the\nCourt for purposes of AEDPA. Lockyer v. Andrade , 538 U.S.\n63 , 71–72 (2003) (“[C]learly established Federal law\n. . . is the governing legal principle or principles set\nforth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its\ndecision” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Following these\nprinciples, it is clear that Andrew properly identified clearly\nestablished federal law. In Payne , this Court considered whether\nto overrule a set of prior cases that had categorically barred the\nintroduction of victim impact evidence during the sentencing phases\nof a capital trial. The Court noted that, in many circumstances,\n“victim impact evidence serves entirely legitimate purposes,” 501\nU. S., at 825, even though in others it could be prejudicial.\nIt then concluded that a categorical bar was not necessary to\nprotect against the risk of prejudicial testimony because “the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” against the introduction of evidence “that is so\nunduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair.” Ibid. (citing Darden v. Wainwright , 477 U.S.\n168 , 179–183 (1986)). In light of that protection, the Court\nheld, it could permit victim impact evidence where appropriate\nwithout risking undue prejudice to defendants. 501 U. S., at\n825. In other words, the Court removed one protection for capital\ndefendants (the per se bar on victim impact statements)\nin part because another protection (the Due Process Clause)\nremained available against evidence that is so unduly prejudicial\nthat it renders the trial fundamentally unfair. The legal principle\non which Andrew relies, that the Due Process Clause can in certain\ncases protect against the introduction of unduly prejudicial\nevidence at a criminal trial, was therefore indispensable to the\ndecision in Payne . That means it was a holding of this Court\nfor purposes of AEDPA. Importantly, Payne did not invent due\nprocess protections against unduly prejudicial evidence. The Court\nhad several times before held that prosecutors’ prejudicial or\nmisleading statements violate due process if they render a trial or\ncapital sentencing fundamentally unfair. Donnelly v. DeChristoforo , 416 U.S.\n637 (1974); Caldwell v. Mississippi , 472 U.S.\n320 , 338–340 (1985); Darden , 477 U. S., at 178–183. Payne thus broke little new ground in this respect. By the\ntime of the OCCA’s decision in this case, it was clear that the\nintroduction of unduly prejudicial evidence could, in certain\ncases, violate the Due Process Clause.[ 3 ] B The Court of Appeals nonetheless held that Payne “merely established that the Eighth Amendment did not\nerect a ‘ per se bar’ to the introduction of\nvictim-impact statements in capital cases.” 62 F. 4th, at 1314\n(quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 827).

TAMIKA WHITE,\nWARDEN on petition for writ of certiorari to the\nunited states court of appeals for the tenth circuit No. 23–6573. Decided January 21, 2025 Per Curiam. An Oklahoma jury convicted Brenda Andrew of\nmurdering her husband, Rob Andrew, and sentenced her to death. The\nState spent significant time at trial introducing evidence about\nAndrew’s sex life and about her failings as a mother and wife, much\nof which it later conceded was irrelevant. In a federal habeas\npetition, Andrew argued that this evidence had been so prejudicial\nas to violate the Due Process Clause. The Court of Appeals rejected\nthat claim because, it thought, no holding of this Court\nestablished a general rule that the erroneous admission of\nprejudicial evidence could violate due process. That was wrong. By\nthe time of Andrew’s trial, this Court had made clear that when\n“evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it\nrenders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for relief.” Payne v. Tennessee , 501 U.S.\n808 , 825 (1991). I A On November 20, 2001, Rob Andrew was fatally\nshot in his garage. Brenda Andrew, who herself had been shot in the\narm during the incident, told the police that two armed assailants\nhad committed the shooting. Andrew further explained that she had\nseparated from her husband and was now dating James Pavatt, but\nthat she and Rob continued to see each other as they had two\nchildren together. Pavatt and Andrew traveled to Mexico together\nafter Rob Andrew’s death and soon became suspects in his murder.\nEventually, Pavatt confessed to committing the shooting with a\nfriend. Pavatt denied that Andrew had been involved. The State\nthereafter charged both Pavatt and Andrew with capital murder, and\na jury convicted Pavatt and sentenced him to death. At Andrew’s trial, the prosecution sought to\nprove that Andrew had conspired with Pavatt, an insurance agent, to\nmurder her husband for the proceeds of his life insurance policy.\nAmong other things, the prosecution elicited testimony about\nAndrew’s sexual partners reaching back two decades; about the\noutfits she wore to dinner or during grocery runs; about the\nunderwear she packed for vacation; and about how often she had sex\nin her car. At least two of the prosecution’s guilt-phase witnesses\ntook the stand exclusively to testify about Andrew’s provocative\nclothing, and others were asked to comment on whether a good mother\nwould dress or behave the way Andrew had. In its closing statement,\nthe prosecution again invoked these themes, including by displaying\nAndrew’s “thong underwear” to the jury, by reminding the jury of\nAndrew’s alleged affairs during college, and by emphasizing that\nAndrew “had sex on [her husband] over and over and over” while\n“keeping a boyfriend on the side.” Tr. 4103, 4124–4125 (July 12,\n2004). At both the guilt and sentencing phases, prosecutors\ncontrasted Andrew with the victim, whom they asserted had been\n“committed to God.” Id. , at 4124; see also, e.g. , Tr.\n4402 (July 14, 2004) (suggesting nothing could mitigate murder of\nRob Andrew because he just “wanted to love God”).[ 1 ] B The jury convicted Andrew and sentenced her to\ndeath. On appeal, Andrew argued that the introduction\nof irrelevant evidence, including evidence “that she had\nextramarital sexual affairs with two other men,” that she had\n“ ‘come on to’ ” another witness’s sons, and that she had\ndressed provocatively at a restaurant, Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23, ¶¶42–59, 164 P.3d 176 , 190–193, violated Oklahoma law as well as the\nFederal Due Process Clause. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\n(OCCA) held that admission of evidence about Andrew’s extramarital\naffairs had been proper because it showed that “[h]er co-defendant\nwas just the last in a long line of men that she seduced.” Id., at 192.[ 2 ] The OCCA\n“struggl[ed],” however, “to find any relevance . . .\nother than to show [Andrew’s] character” for the remaining\nchallenged evidence. Ibid . By now, the State “agree[d] that\nmost of this evidence was irrelevant to any issue in this case.” Ibid. The OCCA nonetheless denied relief on the ground that\nthe trial court’s errors had been harmless. Judge Johnson dissented in part. In his view,\nthe “egregious . . . pattern of introducing evidence that\nha[d] no purpose other than to hammer home that Brenda Andrew is a\nbad wife, a bad mother, and a bad woman . . .\ntrivialize[d] the value of her life in the minds of the jurors.” Id ., at 206–207. He would therefore have vacated her\nsentence. Judge Chapel dissented separately, indicating that he\nwould have reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. Id ., at 208. In federal court, Andrew reiterated her claim\nthat the admission of this evidence rendered the guilt and penalty\nphases of her trial fundamentally unfair, in violation of due\nprocess. 62 F. 4th 1299, 1312–1313 (CA10 2023). The District\nCourt denied relief. A divided Tenth Circuit affirmed because, it\nheld, Andrew had failed to cite “clearly established federal law\ngoverning her claim.” Id ., at 1314. The majority\nacknowledged that Andrew had cited Payne , in which this\nCourt said that the Due Process Clause “provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” when the introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence\n“renders [a] trial fundamentally unfair.” 501 U. S., at 825.\nAccording to the majority, however, that had been a\n“pronouncement,” not a “holding,” of this Court. 62 F. 4th, at\n1314. It therefore concluded Andrew had failed to identify “clearly\nestablished federal law governing her claim,” as required under the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). Id ., at 1316; 28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1). As a\nresult, the majority declined to consider whether the OCCA\nunreasonably applied Payne , i . e ., whether a\nfairminded jurist could hold that the admission of irrelevant\nevidence about Andrew’s demeanor as a woman was not so prejudicial\nas to deprive her of a fundamentally fair trial. 62 F. 4th, at 1316\n(“ ‘The absence of clearly established federal law is\ndispositive under §2254(d)(1)’ ” (quoting House v. Hatch , 527 F.3d 1010, 1018 (CA10 2008))). In dissent, Judge Bacharach condemned the\nState’s focus “from start to finish on Ms. Andrew’s sex life,” a\nmove he argued “portrayed Ms. Andrew as a scarlet woman, a modern\nJezebel, sparking distrust based on her loose morals\n. . . plucking away any realistic chance that the jury\nwould seriously consider her version of events.” 62 F. 4th, at\n1366. Judge Bacharach therefore would have held that the\ncombination of evidentiary errors “deprived Ms. Andrew of a\nfundamentally fair trial.” Id ., at 1377. II A federal court may grant habeas relief as to\na claim adjudicated on the merits in state court only if the state\ncourt relied on an unreasonable determination of the facts or\nunreasonably applied “clearly established Federal law, as\ndetermined by” this Court. 28 U. S. C. §§2254(d)(1)–(2).\nTo show that a state court unreasonably applied clearly established\nfederal law, a petitioner must show that the court unreasonably\napplied “ ‘the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this\nCourt’s decisions.’ ” White v. Woodall , 572 U.S.\n415 , 419 (2014) (quoting Howes v. Fields , 565 U.S.\n499 , 505 (2012)). An unreasonable application, in turn, is one\nwith which no fairminded jurist would agree. Harrington v. Richter , 562 U.S.\n86 , 101 (2011). A When this Court relies on a legal rule or\nprinciple to decide a case, that principle is a “holding” of the\nCourt for purposes of AEDPA. Lockyer v. Andrade , 538 U.S.\n63 , 71–72 (2003) (“[C]learly established Federal law\n. . . is the governing legal principle or principles set\nforth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its\ndecision” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Following these\nprinciples, it is clear that Andrew properly identified clearly\nestablished federal law. In Payne , this Court considered whether\nto overrule a set of prior cases that had categorically barred the\nintroduction of victim impact evidence during the sentencing phases\nof a capital trial. The Court noted that, in many circumstances,\n“victim impact evidence serves entirely legitimate purposes,” 501\nU. S., at 825, even though in others it could be prejudicial.\nIt then concluded that a categorical bar was not necessary to\nprotect against the risk of prejudicial testimony because “the Due\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides a mechanism for\nrelief ” against the introduction of evidence “that is so\nunduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair.” Ibid. (citing Darden v. Wainwright , 477 U.S.\n168 , 179–183 (1986)). In light of that protection, the Court\nheld, it could permit victim impact evidence where appropriate\nwithout risking undue prejudice to defendants. 501 U. S., at\n825. In other words, the Court removed one protection for capital\ndefendants (the per se bar on victim impact statements)\nin part because another protection (the Due Process Clause)\nremained available against evidence that is so unduly prejudicial\nthat it renders the trial fundamentally unfair. The legal principle\non which Andrew relies, that the Due Process Clause can in certain\ncases protect against the introduction of unduly prejudicial\nevidence at a criminal trial, was therefore indispensable to the\ndecision in Payne . That means it was a holding of this Court\nfor purposes of AEDPA. Importantly, Payne did not invent due\nprocess protections against unduly prejudicial evidence. The Court\nhad several times before held that prosecutors’ prejudicial or\nmisleading statements violate due process if they render a trial or\ncapital sentencing fundamentally unfair. Donnelly v. DeChristoforo , 416 U.S.\n637 (1974); Caldwell v. Mississippi , 472 U.S.\n320 , 338–340 (1985); Darden , 477 U. S., at 178–183. Payne thus broke little new ground in this respect. By the\ntime of the OCCA’s decision in this case, it was clear that the\nintroduction of unduly prejudicial evidence could, in certain\ncases, violate the Due Process Clause.[ 3 ] B The Court of Appeals nonetheless held that Payne “merely established that the Eighth Amendment did not\nerect a ‘ per se bar’ to the introduction of\nvictim-impact statements in capital cases.” 62 F. 4th, at 1314\n(quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 827). As just explained,\nhowever, Payne expressly relied on the availability of\nrelief under the Due Process Clause to reach that conclusion. This\nCourt has accordingly applied Payne ’s framework to a claim\nmuch like Andrew’s: “that the introduction of [prejudicial]\nevidence” at the sentencing phases “violated the Due Process Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.” Romano v. Oklahoma , 512 U.S.\n1 , 12 (1994). More recently, the Court relied on Payne in the same way that Andrew sought to rely on it here: for the\nproposition that “the Due Process Clause . . . wards off\nthe introduction of unduly prejudicial evidence that would render\nthe trial fundamentally unfair.” Kansas v. Carr , 577 U.S.\n108 , 123 (2016) (quoting Payne , 501 U. S., at 825;\ninternal quotation marks and alteration omitted). This Court has\nalso relied on the underlying fundamental fairness principle in the\njury-impartiality context. See Rideau v. Louisiana , 373 U.S.\n723 , 726 (1963); Skilling v. United States , 561 U.S.\n358 , 379 (2010). To the extent that the Court of Appeals thought\nitself constrained by AEDPA to limit Payne to its facts, it\nwas mistaken. General legal principles can constitute clearly\nestablished law for purposes of AEDPA so long as they are holdings\nof this Court. For example, the Eighth Amendment principle that a\nsentence may not be grossly disproportionate to the offense is\n“ ‘clearly established’ under §2554(d)(1),” even though it\narises out of a “thicket of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence” and\nlacks “ ‘precise contours.’ ” Lockyer , 538\nU. S., at 72. Although this Court has not previously relied on Payne to invalidate a conviction for improperly admitted\nprejudicial evidence, moreover, “certain principles are fundamental\nenough that when new factual permutations arise, the necessity to\napply the earlier rule will be beyond doubt.” White , 572\nU. S., at 427 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado , 541 U.S.\n652 , 666 (2004)); see also Taylor v. Riojas , 592\nU.S. 7, 9 (2020) ( per curiam ) (“ ‘[A] general\nconstitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may\napply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in\nquestion’ ” (quoting Hope v. Pelzer , 536 U.S.\n730 , 741 (2002))). The Court of Appeals thus erred by refusing\neven to consider whether the OCCA unreasonably applied established\ndue process principles to Andrew’s case. The dissent maintains that a reasonable jurist\ncould agree with the Tenth Circuit’s understanding of our\nprecedent. That assertion conflates the deference federal habeas\ncourts must extend to a state court’s “application of ” this\nCourt’s precedent with the federal courts’ independent obligation\nto first identify the relevant “clearly established Federal law.”\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1); Lockyer , 538 U. S.,\nat 71 (identifying clearly established law “[a]s a threshold\nmatter”). A legal principle is clearly established for purposes of\nAEDPA if it is a holding of this Court. White , 572\nU. S., at 419. This Court has no occasion to defer to other\nfederal courts’ erroneous interpretations of its own precedent. Nor\nis such double deference necessary to prevent expansion of federal\nhabeas relief to those who rely on “debatable” interpretations or\nextensions of our holdings. Post at 17–18 (opinion of\nThomas, J.). Andrew does not rely on an interpretation or extension\nof this Court’s cases but on a principle this Court itself has\nrelied on over the course of decades. Because the Tenth Circuit nonetheless held that\nno relevant clearly established law existed (a ruling this Court\nreviews de novo ) it never considered whether the state\ncourt’s application of that law was reasonable. On remand, the\nCourt of Appeals should conduct that inquiry in the first instance.\nSpecifically, the question now is whether a fairminded jurist\nreviewing this record could disagree with Andrew that the trial\ncourt’s mistaken admission of irrelevant evidence was so “unduly\nprejudicial” as to render her trial “fundamentally unfair.” Payne , 501 U. S., at 825. The Court of Appeals must ask that question\nseparately for the guilt and sentencing phases. As to each phase,\nit might consider the relevance of the disputed evidence to the\ncharges or sentencing factors, the degree of prejudice Andrew\nsuffered from its introduction, and whether the trial court\nprovided any mitigating instructions. Cf. Romano , 512\nU. S., at 13. The ultimate question is whether a fairminded\njurist could disagree that the evidence “so infected the trial with\nunfairness” as to render the resulting conviction or sentence\n“a denial of due process.” Ibid. *  *  * At the time of the OCCA’s decision, clearly\nestablished law provided that the Due Process Clause forbids the\nintroduction of evidence so unduly prejudicial as to render a\ncriminal trial fundamentally unfair. This Court accordingly grants\nthe petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis , vacates the judgment below, and remands\nthe case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Notes 1 The dissent recites what\nit insists was substantial evidence of Andrew’s guilt, contending\nin the process that this Court “inaccurately portrays” that\nevidence. Post , at 2 (opinion of Thomas, J.). In doing so,\nit prejudges the prejudice analysis by characterizing as fact the\nState’s narrative at trial. That narrative, of course, was hotly\ncontested then and remains so now. For example, the defense\nelicited testimony from multiple witnesses that Andrew knew on the\nday of the murder that she was not the beneficiary on the life\ninsurance policy. The OCCA held that the court also wrongly\nexcluded evidence Andrew argued would cast doubt on the theory that\nshe had staged the shooting, though the OCCA held that exclusion\nwas harmless. Andrew v. State , 2007 OK CR 23,\n¶¶89–92, 164 P.3d 176 , 197. The Court today says nothing about the\nstrength of the evidence against Andrew because the issue of\nprejudice in both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial is\none for the Tenth Circuit to consider on remand. See infra ,\nat 9. Similarly, the dissent asserts that Andrew falsely accuses\nthe prosecution of calling her a “slut puppy” in closing argument. Post , at 7, n. 3 (opinion of Thomas, J.). Whether the\nprosecution quoted something it believed Andrew once said to\nsuggest to the jury that Andrew herself was a “slut puppy,” or\nsimply to recite an alleged abusive phone call, is a question of\nfact for the Tenth Circuit to resolve. 2 The dissent asserts that\nthe OCCA held evidence of Andrew’s “ ‘close personal\nrelationship’ ” with two of her affair partners to be relevant\nbecause it gave credence to testimony that Andrew had\n“ ‘shared with both of these men her hatred for Rob Andrew and\nher wish that he was dead.’ ” Post , at 6 (opinion of\nThomas, J.) (quoting 164 P. 3d, at 192). Andrew never objected\nto evidence that she had a “close personal relationship” with these\nmen. In fact, defense counsel stipulated that she had affairs with\nthem. See, e . g ., Tr. 338 (June 18, 2004) (“We’re not\ncontesting the affair. We have never contested the affair with\nNunley or Higgins”). Andrew’s claim instead concerned the extensive\ntestimony about how she flirted with these men, how she dressed\naround them, and how many times (and where) she had sex with them.\nThat testimony appears to have no bearing on Andrew’s alleged\nexpressions of hatred for her husband. 3 The dissent argues that Estelle v. McGuire , 502 U.S.\n62 (1991), shows otherwise because it left open whether\n“ ‘it is a violation of the due process guaranteed by the\nFourteenth Amendment for evidence that is not relevant to be\nreceived in a criminal trial.’ ” Post , at 16 (opinion\nof Thomas, J.) (quoting Estelle , 502 U. S., at 70). To\nbe sure, this Court did not hold in Payne that the\nintroduction of all irrelevant evidence violates the Due Process\nClause. Payne established, rather, that due process protects\ndefendants from the introduction of evidence so prejudicial as to\naffect the fundamental fairness of their trials. This Court\nsquarely acknowledged that rule in Estelle , explaining that\n“the challenged evidence” at issue there did not warrant relief\nbecause it did not “ ‘so infus[e] the trial with unfairness as\nto deny due process of law.’ ” 502 U. S., at 75 (quoting Lisenba v. California , 314 U.S.\n219 , 228 (1941), and citing Donnelly , 416 U. S., at\n643). In any event, and as recounted below, this Court has\ncontinued to rely on Payne ’s fundamental fairness principle\nsince Estelle .",

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES _________________ Nos. 24–656 and 24–657 _________________ TIKTOK INC., et al., PETITIONERS 24–656 v. MERRICK B. GARLAND, ATTORNEY\nGENERAL BRIAN FIREBAUGH, et al., PETITIONERS 24–657 v. MERRICK B. GARLAND, ATTORNEY\nGENERAL on applications for injunction pending review\nto the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia\ncircuit [January 17, 2025] Per Curiam. As of January 19, the Protecting Americans from\nForeign Adversary Controlled Applications Act will make it unlawful\nfor companies in the United States to provide services to\ndistribute, maintain, or update the social media platform TikTok,\nunless U. S. operation of the platform is severed from Chinese\ncontrol. Petitioners are two TikTok operating entities and a group\nof U. S. TikTok users. We consider whether the Act, as applied\nto petitioners, violates the First Amendment. In doing so, we are conscious that the cases\nbefore us involve new technologies with transformative\ncapabilities. This challenging new context counsels caution on our\npart. As Justice Frankfurter advised 80 years ago in considering\nthe application of established legal rules to the “totally new\nproblems” raised by the airplane and radio, we should take care not\nto “embarrass the future.” Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Minnesota , 322 U.S.\n292 , 300 (1944). That caution is heightened in these cases,\ngiven the expedited time allowed for our consideration.[ 1 ] Our analysis must be understood to\nbe narrowly focused in light of these circumstances. I A TikTok is a social media platform that allows\nusers to create, publish, view, share, and interact with short\nvideos overlaid with audio and text. Since its launch in 2017, the\nplatform has accumulated over 170 million users in the United\nStates and more than one billion worldwide. Those users are\nprolific content creators and viewers. In 2023, U. S. TikTok\nusers uploaded more than 5.5 billion videos, which were in turn\nviewed more than 13 trillion times around the world. Opening the TikTok application brings a user to\nthe “For You” page—a personalized content feed tailored to the\nuser’s interests. TikTok generates the feed using a proprietary\nalgorithm that recommends videos to a user based on the user’s\ninteractions with the platform. Each interaction a user has on\nTikTok—watching a video, following an account, leaving a\ncomment—enables the recommendation system to further tailor a\npersonalized content feed. A TikTok user’s content feed is also shaped by\ncontent moderation and filtering decisions. TikTok uses automated\nand human processes to remove content that violates the platform’s\ncommunity guidelines. See 1 App. 493–497. TikTok also promotes or\ndemotes certain content to advance its business objectives and\nother goals. See id ., at 499–501. TikTok is operated in the United States by\nTikTok Inc., an American company incorporated and headquartered in\nCalifornia. TikTok Inc.’s ultimate parent company is ByteDance\nLtd., a privately held company that has operations in China.\nByteDance Ltd. owns TikTok’s proprietary algorithm, which is\ndeveloped and maintained in China. The company is also responsible\nfor developing portions of the source code that runs the TikTok\nplatform. ByteDance Ltd. is subject to Chinese laws that require it\nto “assist or cooperate” with the Chinese Government’s\n“intelligence work” and to ensure that the Chinese Government has\n“the power to access and control private data” the company holds.\nH. R. Rep. No. 118–417, p. 4 (2024) (H. R. Rep.);\nsee 2 App. 673–676. B 1 In recent years, U. S. government\nofficials have taken repeated actions to address national security\nconcerns regarding the relationship between China and TikTok. In August 2020, President Trump issued an\nExecutive Order finding that “the spread in the United States of\nmobile applications developed and owned by companies in [China]\ncontinues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and\neconomy of the United States.” Exec. Order No. 13942, 3 CFR 412\n(2021). President Trump determined that TikTok raised particular\nconcerns, noting that the platform “automatically captures vast\nswaths of information from its users” and is susceptible to being\nused to further the interests of the Chinese Government. Ibid. The President invoked his authority under the\nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50\nU. S. C. §1701 et seq ., and the National\nEmergencies Act, 50 U. S. C. §1601 et seq .,\nto prohibit certain “transactions” involving ByteDance Ltd. or its\nsubsidiaries, as identified by the Secretary of Commerce. 3 CFR\n413. The Secretary published a list of prohibited transactions in\nSeptember 2020. See 85 Fed. Reg. 60061 (2020). But federal courts\nenjoined the prohibitions before they took effect, finding that\nthey exceeded the Executive Branch’s authority under IEEPA. See\ngenerally TikTok Inc. v. Trump , 507 F. Supp. 3d\n92 (DC 2020); Marland v. Trump , 498 F. Supp. 3d\n624 (ED Pa. 2020). Just days after issuing his initial Executive\nOrder, President Trump ordered ByteDance Ltd. to divest all\ninterests and rights in any property “used to enable or support\nByteDance’s operation of the TikTok application in the United\nStates,” along with “any data obtained or derived from” U. S.\nTikTok users. 85 Fed. Reg. 51297. ByteDance Ltd. and TikTok Inc.\nfiled suit in the D. C. Circuit, challenging the\nconstitutionality of the order. In February 2021, the D. C. Circuit\nplaced the case in abeyance to permit the Biden administration to\nreview the matter and to enable the parties to negotiate a\nnon-divestiture remedy that would address the Government’s national\nsecurity concerns. See Order in TikTok Inc. v. Committee\non Foreign Investment , No. 20–1444 (CADC, Feb. 19, 2021). Throughout 2021 and 2022, ByteDance Ltd.\nnegotiated with Executive Branch officials to develop a national\nsecurity agreement that would resolve those concerns. Executive\nBranch officials ultimately determined, however, that ByteDance\nLtd.’s proposed agreement did not adequately “mitigate the risks\nposed to U. S. national security interests.” 2 App. 686.\nNegotiations stalled, and the parties never finalized an\nagreement. 2 Against this backdrop, Congress enacted the\nProtecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications\nAct. Pub. L. 118–50, div. H, 138 Stat. 955. The Act makes it\nunlawful for any entity to provide certain services to “distribute,\nmaintain, or update” a “foreign adversary controlled application”\nin the United States. §2(a)(1). Entities that violate this\nprohibition are subject to civil enforcement actions and hefty\nmonetary penalties. See §§2(d)(1)(A), (d)(2)(B). The Act provides two means by which an\napplication may be designated a “foreign adversary controlled\napplication.” First, the Act expressly designates any application\nthat is “operated, directly or indirectly,” by “ByteDance Ltd.” or\n“TikTok,” or any subsidiary or successor thereof. §2(g)(3)(A).\nSecond, the Act establishes a general designation framework for any\napplication that is both (1) operated by a “covered company” that\nis “controlled by a foreign adversary,” and (2) “determined by the\nPresident to present a significant threat to the national security\nof the United States,” following a public notice and reporting\nprocess. §2(g)(3)(B). In broad terms, the Act defines “covered\ncompany” to include a company that operates an application that\nenables users to generate, share, and view content and has more\nthan 1,000,000 monthly active users. §2(g)(2)(A). The Act excludes\nfrom that definition a company that operates an application “whose\nprimary purpose is to allow users to post product reviews, business\nreviews, or travel information and reviews.” §2(g)(2)(B). The Act’s prohibitions take effect 270 days\nafter an application is designated a foreign adversary controlled\napplication. §2(a)(2). Because the Act itself designates\napplications operated by “ByteDance, Ltd.” and “TikTok,”\nprohibitions as to those applications take effect 270 days after\nthe Act’s enactment—January 19, 2025. The Act exempts a foreign adversary controlled\napplication from the prohibitions if the application undergoes a\n“qualified divestiture.” §2(c)(1). A “qualified divestiture” is one\nthat the President determines will result in the application “no\nlonger being controlled by a foreign adversary.” §2(g)(6)(A). The\nPresident must further determine that the divestiture “precludes\nthe establishment or maintenance of any operational relationship\nbetween the United States operations of the [application] and any\nformerly affiliated entities that are controlled by a foreign\nadversary, including any cooperation with respect to the operation\nof a content recommendation algorithm or an agreement with respect\nto data sharing.” §2(g)(6)(B). The Act permits the President to\ngrant a one-time extension of no more than 90 days with respect to\nthe prohibitions’ 270-day effective date if the President makes\ncertain certifications to Congress regarding progress toward a\nqualified divestiture. §2(a)(3). C ByteDance Ltd. and TikTok Inc.—along with two\nsets of TikTok users and creators (creator petitioners)—filed\npetitions for review in the D. C. Circuit, challenging the\nconstitutionality of the Act. As relevant here, the petitioners\nargued that the Act’s prohibitions, TikTok-specific foreign\nadversary controlled application designation, and divestiture\nrequirement violate the First Amendment. The D. C. Circuit consolidated and denied\nthe petitions, holding that the Act does not violate petitioners’\nFirst Amendment rights. 122 F. 4th 930, 940, 948–965 (CADC 2024).\nAfter first concluding that the Act was subject to heightened\nscrutiny under the First Amendment, the court assumed without\ndeciding that strict, rather than intermediate, scrutiny applied. Id ., at 948–952. The court held that the Act satisfied that\nstandard, finding that the Government’s national security\njustifications—countering China’s data collection and covert\ncontent manipulation efforts—were compelling, and that the Act was\nnarrowly tailored to further those interests. Id ., at\n952–965. Chief Judge Srinivasan concurred in part and in\nthe judgment. Id ., at 970. In his view, the Act was subject\nto intermediate scrutiny, id ., at 974–979, and was\nconstitutional under that standard, id ., at 979–983. We granted certiorari to decide whether the Act,\nas applied to petitioners, violates the First Amendment. 604\nU. S. ___ (2024). II A At the threshold, we consider whether the\nchallenged provisions are subject to First Amendment scrutiny. Laws\nthat directly regulate expressive conduct can, but do not\nnecessarily, trigger such review. See R. A. V. v. St. Paul , 505 U.S.\n377 , 382–386 (1992). We have also applied First Amendment\nscrutiny in “cases involving governmental regulation of conduct\nthat has an expressive element,” and to “some statutes which,\nalthough directed at activity with no expressive component, impose\na disproportionate burden upon those engaged in protected First\nAmendment activities.” Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc. , 478 U.S.\n697 , 703–704 (1986). It is not clear that the Act itself directly\nregulates protected expressive activity, or conduct with an\nexpressive component. Indeed, the Act does not regulate the creator\npetitioners at all. And it directly regulates ByteDance Ltd. and\nTikTok Inc. only through the divestiture requirement. See §2(c)(1).\nPetitioners, for their part, have not identified any case in which\nthis Court has treated a regulation of corporate control as a direct regulation of expressive activity or semi-expressive\nconduct. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37–40. We hesitate to break that new\nground in this unique case. In any event, petitioners’ arguments more\nclosely approximate a claim that the Act’s prohibitions,\nTikTok-specific designation, and divestiture requirement “impose a\ndisproportionate burden upon” their First Amendment activities. Arcara , 478 U. S., at 704. Petitioners assert—and the\nGovernment does not contest—that, because it is commercially\ninfeasible for TikTok to be divested within the Act’s 270-day\ntimeframe, the Act effectively bans TikTok in the United States.\nPetitioners argue that such a ban will burden various First\nAmendment activities, including content moderation, content\ngeneration, access to a distinct medium for expression, association\nwith another speaker or preferred editor, and receipt of\ninformation and ideas. We have recognized a number of these asserted\nFirst Amendment interests. See Moody v. NetChoice,\nLLC , 603 U.S. 707, 731 (2024) (“An entity ‘exercising editorial\ndiscretion in the selection and presentation’ of content is\n‘engaged in speech activity.’ ” (quoting Arkansas Ed.\nTelevision Comm’n v. Forbes , 523\nU.S. 666 , 674 (1998); alteration omitted)); City of\nLadue v. Gilleo , 512 U.S.\n43 , 54–58 (1994) (“Our prior decisions have voiced particular\nconcern with laws that foreclose an entire medium of expression.”); Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights,\nInc. , 547 U.S.\n47 , 68 (2006) (“We have recognized a First Amendment right to\nassociate for the purpose of speaking, which we have termed a\n‘right of expressive association.’ ”); Martin v. City of Struthers , 319 U.S.\n141 , 143 (1943) (“The right of freedom of speech and press\n. . . embraces the right to distribute literature and\nnecessarily protects the right to receive it.” (citation\nomitted)).[ 2 ] And an effective\nban on a social media platform with 170 million U. S. users\ncertainly burdens those users’ expressive activity in a non-trivial\nway. At the same time, a law targeting a foreign\nadversary’s control over a communications platform is in many ways\ndifferent in kind from the regulations of non-expressive activity\nthat we have subjected to First Amendment scrutiny. Those\ndifferences—the Act’s focus on a foreign government, the\ncongressionally determined adversary relationship between that\nforeign government and the United States, and the causal steps\nbetween the regulations and the alleged burden on protected\nspeech—may impact whether First Amendment scrutiny applies. This Court has not articulated a clear framework\nfor determining whether a regulation of non-expressive activity\nthat disproportionately burdens those engaged in expressive\nactivity triggers heightened review. We need not do so here. We\nassume without deciding that the challenged provisions fall within\nthis category and are subject to First Amendment scrutiny. B 1 “At the heart of the First Amendment lies the\nprinciple that each person should decide for himself or herself the\nideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and\nadherence.” Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC , 512 U.S.\n622 , 641 (1994) ( Turner I ). Government action that\nsuppresses speech because of its message “contravenes this\nessential right.” Ibid. “Content-based laws—those that\ntarget speech based on its communicative content—are presumptively\nunconstitutional and may be justified only if the government proves\nthat they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state\ninterests.” Reed v. Town of Gilbert , 576 U.S.\n155 , 163 (2015). Content-neutral laws, in contrast, “are\nsubject to an intermediate level of scrutiny because in most cases\nthey pose a less substantial risk of excising certain ideas or\nviewpoints from the public dialogue.” Turner I , 512\nU. S., at 642 (citation omitted). Under that standard, we will\nsustain a content-neutral law “if it advances important\ngovernmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech\nand does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to\nfurther those interests.” Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC , 520 U.S.\n180 , 189 (1997) ( Turner II ). We have identified two forms of content-based\nspeech regulation. First, a law is content based on its face if it\n“applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the\nidea or message expressed.” Reed , 576 U. S., at 163;\nsee id. , at 163–164 (explaining that some facial\ndistinctions define regulated speech by subject matter, others by\nthe speech’s function or purpose). Second, a facially\ncontent-neutral law is nonetheless treated as a content-based\nregulation of speech if it “cannot be ‘justified without reference\nto the content of the regulated speech’ ” or was “adopted by\nthe government ‘because of disagreement with the message the speech\nconveys.’ ” Id ., at 164 (quoting Ward v. Rock\nAgainst Racism , 491 U.S.\n781 , 791 (1989)). As applied to petitioners, the challenged\nprovisions are facially content neutral and are justified by a\ncontent- neutral rationale. a The challenged provisions are facially content\nneutral. They impose TikTok-specific prohibitions due to a foreign\nadversary’s control over the platform and make divestiture a\nprerequisite for the platform’s continued operation in the United\nStates. They do not target particular speech based upon its\ncontent, contrast, e . g ., Carey v. Brown , 447 U.S.\n455 , 465 (1980) (statute prohibiting all residential picketing\nexcept “peaceful labor picketing”), or regulate speech based on its\nfunction or purpose, contrast, e . g ., Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project , 561 U.S.\n1 , 7, 27 (2010) (law prohibiting providing material support to\nterrorists). Nor do they impose a “restriction, penalty, or burden”\nby reason of content on TikTok—a conclusion confirmed by the fact\nthat petitioners “cannot avoid or mitigate” the effects of the Act\nby altering their speech. Turner I , 512 U. S., at 644.\nAs to petitioners, the Act thus does not facially regulate\n“particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or\nmessage expressed.” Reed , 576 U. S., at 163. Petitioners argue that the Act is content based\non its face because it excludes from the definition of “covered\ncompany” any company that operates an application “whose primary\npurpose is to allow users to post product reviews, business\nreviews, or travel information and reviews.” §2(g)(2)(B); see Brief\nfor Petitioners in No. 24–656, pp. 26–27 (Brief for TikTok);\nBrief for Petitioners in No. 24–657, p. 26 (Brief for Creator\nPetitioners). We need not decide whether that exclusion is content\nbased. The question before the Court is whether the Act violates\nthe First Amendment as applied to petitioners . To answer\nthat question, we look to the provisions of the Act that give rise\nto the effective TikTok ban that petitioners argue burdens their\nFirst Amendment rights. The exclusion for certain review platforms,\nhowever, applies only to the general framework for designating\napplications controlled by “covered compan[ies],” not to the\nTikTok-specific designation. §§2(g)(3)(A)–(B). As such, the\nexclusion is not within the scope of petitioners’ as-applied\nchallenge. b The Government also supports the challenged\nprovisions with a content-neutral justification: preventing China\nfrom collecting vast amounts of sensitive data from 170 million\nU. S. TikTok users. 2 App. 628. That rationale is decidedly\ncontent agnostic. It neither references the content of speech on\nTikTok nor reflects disagreement with the message such speech\nconveys. Cf. Ward , 491 U. S., at 792–793 (holding noise\ncontrol and sound quality justifications behind city sound\namplification guideline were content neutral). Because the data collection justification\nreflects a “purpos[e] unrelated to the content of expression,” it\nis content neutral. Id ., at 791. 2 The Act’s TikTok-specific distinctions,\nmoreover, do not trigger strict scrutiny. See Brief for TikTok\n26–27; Brief for Creator Petitioners 24–26. It is true that\n“[s]peech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker are all\ntoo often simply a means to control content.” Citizens\nUnited v. Federal Election Comm’n , 558 U.S.\n310 , 340 (2010). For that reason, “[r]egulations that\ndiscriminate among media, or among different speakers within a\nsingle medium, often present serious First Amendment concerns.” Turner I , 512 U. S., at 659. But while “laws favoring\nsome speakers over others demand strict scrutiny when the\nlegislature’s speaker preference reflects a content preference,” id. , at 658, such scrutiny “is unwarranted when the\ndifferential treatment is ‘justified by some special characteristic\nof ’ the particular [speaker] being regulated,” id ., at\n660–661 (quoting Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm’r of Revenue , 460 U.S.\n575 , 585 (1983)). For the reasons we have explained, requiring\ndivestiture for the purpose of preventing a foreign adversary from\naccessing the sensitive data of 170 million U. S. TikTok users\nis not “a subtle means of exercising a content preference.” Turner I , 512 U. S., at 645. The prohibitions,\nTikTok-specific designation, and divestiture requirement regulate\nTikTok based on a content-neutral data collection interest. And\nTikTok has special characteristics—a foreign adversary’s ability to\nleverage its control over the platform to collect vast amounts of\npersonal data from 170 million U. S. users—that justify this\ndifferential treatment. “[S]peaker distinctions of this nature are\nnot presumed invalid under the First Amendment.” Ibid. While we find that differential treatment was\njustified here, however, we emphasize the inherent narrowness of\nour holding. Data collection and analysis is a common practice in\nthis digital age. But TikTok’s scale and susceptibility to foreign\nadversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data\nthe platform collects, justify differential treatment to address\nthe Government’s national security concerns. A law targeting any\nother speaker would by necessity entail a distinct inquiry and\nseparate considerations. On this understanding, we cannot accept\npetitioners’ call for strict scrutiny. No more than intermediate\nscrutiny is in order. C As applied to petitioners, the Act satisfies\nintermediate scrutiny. The challenged provisions further an\nimportant Government interest unrelated to the suppression of free\nexpression and do not burden substantially more speech than\nnecessary to further that interest.[ 3 ] 1 The Act’s prohibitions and divestiture\nrequirement are designed to prevent China—a designated foreign\nadversary—from leveraging its control over ByteDance Ltd. to\ncapture the personal data of U. S. TikTok users. This\nobjective qualifies as an important Government interest under\nintermediate scrutiny. Petitioners do not dispute that the Government\nhas an important and well-grounded interest in preventing China\nfrom collecting the personal data of tens of millions of U. S.\nTikTok users. Nor could they. The platform collects extensive\npersonal information from and about its users. See H. R. Rep.,\nat 3 (Public reporting has suggested that TikTok’s “data collection\npractices extend to age, phone number, precise location, internet\naddress, device used, phone contacts, social network connections,\nthe content of private messages sent through the application, and\nvideos watched.”); 1 App. 241 (Draft National Security Agreement\nnoting that TikTok collects user data, user content, behavioral\ndata (including “keystroke patterns and rhythms”), and device and\nnetwork data (including device contacts and calendars)). If, for\nexample, a user allows TikTok access to the user’s phone contact\nlist to connect with others on the platform, TikTok can access “any\ndata stored in the user’s contact list,” including names, contact\ninformation, contact photos, job titles, and notes. 2 id .,\nat 659. Access to such detailed information about U. S. users,\nthe Government worries, may enable “China to track the locations of\nFederal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal\ninformation for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.” 3 CFR\n412. And Chinese law enables China to require companies to\nsurrender data to the government, “making companies headquartered\nthere an espionage tool” of China. H. R. Rep., at 4. Rather than meaningfully dispute the scope of\nthe data TikTok collects or the ends to which it may be used,\npetitioners contest probability, asserting that it is “unlikely”\nthat China would “compel TikTok to turn over user data for\nintelligence-gathering purposes, since China has more effective and\nefficient means of obtaining relevant information.” Brief for\nTikTok 50 (internal quotation marks omitted). In reviewing the\nconstitutionality of the Act, however, we “must accord substantial\ndeference to the predictive judgments of Congress.” Turner\nI , 512 U. S., at 665 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). “Sound\npolicymaking often requires legislators to forecast future events\nand to anticipate the likely impact of these events based on\ndeductions and inferences for which complete empirical support may\nbe unavailable.” Ibid. Here, the Government’s TikTok-related\ndata collection concerns do not exist in isolation. The record\nreflects that China “has engaged in extensive and years-long\nefforts to accumulate structured datasets, in particular on\nU. S. persons, to support its intelligence and\ncounterintelligence operations.” 2 App. 634. Even if China has not yet leveraged its\nrelationship with ByteDance Ltd. to access U. S. TikTok users’\ndata, petitioners offer no basis for concluding that the\nGovernment’s determination that China might do so is not at least a\n“reasonable inferenc[e] based on substantial evidence.” Turner\nII , 520 U. S., at 195. We are mindful that this law arises\nin a context in which “national security and foreign policy\nconcerns arise in connection with efforts to confront evolving\nthreats in an area where information can be difficult to obtain and\nthe impact of certain conduct difficult to assess.” Humanitarian\nLaw Project , 561 U. S., at 34. We thus afford the\nGovernment’s “informed judgment” substantial respect here. Ibid. Petitioners further argue that the Act is\nunderinclusive as to the Government’s data protection concern,\nraising doubts as to whether the Government is actually pursuing\nthat interest. In particular, petitioners argue that the Act’s\nfocus on applications with user-generated and user-shared content,\nalong with its exclusion for certain review platforms, exempts from\nregulation applications that are “as capable as TikTok of\ncollecting Americans’ data.” Brief for TikTok 43; see Brief for\nCreator Petitioners 48–49. But “the First Amendment imposes no\nfreestanding underinclusiveness limitation,” and the Government\n“need not address all aspects of a problem in one fell swoop.” Williams-Yulee v. Florida Bar , 575 U.S.\n433 , 449 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nFurthermore, as we have already concluded, the Government had good\nreason to single out TikTok for special treatment. Contrast Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn. , 564 U.S.\n786 , 802 (2011) (singling out purveyors of video games for\ndisfavored treatment without a persuasive reason “raise[d] serious\ndoubts about whether the government [wa]s in fact pursuing the\ninterest it invoke[d], rather than disfavoring a particular speaker\nor viewpoint”). On this record, Congress was justified in\nspecifically addressing its TikTok-related national security\nconcerns. 2 As applied to petitioners, the Act is\nsufficiently tailored to address the Government’s interest in\npreventing a foreign adversary from collecting vast swaths of\nsensitive data about the 170 million U. S. persons who use\nTikTok. To survive intermediate scrutiny, “a regulation need not be\nthe least speech-restrictive means of advancing the Government’s\ninterests.” Turner I , 512 U. S., at 662. Rather, the\nstandard “is satisfied ‘so long as the regulation promotes a\nsubstantial government interest that would be achieved less\neffectively absent the regulation’ ” and does not “burden\nsubstantially more speech than is necessary” to further that\ninterest. Ward , 491 U. S., at 799 (quoting United\nStates v. Albertini , 472 U.S.\n675 , 689 (1985); alteration omitted). The challenged provisions meet this standard.\nThe provisions clearly serve the Government’s data collection\ninterest “in a direct and effective way.” Ward , 491\nU. S., at 800. The prohibitions account for the fact that,\nabsent a qualified divestiture, TikTok’s very operation in the\nUnited States implicates the Government’s data collection concerns,\nwhile the requirements that make a divestiture “qualified” ensure\nthat those concerns are addressed before TikTok resumes U. S.\noperations. Neither the prohibitions nor the divestiture\nrequirement, moreover, is “substantially broader than necessary to\nachieve” this national security objective. Ibid. Rather than\nban TikTok outright, the Act imposes a conditional ban. The\nprohibitions prevent China from gathering data from U. S.\nTikTok users unless and until a qualified divestiture severs\nChina’s control. Petitioners parade a series of\nalternatives—disclosure requirements, data sharing restrictions,\nthe proposed national security agreement, the general designation\nprovision—that they assert would address the Government’s data\ncollection interest in equal measure to a conditional TikTok ban.\nThose alternatives do not alter our tailoring analysis. Petitioners’ proposed alternatives ignore the\n“latitude” we afford the Government to design regulatory solutions\nto address content-neutral interests. Turner II , 520\nU. S., at 213. “So long as the means chosen are not\nsubstantially broader than necessary to achieve the government’s\ninterest, . . . the regulation will not be invalid\nsimply because a court concludes that the government’s interest\ncould be adequately served by some less-speech-restrictive\nalternative.” Ward , 491 U. S., at 800; see ibid. (regulation valid despite availability of less restrictive\n“alternative regulatory methods”); Albertini , 472\nU. S., at 689; Clark v. Community for Creative\nNon-Violence , 468 U.S.\n288 , 299 (1984); Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent , 466 U.S.\n789 , 815–816 (1984). For the reasons we have explained, the\nchallenged provisions are “not substantially broader than\nnecessary” to address the Government’s data collection concerns. Ward , 491 U. S., at 800. Nor did the Government ignore\nless restrictive approaches already proven effective. Contrast McCullen v. Coakley , 573 U.S.\n464 , 490–494 (2014) (state law burdened substantially more\nspeech than necessary where State had not considered less\nrestrictive measures successfully adopted by other jurisdictions).\nThe validity of the challenged provisions does not turn on whether\nwe agree with the Government’s conclusion that its chosen\nregulatory path is best or “most appropriate.” Albertini ,\n472 U. S., at 689. “We cannot displace [the Government’s]\njudgment respecting content- neutral regulations with our own, so\nlong as its policy is grounded on reasonable factual findings\nsupported by evidence that is substantial for a legislative\ndetermination.” Turner II , 520 U. S., at 224. Those\nrequirements are met here. D In addition to the data collection concerns\naddressed above, the Government asserts an interest in preventing a\nforeign adversary from having control over the recommendation\nalgorithm that runs a widely used U. S. communications\nplatform, and from being able to wield that control to alter the\ncontent on the platform in an undetectable manner. See 2 App. 628.\nIn petitioners’ view, that rationale is a content-based\njustification that “taint[s]” the Government’s data collection\ninterest and triggers strict scrutiny. Brief for TikTok 41. Petitioners have not pointed to any case in\nwhich this Court has assessed the appropriate level of First\nAmendment scrutiny for an Act of Congress justified on both\ncontent-neutral and content-based grounds. They assert, however,\nthat the challenged provisions are subject to—and fail—strict\nscrutiny because Congress would not have passed the provisions\nabsent the foreign adversary control rationale. See Brief for\nTikTok 41–42; Brief for Creator Petitioners 47–50. We need not\ndetermine the proper standard for mixed-justification cases or\ndecide whether the Government’s foreign adversary control\njustification is content neutral. Even assuming that rationale\nturns on content, petitioners’ argument fails under the\ncounterfactual analysis they propose: The record before us\nadequately supports the conclusion that Congress would have passed\nthe challenged provisions based on the data collection\njustification alone. To start, the House Report focuses\noverwhelmingly on the Government’s data collection concerns, noting\nthe “breadth” of",
    "textpassage": "\"The Act makes it unlawful for any entity to provide certain services to 'distribute, maintain, or update' a 'foreign adversary controlled application' in the United States. §2(a)(1). Entities that violate this prohibition are subject to civil enforcement actions and hefty monetary penalties.\""
